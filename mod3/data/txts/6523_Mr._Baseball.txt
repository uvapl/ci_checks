4 - 4 tie in the bottom of the 9th. 2 on, 2 out, and a 3 and 2 count on Jack Elliot
who hit only .235 during the regular season
Shawn, this is really a tough spot for Elliot
to be in
Anytime you come off as hard a year as he had
seems like every little strike-out just comes back to haunt you at a moment like this
C'mon Jack! Park it!
Strike three!
4th ball for strike 3.  That'll even up
the count at 3 and 3
Jack! C'mon it's a long season. Let's go!
Huh?
Get in there and take another hack!
It looks like Elliot's really in a hole now
Yeah, you know this is the thing
that Elliot really didn't want
to fall behind in a count like this
Anytime you get that third strike on you
gets awfully tough to battle back
Strike four!
Strike four.  And that one was a dandy.
He is really struggling out there
Jack
Get in here and hit
Now
Let's go
Stay in there Jack!
You the man Jack, you the man!
Five!
Wow. Another forkball for strike five
Strike Six!
...how much longer I can watch this.  Does the league have a ruling on mercy killing?
Major league baby
Major league hangover coming down
What did we drink, like a gazillion brews?
Big day for ya, huh buddy?
First time in the show?
We're watchin' it over with ya
You know how you feel like you're nervous.  Thinking about how you are gonna do.  You'll do alright
Thinking every pitch has to be the right one
or else it's back down to the banana league
and your family would be all ashamed and the pretty senioritas,
they'd just be gigglin' at ya
and the kids that used to worship you
now they just make goat noises and run away
You can't be thinking about that Manuel what ya gotta remember now Manuel, look at me,
Manuel, look at me
Baseball is a game, and games are
supposed to be fun
Uh-oh! Somebody call the fire department!
Damn...
What is that 500 feet?
Nah, it's 480 tops.
Who is he?
That's that rookie first baseman, Davis
Over the palm tree
Ah, don't worry about it Jack the guy's got an obvious weakness
What's that?
Kryptonite
Anybody can pull the ball...
...at batting practice
Jack!
Hey! Doc!
Hey Doc! Mornin', good to see ya!
I've got a little problem Jack
What?
Well... They've pulled your lawnmower commercial. The whole campaign's bye-bye. Image problem
Why?
I look good sittin' on that tractor!
Why!?
Hello?
Hey don't do that! Now stop that!
Anybody home?
Two weeks ago you were all over the papers getting nailed doing a hundred and twenty...
4 A.M., two broads...
All right, OK
Kinda make you waving from your Alfy a freakin' joke Jack
Hey Jack!
You came all the way out here to tell me that?
<i>Hey Elliot, how about an autograph?</i>
No. I'm out to see my new client
Jack
Jack
Jack
What Trey?
Skip wants to see you
Have a seat pal
That's OK
Now Elliot, you know I think the goddamn of you
and you know there is no one in the whole goddamn world I'd rather see out there than the old goddamn number 48
Skip, c'mon. I mean, I know I haven't exactly
been raking the ball lately but gimme a couple weeks
Jesus Christ Elliot, can I finish a sentence in my own goddamn office?
Hey, OK
This Davis kid is the real thing
The way it's looking...
Aw, c'mon
Is that what this is all about?
I mean he's a goddamn rookie for Christ's sake
You gonna be impressed with a 500-foot home run?
Yeah...
So what are you saying?
You gonna play me behind this kid?
We wouldn't do that to you
The word's 'come down' Jack
See who will pick up his contract
Line 'em up, let Jack make his trade
I don't believe this
I'm a world series MVP
That was four years ago Jack
You hit .235 last season
Last season?
I led this club in 9th inning doubles
in the month of August
Screw it man, I don't wanna play
where I'm not wanted
What are my choices?
I'm ready
There aren't exactly choices Jack
We only had one taker so we... took
We called everyone Jack
Canada...
No, not Canada!
It goes without saying
I ain't paying those taxes!
It's not Canada
Not Cleveland...
No! Say it's not Cleveland!
Not Cleveland
We got a call from a manager in...
What?
...Japan
Japan?
Yes, the uh... chu-chey? chu?
Forget it!
Chunichi
No
I'm a major leaguer!
There's no way I'm gonna play in Japan!
If you wanna play this season Jack,
you're a Chunichi Dragon
A what?
A Chunichi Dragon
<i>Welcome to Nagoya International Airport</i>
Welcome Jack Elliot
I am Yoji Nishimura
Arriving refreshed?
Arriving drunk and dead tired
Excellent! Places to go, people to meet!

My number's 48.  Always 48
Carefully computed, now it's 54
What do you mean computed?
Number of home runs you are expected to hit
He wants to know what was your
main reason for coming to Japan?
Let's just say I had a yen to play here
She wants to know what do you think
of our country?
Already? Uh...
The airport's nice... uh... I guess
and there's lots of little people walking,
talking, very fast
Japan what you expected?
Where's all the temples and rice paddies?
That stuff
This is city
Yeah, it looks like Cleveland,

Come in,

Sorry.  You don't like?
Nah, you did good kid.
<i>CNN sports tonight is big league baseball. Our feature story centers around rookie phenom Ricky Davis of the New York Yankees</i>
<i>who in his first game went 4 for 5 with 3 home runs
and six RBIs
all the scores...</i>
Tell me this isn't it
This isn't it
You're the boss but is it?
Elliot-san!
Take your shoes off man!
They get upset if you don't take off your shoes
Yeah
Sorry
It'd be a shame to track any carpet on the mildew
This way please
Hey, Max Dubois. Around here they call me Hammer. Don't ask me why
Jack Elliot
Yeah, I know who you are man
I've been in Japan, not dead.
hanging Toshi, hanging
Jack
Hey, fine bunch of big swinging dicks
we've got here
Well, they'll warm up after a season or two
Well, I don't plan to be here that long
That's what I said going on five years ago
Want some ocha?
Huh?
It's Japanese tea
Now let me get this straight
you're an American right?
Over here, I'm gaijin, same as you
gaijin?
It's like being a black guy back home
only there's less of us
gotcha
What the hell is that?
it's your first beat baby
I'll see ya out there
Elliot-san this is Uchiyama-san
your manager.
Welcome to Dragons
Sorry
Where ya hittin' me boss?
That will be decided after determining your
skill in Japanese baseball
Well, it's got a stick and a ball and a fence right?
It has many elements, all of which must work in harmony
Also must work on physical condition
Also must shave moustache
Tell him, this is the way he hired me at
and if my moustache gets in the way of my swing...
I'll shave it
Our manager Uchiyama-san was
Rookie of the Year in 1959
MVP in '61, '62 and '63
and '69
Holds the record for most consecutive
home run games in the history of the sport
7 in '71
He is very proud of that
We're all proud of that
He's the most revered manager in all of Japan
Yes, but he needs Captain Jack to bring home
the pennant Yoj-ster
let us not forget that
thank you, thank you!
Thank you
Any of you guys speak Americano?
Jack Elliot here, bringing you the best in major league thrills for the fellas and free moustache rides for the ladies
I have seen free moustache rides offered on T-Shirts in America
Always by guys you would not want to ride with
Sorry
Are you free tonight for dinner?
Did I miss something here?
What's the catch?
No catch.  We have business to discuss
Where and when?
I'll pick you up at your apartment. 9 o'clock
Uh, my apartment
What, you know where I live?
OK, OK!
What is this?
Practice
For what? Russian dance contests?
Hey hey! No slack dude!
Easy boys, easy!
Uchiyama-san wants to know why you are not working with the team
Oh, well you tell him I got a bad wheel
Perhaps your wheel get stronger with work
You tell the chief that I've got my own exercises
He said Dragons must all work together for harmony
and if you cannot do team exercises
Our team will do yours
Hai
Hats off!
OK, ready?
Face, stretch!
Moon...
Exercise
Aw, man I don't believe this
Turn around
OK, face front
Right foot, in
Right foot, out
Right foot, in
Shake it all about
Do the hokey pokey!
Turn yourself around
That's what it's all about
This is crazy Max.
We're not athletes,
we're baseball players
batting practice
finally
All yours babe
Yo
I could piss over that fence
Yeah, well don't
Don't spit on the field either
it's considered sacred
At least they got that right
Perhaps weight more on the front foot and more top hand, he says
Thanks a lot
You have a hole in your swing, he says
Ball can't seem to find it
What's going on here Max?
Probably wants to see if you are as good with your bat as you are with your mouth
man...
What the hell was that?
What the hell is a <i>'shuuto'</i>?
Great equalizer
<i>(Note: shuuto = similar to a reverse slider)</i>
Great
fine...
Shit!
Let's go
Can't do that here slugger
He showed me up
You don't know the difference Max. You've been here too long.
Shoes dude
Look man, I have to deal with it, you gotta deal with it
What the hell is that?
Rita-san.  Visage of death
You should put equipment away then sit down please
Sorry Jack-san
I don't believe this
What's next?
Come here to tell me how to take a crap?
Hey Max!
Yeah?
Need someone to tell me how to take a crap.
Aw man...
What?
First you wash, then you bathe
I hate this place
Hammer!
What's up?
How are you doing man?
It's all right.
Everybody here he is, Jack Elliot
Well, welcome to the little league Meat
Hey Rye. How are you doing? You still spiking guys with a pick on?
Don't worry none about that Meat.  We're all on the same team here right boys?
That's right
Absolutely
Allen Evan
Welcome aboard, good to see ya man
Lyle Massi
Nice to meet you Jackson
Billy Stevens Jack, used to be with the Orioles.
Sure Billy. How's it going?
Well, once you get used to sleeping in shoe boxes and chasing your food around the table it's uh, pretty much a nightmare over here huh?
Uh-huh true story
Hey, check it out guys. Check it out!
Our favorite video!
Hey, hey Japanese rocket scientists at work!
On behalf of The Animal, Hammer, Fly-by, Supersonic and the Hit-man
Welcome to Japan Mr. <i>BESUBORU</i>
Mr. What?
Mr. Baseball! Right here baby
Hey,
That's right!
Read it to them Rye
Yeah
When asked his impression of his new manager, Elliot replied, "I have much to learn from Uchiyama-san..."
"...and I'll gladly strive to shed all my old disgusting ways of laziness and become my best under his guidance"
Very harmonious of you Meat
Yoji
Yoji would be your assigned interpreter?  Am I right?
That's right
Well, let us tell you a few things about your new neighbors over here Jack
First you got your gaijin strike zone.
Roughly the size of a Buick
and I hope you didn't bring your dick with you
You rang, Mr. Baseball?
I rang, Mr. Wise-Ass!
What? What? What What?
I don't understand
Understand this
Please, you see, all wisecrack making, make you seem disrespectful
I just do this for you to save face. Besides, press writes their own story anyway.
I'll deal with the press
and I'll take care of my own face.  You just translate what comes out of it.  You got me?
Hai...
Hai?
"Hai" as in 'Yes'?
or "Hai" as in, "I understand but I'm not gonna do a goddamn thing about it" ?
That's right Yoj.  Gaijin catching on!
Hai!... Yes.
Be right down!
You know her?
Hai.  Yes.
What are my chances?
Many torrents.
Speak English Yoji.
Difficulties surround her
Well that's the story of my life.  Why should Japan be any different?
What kind of business did you think I meant Mr. Elliot?
Well I wasn't sure
Funny business?
Monkey business?
Hey I'm new here huh.  Give me a break will ya?
No, please, tell me
You thought I was trying to get through your pants?
<i>in</i> my pants?
<i>'in your pants'</i>.  Hai
Well, where I come from
If a pretty girl
smiles at you from the stands and offers to buy you dinner
usually... that means... that you know she's...
Ready for party action?
Possibly
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.  I hope you are not disappointed.
No.
No. Not a bit
Not a bit? Mr. Elliot?
Well maybe a little bit
Call me Jack
OK.  Jack
<i>'Hirako'</i>
No, Hiroko
Hi-ro-ko
Oh, in Japan, never pour your own drink
I hope you don't mind.  I took the liberty of ordering for both of us
Delicious Japanese dish
Oh, OK but uh, listen no offense.  I don't eat bait.
bait?
Yeah you know uh, what do you guys call it?  You know raw fish, stuff like that I...don't...
Hey!
Sorry! Little joke
French restaurant.
Japanese beef--the best you'll ever eat.
I betcha never been to Kansas City?
No...
just New York
I studied at Parsons School of Design
Someday, I hope to return there with my work
This is good!
Kobe beef.  Fed with beer, massaged by hand.
Oh, I should have signed up to be a cow here instead of a ball player.
This is really good.  This is better than Kansas City
and you know something, I gotta admit I didn't want to eat Japanese.
This is very Japanese
Japan takes the best from all over the world and makes it her own
You have done commercials before, haven't you?
Yes, of course I have
Doing commercials in Japan is no different
Except I got no choice?!
You gotta be kidding...
I am afraid not.  Read your contract
The Dragons can license me out for endorsements and I got no say in it?
You are property of the team.
I'm a player on the team.  Big difference.
It's in your contract.  Believe me.
Don't worry.  I'll see to it that you appear in a dignified and normal way.
That's not the point.
Dragons hire you for your skill.  But also for image of team
Yea, well I'm a baseball player not a goddamn mascot.
Don't look at it that way
What? Japan takes the best from all over the world and makes it her own?  Well not this one honey
Jack please.
Hey what's a couple of cocktails cost around here? About 50 billion of these things? That oughta cover it.
Don't go
Sorry
Business concluded
Where do I live?
Welcome to pre-game warm up.  Let's go!
Hey!
Looking good Max! Get down!
Shake that thing white boy!
Safe!
Actual baseball is actually occurring.
Jack, you're on.
Same to you
<i>Ouu, major leaguer!</i>
You got that right
You big, you can hit c'mon!
Fine
What the hell's he doing? Coulda given us the lead!
Well better get used to it.  Why would he wanna risk it? Lose face.
With a puss like his, what's he afraid of?
Yeah, by the way, we're doing a pick-off move
Now!
<i>MISTA BESUBORU TOO FASSU!</i>
Thanks
Got any naked pictures of your wife?
Wanna see some?
Never mind
Outta there!
Toshi!
Yeah?
Hey what the hell you doing? You gotta get dirty. You gotta break that thing up.
Easy, easy Jack, easy!
It's not his fault.
It's disrespectful to take a guy out with a slide
That's horseshit man
Sorry kid, we'll get 'em next inning.
Uh, there ain't gonna be a next inning
What are you talking about?  It's 4 - 4
No game can continue after 15 innings
So when do we make it up?
I'm sorry babe, it's over
it's 4 - 4 ball game can't end in a goddamn tie!
C'mon man it's over let's go
What are we doing here Max?
I know what I'm doing here.
What are you doing here?!
I just keep thinking someone's gonna see what I'm doing over here and give me a shot in the bigs.
Please don't be fooled by your good game.  You still have a hole in your swing.
Please don't be fooled by thinking this is baseball!
Don't play to win...
After an eleven-game road trip in which he hit successfully in ten of the games
and brought in the winning run in 5 of the games
While dazzling the fans with his skill and style in the field...
...exemplified by a spectacular grab over hard line drive to shut the door against the swallows Thursday night
...add it all up, Jack Elliot truly is proving to be Mr. Baseball
Some write-up ne?
Yeah
You're not pleased
No, no, I'm pleased
just wishing it was in the New York daily news
Big hit! Happy body!
Cut!
What?!
Now what?
Missed your mark again.
What?
Well tell him to move the mark to where I'm standing
It doesn't work that way
Hey, this is not my idea.  I don't wanna be here
Everyone is well aware of that
and this is your idea of dignified and noble
it is
says you.  Hey pal, one more take and I'm outta here!
You're outta here when we get the shot Jack!
Push comes to shove y'know you're like all the rest of 'em
How's that?
Japanese way.  Shut up and take it.
Jack's way, 'ME, ME, ME'! Sometimes acceptance and cooperation are strengths also.
Giants doesn't beat us
Are you sleeping in the Giants games?
Did I miss something here?
Don't mess with him today Jack
Giants are like the national team around here.  They almost always kick the shit out of us
You are disgracing the Dragons' uniform
lower than the lowliest dogs
Lower than the lowliest dogs?
Hai
Wow!
That's low
Quiet!
Nice speech coach
gave me goose bumps
Get in there buddy
Shuuto?
No problem
Strike!
C'mon Igi
this ain't no college ball
You got lucky Billy.
But not in this league man.  Half these guys gift wrap it for you.
Oh no...
man...
Igi doesn't dive so he pulls Itori
Don't look for logic here man.  It's the Giants.
C'mon boys
We're beating ourselves here
We need a little fire
We need a little kamikaze
a little banzai! Wake up in here!
Yes!
See? It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
Yes, Max! Very nice
Time
Did I read that sign right?
He must move runner.  Get him in a position to tie.
You don't pay me to bunt
What?
What?!
I suggest you bunt
I suggest you bunt!
man...
Shuuto
Shit!
Man... a month ago I was a New York Yankee and here I am getting my balls busted in Japanese
Save it man, you're gonna need it
Because as of tonight, all over Japan, they're practicing Shuutos
Got me?
...just a bad manager
Oh, just kidding chief.  You're a dream come true
It has been decided that you are fined 50,000 yen for disobeying your manager on the field
Also, 10,000 for disrespect your equipment
He wants to know what the second one is for
That's for the next time
He wonders when the next time will be
Uchiyama-san is reminded, you are hitting off the front foot and your top hand must come over more
Jack-san, Jack-san, you shouldnÅft be smoking
Aren't you gonna translate the sports page for me?
You love doing that
It's mostly about your <i>srump</i> (slump)
I'm not in a <i>sRump</i>
Just having a few slow days
See hitting is like the tides.  There's high tide, there's low tide.  Then there's high tide again.
Low tide almost two weeks long
Starting to stink-up your harbor
I'm not in a goddamn slump
I hate this place
Yea?
Hello Doc
Greetings from Japan
Jack?
Yea, it's me
So how are things back home
Just great Jack
Hey, hell of a connection.  You sound like you are right down the street
Oh I wish I was Doc
Listen, you gotta get me outta here
Sorry buddy no can do
not right now anyway
not while youÅfre hitting down around .200 Jack
in Japan, Jack!
C'mon Doc
Jack, don't you think I would have you here if I could?
Yeah, I hear ya
So how's your new client Doc?
C'mon Jack, I know you've been following his stats
<i>yeah well, it won't last</i>
Bet he doesn't have the endorsements I used to have
No, Jack, he doesn't
What's he have Doc?
Spike Lee is shooting his Nike commercial
I'll see ya Jack
Thanks... Doc
Big hit! Happy body!
I saw your commercial.  It's uh... interesting
This is for purified. Washing your hands
Look, I'm sorry for the way that I acted
Well,
it wasn't your cup of coffee to begin with
tea
it's cup of <i>tea</i>
Hai, tea
temple?
shrine
Where's all those little bald guys with sheets and stuff?
That's temple
Shrine, you make offering and pray
Throwing money, ring the bell to wake up the god
Clap twice,
close my eyes,
Go ahead
Clap twice,
close your eyes
Right, sorry
I have heard many come on lines in my time.
but, "Hiroko, take me to a temple" is new one
That's not a line
I thought this zen deal might do me some good y'know kinda...
groove on all those rocks and gardens
maybe shed a little light on what's wrong with my swing
The temple I had in mind is farther on
If you want to have a wise brain
draw it here,
here, to here
If you want to have a big, wide heart, draw it here
OK, I'm good
So quickly?
I had a vision of what I need
...and that is?
Well, it was kind of fuzzy at first
but then it was like a ray of light that kinda shone down on it
Yes?
it was the biggest, coldest beer I've ever seen
always making jokes.
Hey, I came, I saw, I gave it a whirl.
It is not enough just to show up
I thought it was ninety percent of life just to show up
You must accept and welcome and try before you can learn
Yes, dear.
Do not make fun of me
Hey, I'm sorry!
I am not like hostess, here to tell you how great you are.
And I am not Japanese man expecting you to, so cool your jets OK?
What?
OK...
Four things that I accept about myself:
Problems with authority, the attention span of a gnat, a bad right knee
...and trouble understanding women
acceptance is only the first step
OK... OK
you had a vision of a beer?
Hai.
That was great
thanks.
You're welcome
Would you like to come up for some tea?
tea?
Yeah
No, thank you
Well
OK
but another beer...
yes, please
Where did you go?
I have prepared a bath for you
I'm really not much of a bath guy
Please
OK
No peeking
Whoa! Ha-hello, it's a little hot!
Accept
...accept. Yeah, yeah
accept
Jack, it's OK?
What?
Are you coming in?
I'm not peeking
...erm, Hiroko
Tell me, what is your deepest fear?
We will wash it away.
My deepest fear?
Yes
Well, we were at Boston,
We're down 3 to 1 and I'm walking up to the plate y'know.  There's two men on.
And somebody yells, "Hey, Jack. C'mon.  Park it!"
and, I heard him
and I'm ready y'know I'm just standing there,
staring at my bat like I do y'know...
and I remember thinking,
I remember at that exact moment
I'm thinking...
Don't miss
Just don't miss.
My whole life
I wanted to hit the ball, then all of a sudden I'm trying not to miss
You
will
hit
I'm a baseball player
I've been a baseball player all my life
Even before I was a baseball player I was a baseball player
I don't think I could be anything else
Say it:
I
will
hit
I will hit
Can I say something else?
Um... listen Hiroko, I mean...
I know this is some kind of very... innocent, uhh, very Japanese thing that-that we're doing here but
Y'know I'm still a gaijin
and one that hasn't exactly
been with a woman in a while...
and... I'm a little you know...
You know what I mean?
accept it
I will hit,
I will hit,
... I will hit.
nuts!
Hey, Yoji!
(I could) use a little help here
Calling a goddamn <i>ball</i> in here?  That ball was shining my shoes
Strike!
Can you take it easy man? I told you about this shit.  C'mon babe
C'mon!
Take a risk damn it!
Safe?  Safe?!
My foot was on the bag.  It was glued to the goddamn bag.
Right there, right there!
Well mayb--all right maybe there
Fine.  Deal with the chief.
Jack-san, shut your big mouth
You are humiliating the team
Just play your position and stop all the bullshit right now! Please!
Y'know <i>Muki</i>
Mukai
Yeah, I'm sorry uh, what I'm thinking here is one of the duties of a captain,
and you're a, you're a fine one don't get me wrong
one of the things a captain does is find little ways to get the team y'know... up
laughing, get the boys' minds off their trouble and let them know it's OK to loosen up a little
Baseball is a game
and games are supposed to be fun
No, Jack.
No!
He tipped his hat, he tipped his hat!
No! Jack!
Jack, damn it.  He tipped his hat.  That means he didn't mean it.
I don't care if he ate his goddamn hat.  I've had it.
Jack-san no!
Bullshit!
I'm sick and tired of your shit.  Haven't you heard a word I've said? You are really pissing me off now.
Now just take your base and get with the program!
You too, huh Max?
You know the one thing I didn't miss about playing in the States?
Was putting up with hotshots like you.
Now I don't even have that anymore!
Damn it!
Taking my base Chief. Taking my base.
Look, I didn't see him tip his goddamn hat all right?
Go get 'em kid.
The drummer is doing fine without your assistance
Well I gotta do something, you don't seem to want to talk to me.
We are almost there
Does your father know that we've been doing it?
I don't discuss my sex life with him.
No.
but, I'm a big girl.  I can do what I want.
Well Hiroko, in my experience
all girls are always little girls to their fathers.
and dads have this very special attitude that they lay on the guy
that is doing it to their little girl
and I bet that that's sort of an international attitude
I hope the two of you will find other things to discuss.
Well, y'know I'm just having so much fun already.
We are here
They love me already, I can tell.
What?
Accept.
I am. I am.
They're fabulous.  Especially granddad.  What a card!
Uh-oh...
That's great, Hiroko, just great...
Accept.
No, I don't accept!
What the hell were you thinking of?
I was thinking of you
You were thinking of me?
Then why the hell didn't you tell me your dad was the Chief?
Not the Chief.
We are not at the ball park
Call me Uchiyama, please.
Whoa
You sly guy!
Uchiyama please.
You've been holding out all this time
I am the Japanese manager of a Japanese baseball team that you agreed to play for.
It is your duty to learn my ways.  Not the other way around.
Different language.  Same attitude.  Let's go.
We can't!
We can't.  It would be a big insult to leave.
The big insult here is the way you set me up.
My grandmother has gone to a lot of trouble to prepare a traditional meal.
Hiroko is right.
For the first time today.
I'm asking you...
Please,
please come in.
It's polite
It's OK.
Jack
Aw... man.
What?
Bad luck
What did he say?
He says, "You have a hole in your swing."
Like father, like son huh?
Everyone can see it but you
and you, Jack!
Grow up!
Uh, Hiroko
Wait
Don't bother
Wait!
Mr. Elliot.  There is no way you are leaving here with her today.
What?
I know my daughter
She had this all planned.  Right down to her exit.
Man, that's some piece of work you raised.
Her mother raised her.  Like mother, like daughter.
Please let's go outside.
K?
Situation is this.  You will not be playing baseball anywhere and I will not be managing
...unless you can start hitting again.
They're gonna fire you...
Yes.
Why?
You were my choice and so my responsibility, and I failed to control you.
I thought I was everybody's choice?
Management wanted Pete, Clifton or Boston
No shit...
Why'd you want me?
I looked at the tapes
Clifton is steady, but he will never get back his top game.
You were sloppy, but you had a big season left in you
at least, I thought so.
Was I right?
Hey, tapes don't lie
You wanna find out?
Yes
K
must be my way
... or the highway
K, I'm ready
Push yourself!
C'mon, c'mon push yourself! C'mon, c'mon!
You can do it! You gotta pick it up!
C'mon, C'mon! Hundred? OK
Face stretch now?
No joking.
No joking. Hai.
What about hitting?
Not ready to hit yet.
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
Can give me a hand here...
Sorry! I didn't know my own strength!
You all right?
Forgot my strength too.
Hey! Ready Chief!
C'mon, c'mon, come on!
You look thirsty Chief
What do you say I buy you a beer?
Later.  Again
You're no fun anymore
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!  Pick it up! Pick it up!
Harder! Harder, Jack!
I'll be damned.
<i>Get your ass in gear!</i>
He speaks English
Shit
Twenty.  That's enough.  Time for rest
What do you think I am?  A pussy?
Pussy?
Time for nice massage
Hey, Chief y'know, the hot bath was really enough.  Honest.
Marika-san?
You kidders
What about hitting?
You're not ready to hit yet!
I don't want to be in a fight
and this...
is French.  Japan has not made this her own.  Not yet.
Thank you
OK
Uh... your intentions
were good.
But in the future
I would hope that you would trust me
We have a future?
I hope so.
Yes?
Mm-hm
From now on, different
Because
Jack and Hiroko
Accept one another
That's the best thing
See you tonight
OK
Is there any reason that you couldn't tell me they were from the same gene pool?
I told you Jack-san
When? OK.  When did you tell me?
I said, "Many torrents."
Difficulties surround her.
See, just because you speak English doesn't mean we speak the same language
See...
None of those things mean she is Uchiyama's daughter!
Remember?
"I'll take care of my own face",
"You just translate what comes out of it"
All right, OK OK, fine
but in the future
Jack-san
You want Yoji's advice about the babes,
you come to Yoji with respect.
Hai
"Hai"
As in yes?
"Hai" as in yes
Yes
Hold on a minute boys.
Now,
you're ready to hit
What the hell does this have to do with anything?
Different perspective.  Same task.
Find the ball with the bat
I wanna hit baseballs!
What did you say?
I said I wanna hit
That's what, I want to hear.
Again
Heard there's a Japanese tradition
get drunk and tell off your boss
he can't hold it against you
You got some bad habits of your own.  Namely your attitude
My attitude?
That's right
My attitude provides the foundation for this team.
Bullshit.
Bullshit?
Bullshit.  Yeah, that's right.  These kids can play ball.  That's the foundation of this team.
And you know what?  They could be even better if you didn't scare the shit out of 'em.
You got them so uptight they couldn't get a greased BB up their butt.
Greased BB what?
Grea--You heard me
I make them the best they can be!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well try letting your pitchers pitch their way out of trouble sometime.  Y'know they might just
reach down, and show you a little something.  They surprise the hell out of you.
and some of your boys, they got speed.  Let 'em stretch a single.  They might not...
You wouldn't have to bunt all the time!
Just...
let 'em have a little fun
Baseball is work.  Not fun.
Baseball?
Baseball is grown men getting paid to play a game
When you were a little kid I bet you didn't pick up a bat and a ball because you were dying to work
a player's career is short enough
Let 'em enjoy it.
Are you finished?
Not quite.
Hiroko?
Leave my daughter out of this!
Hey, Japanese tradition. Anything I want.
You wouldn't wanna break a tradition would ya?
Now listen to me
Hiroko
is a major pain in the ass but so what? So are you
So am I
and she's a terrific girl
...woman
and you ought to tell her that sometime
To what do you attribute your renewed power?
"Big Hit! Happy Body!"
You are on your way to
breaking Uchiyama-san's record for consecutive homerun games
any friction between the two of you guys?
I think uh... if it meant beating the Giants he would be all for it
Moshi-moshi.
<i>Hey Jack what do you say big guy?</i>
Doc?
Who else?
Uh, good morning.
Uh, afternoon here in civilization Sport, which is where I hope to have you a couple days from now.
What are you talking about?
<i>I'm talking about bringing you home.  Rich Lovett broke his wrist</i>
the Dodgers need power and I told them you're the man.
<i>I'm flying over with Howie Gold from their front office.  We're gonna be at the game on Thursday</i>
Hey that's great Doc.
Now they start a big series with Atlanta on Saturday and you're gonna be ready to fly with us all right?
See ya at the game big guy
What's "Great Doc"?
That was my agent.  He's flying over with a guy from the Dodgers
They're interested.
For next season?
No, for next weekend
and... you would go?
Well wouldn't you if you were me?
Send me a postcard
Aww, come on Hiroko
"come on" where?
Now, now, just cool your jets for a minute
Jet's temperature just fine.
Hey, look, y'know, maybe you could go with me?
Y'know you said you always wanted to go back someday.
Yes
Yeah
with plan. With purpose.
Not just to wave from stands like blonde Bambis
Bimbos
Like come on.  I think we're just getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here I mean...
nothing is definite
something very definite
definite that baseball and Jack always come before Hiroko and Jack.
Hey come on now gimme a break.  This is my job.
Not just job.  It's who you are.
You said it to me yourself.  Always been a ball player.
even before you were a ball player.  So go be a ball player.
But I'm not glove or bat you pack up and take along.
I am a woman.
I'll say
He's hit dingers in seven consecutive games and tonight he's going for the record.
Seven in a row.  Consecutive games?
That's right
Whoa, I hope I'm not getting in anybody's way here.
Excuse me
Jack-san, Mukai-san wants to talk to you
He wants you to know that
although at first he didn't like you
just that you're just another gaijin helper
but now, he respects you very much
he has learned much from you about how to play baseball
he truly believes that you are the real Mr. Baseball
about breaking Uchiyama-san's record,
is a big thing
but please challenge it
Mukai-san and all teammates are rooting for you
Uh, tell him
I owe you Mukai!
Let's kick ass!
Ball
Shit
He's scared of you Jack
Ball
Ball three
Hey! Greetings fellow American.  They don't like gaijin breaking their records.
There's a thousand dollar fine for every strike they throw you babe
He ripped that one
Yes!
Oh, what a play!
We'll get 'em
Aw man
Hey!
Stand up Itoi, he ain't coming out
There ya go
Now I buy the pussies
Nono, now you own the pussies
Own the pussies...
"Own the pussies" da.
Ball
If that was a strike it'd be out of the question
Ball two
Ball three
What?
Get outta here.  Get outta here!
Get outta here!
Smile Chief
and yet we're losing
Hey, we're behind.  Big difference
You're way is not working
We're playing like a team here Chief. Don't back out on 'em now.
C'mon girls! Rally caps
Rally caps, let's go, let's go. C'mon
You all right?
Tip your hat!
Tip your hat damn it!
Get off of me!
C'mon
Hey, just like back home huh?
Got any naked pictures of your wife?
No, but I got some of yours
Hey Max! He's got to let him hit now. Right?
He may have loosened up a little.  Still Uchi
Did I read that sign right?
Yes.
Swing away
Maybe I'll break your record
I said,
swing away
Yes. Chief.
C'mon Jack baby!
Jack-san! C'mon!
Smack it!
Safe!
Yes!
It's gonna cost you Chief!
Hey, I hope you're packed.  We're leaving from Tokyo at noon tomorrow.
You're gonna love playing in LA.
The Dodgers will get a good use out of you.  Believe me.
Have you got family back home?
Wife and two kids in Jersey.
Well, fly 'em down to Atlanta. They could join you there.
All right. Hey thanks Howie.
My pleasure.
Thanks
Hey Jack,
Good game Jack.
Not exactly. I couldn't get a pitch
Howie Gold. LA Dodgers
Hey Howie
Listen Jack, the straight shot is that Howie's a...
I owe you one Jack
So do I
Hey, you glad?
I'm glad
You're back
I'm back
I'll be back there hitting them over your head in no time
I know you will
Hey this guy try and sign you yet?
I'll be thinking about it
Be careful.
Jack-san
Big Chief
Hey! Jack-san!
I didn't see my daughter in the stands
Yeah, uh, well I'm afraid some of you Uchiyamas are just a little too stubborn for this old boy.
Stubborn
but worth it
Yes?
Hai.
Tell me what happened.
Hai.
Your man's still got it
Yeah, he does.
Wow! What a shot!
That's long
Hello.
No.  Tell them to hold off.  I'll fax the new set in an hour. OK?
Thank you. Bye.
OK
All right now you keep this shoulder in, keep it in and just explode your hips right through the ball
and trust your hands
Thanks Chief
What did you call me?
Coach.
Thanks Coach
No, that's OK kid
Call me Chief
