There you are!
And how was your day? Any progress in saving the world?
I'm working on it.
So I guess you changed your mind about tonight?
Not really. Told you I didn't want to miss it.
What happened with that dinner with the London people?
- You made it sound so unavoidable.
- It was.
Fortunately, they missed their plane.
Here's to...
...stolen moments.
You look so handsome, I better see if I can catch up.
Nobody home?
I left some Security Council transcripts out
but everybody's gone.
Anything earth-shattering?
No, it's just important enough not to be left out.
You look incredible.
Yeah, but we have to hurry.
I prefer this one.
Right.
<i>Can I have a picture, please?</i>
<i>This way. This way, please.</i>
<i>This way, please.</i>
<i>One more.</i>
There's Andrew. Good to see him. Robynn, hi.
Steven, how are you?
- Nice to see you.
- Emily, you look wonderful.
Keep up the good work.
That's Steven Taylor and his wife, Emily.
Well, at last!
The beautiful people have arrived.
- Fantastic dress!
- Thank you.
I didn't expect to see you tonight, with Greenspan and all.
Why's that?
I thought you'd be up to your ass in alligators.
Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
All I need is her phone number.
Absolutely. I must see about something.
Lovely! Thank you, darling.
The temple's hieroglyphics are supplications...
...to the gods of fertility.
I do believe I know his work.
Perhaps we could come along to your studio one day...
You said he wasn't coming.
He changed his mind. I tried to call you.
What are we going to do?
Nothing. Just relax.
- He doesn't know who I am, right?
- No.
You're a peach.
Lunch tomorrow?
And tomorrow...
...and tomorrow.
So I leave you alone for 30 seconds, and you elope with a younger man.
Steven, I'd like to introduce you to David Shaw.
- Pleasure! Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
David is a painter.
I saw some of his pieces downtown. I thought they were amazing
What brings you uptown to our little inbred soirée?
Actually, Emily was kind enough to wrangle me an invite.
Me too.
So tell me about your work...
...David?
A couple small galleries carry me when there's space.
- You studied formally?
- Berkeley, Cal Arts.
Almost formally graduated too.
Too much study pollutes the soul.
- And he's good?
- He's wonderful.
I'd love to see your pieces. Maybe we can arrange a time.
- Whenever you want.
- Emily has your number?
No. The gallery can get ahold of me. You know which one?
Oh, yes, yes...
If you're as good as she says...
...I'll pass the word on to my acquisitive friends.
Thanks. That's very generous.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
Pleasure to see you.
<i>We cannot be held accountable...</i>
<i>...for the actions of others that require us to defend ourselves.</i>
Madame Ambassador.
This is the same speech he gave in Geneva 3 months ago...
word for word.
Show-off!
- Ann, good morning, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.
Steven, spreads are blowing out.
The way things look in Europe, it could turn into a bloodbath
- So what are we talking?
- At least 1'50 basis points.
The Bundesbank will have to tag along
Your yen and mark positions will get hammered
So what's our exposure?
Based on my preliminary trend model?
Yes. No frills
Think Chernobyl
<i>Greenpoint, next stop</i>
- What you got there?
- It's a little surprise
Come on up
Here's your fortune
<i>"You have a deep interest in all that is artistic"</i>
It's true
You didn't have to get this for me
You need a little civilizing
What do you need?
What do you need?
You know, we could be in Belize this time tomorrow
Belize...
- You ever been there?
- No
You'd think you'd died and went to heaven
But I already think that
You look so pretty today
<i>Hey, it's David. Leave one. I'll get back to you</i>
<i>David, hi. It's Steven Taylor. I'm finishing a little early today</i>
<i>I thought I might come by and check out your work</i>
<i>Say about six</i>
<i>If that flies with you, call me at my office here at 5-4-4-...</i>
<i>...1-8-1-7</i>
<i>I look forward to seeing you</i>
What are you going to do?
I guess I'll call him
Be kind of weird if I didn't, wouldn't it?
You're playing with fire, David
If you're so upset about it, why'd you give him my number?
I didn't
Mr. Taylor?
Hi. Here, sit down
That was stupid. Sorry about that
Thanks very much
Drink?
No, I'm okay
Unless you want another one
I just had us meet here because my place is hard to find
Like an illegal loft space?
That's one way to put it
I feel like I'm knee-deep in bohemian cachet
Lead on
- How's Emily?
- She's fine, thank you
Well, be sure and say "hi"
I will
One more. One more floor
Building's over 100 years old now
Watch your step
Well, I can certainly see what Emily was drawn to
Yeah? What's that?
Your work. It's...
...very trashy...
...but potent
Trashy?
Is that what she said?
Your anger it's...
...it's very controlled
You think I'm angry?
The anger in your work
The color of despair
Wonder where that comes from
I don't know
Inside, I guess
Inside... indeed
Nowhere to sit but the goddamned bed
You know, I envy you
You envy me?
You should be...
...flattered. I'm not prone to envy
It's a pathetic emotion
Sneaks up on you like cancer
I've got it and you know why
- No
- Oh, of course you do
One of life's legitimately sublime experiences. It's so...
...utterly complete
What?
Fucking my wife
Mr. Taylor, I don't know...
I think it's about time you called me Steven
We're in love, sir
That's it?
You steal the crown jewel of a man's soul...
...and your only excuse is some candy-ass Hallmark card sentiment?
Even if it was true, that's not good enough!
If what were true?
She is in love
You, buddy...
...you're in business
What the hell are you saying?
I'm saying you did not meet my wife by chance
I'm saying you didn't study at Berkeley
I'm saying you learned to paint while doing 3 to 6 in Soledad Prison...
...for relieving a widow in San Francisco of her life savings
Your second conviction...
...if I'm not mistaken
Your real name is Winston Lagrange, which I rather like
Born to pure trailer trash in Barstow, California
Ward of the courts since the age of ten
You went from pickpocket to car thief to con man till you found out...
...that you had a way with the softer sex
No doubt looking for that mother you can barely remember
A life made up completely of depressing little scams...
...until now
Where'd you get all that?
All that is for sale. The hell of it is, you're not...
- ...half-bad with a brush
- Thank you
Called rehabilitation
It's called a con. My wife's the grand prize
But you set your sights too high this time
She loves me
She loves David Shaw, your invention
But you've made a fundamental miscalculation
Play it out
Love conquers all
Emily divorces me. She marries you
Given your history
her advisors are going to insist upon a prenup
You might storm the castle...
...but you ain't getting the keys to the treasure room, ever
I don't care about that
The swindler doesn't care about a trust fund
that can buy fucking Barstow?
Why don't you cut the shit!
You care, or we would not be having this conversation!
The only thing that stops you from bolting now
is bad genes and greed
Now what?
Choices
I can tell Emily who you are, and life will imitate art
You become a starving painter, game over
Or?
Or you can cash out
Cash out?
Half a million dollars
Tax-free
Just for walking away from her?
I said tax-free. I didn't say free
What's 500 grand for?
Killing my wife
Emily?
Imagine my embarrassment if they're not the same
$100,000 now...
...$400,000 after, cash-and-carry
You're out of your mind
Not really
Why?
I appreciate your curiosity, but my agenda doesn't concern you
I'll go straight to Emily and tell her all this
That would be my word against yours...
...Winston
And what if I call the cops?
Have you ever been to Boca Raton, Florida?
A lady there was carrying on with a younger man
He was a hell of a tennis player. When the affair ended...
...he disappeared...
...along with the lady's bearer bonds
You sure you've never been there?
Not that I recall
An acquaintance of mine has a photograph of the suspect
All they need is a name...
...as in, strike three
15 years
No parole
You think you got a box big enough to hold $100,000 in cash?
Come by the apartment around 12 o'clock tomorrow
Unless you have a previous luncheon engagement
I assume you know where I live
This is crazy. I not undestand. I'm your best friend, all right?
Half the year goes by and you don't say one thing?
Do you love him? Will you leave Steven?
Ok, but talk to me
I will if you shut up for one second
I'm waiting
I didn't tell you because you adore Steven, ok?
You cried at our wedding, for God's sake
- I cry at every wedding
- No, you don't
You like the idea of us
Everybody does
But you have no idea who he is
- Steven? I know Steven
- No, you don't
You don't know that everything always has to be on his terms, ok?
You don't know that he has no real interest in who I am
What are you going to do?
I don't know
I'm going to figure out a way to tell him. He deserves that
What makes you think he doesn't know?
Because there's no way
I mean, he knows that something's not right but...
This David have a last name?
Shaw. David Shaw
And he knows about your family?
What do you mean?
What do you think I mean?
C'mon. We don't talk about that kind of stuff
In six months, you never mentioned money?
No!
Believe me, okay?
David has absolutely no interest in anything other than painting and...
- ...and... me
- And you
Is that why you're not wearing your wedding ring?
Oh, my God!
What?
I left it at David's
Working late?
No, I was having a drink with Raquel
And how is the Castilian femme fatale?
By the way, I saw your friend David this evening
Really?
He honored me with a visit at his industrial hideaway
You're kidding
And where's that?
Greenpoint, Brooklyn
How'd you get his number?
I called some of those obscure galleries you prowl...
...dropped your name
You're right
He's very talented
Did you buy anything?
I made him an offer
And?
And he's chewing on it
Good morning
- Hi, it's me
- Hey, how you doing?
- I left my wedding ring
- I know
<i>I put it away before he got here</i>
Thank God!
What did you guys talk about?
He wasn't here that long, so just the work
He didn't have a clue
<i>He said that he made you an offer</i>
Matter of fact, he did
What piece?
It's one you haven't seen
I thought I'd seen all of them
<i>Well, almost</i>
Listen, turns out I got to take a rain check on lunch today
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing
Some people want to see my sketches...
...and it'd be a good commission
You sound funny
Do I?
<i>Yeah</i>
No. I guess it's called being broke, sweetheart
Ok. Tomorrow, then
Reservation for two
Quiet table, in back
Very quiet
You know I love you
I know
- Bye
- Bye
- Is that by...?
- Yeah
People with money always go for the same things, eh?
And what are those?
Anything, everything, as long as it's recognizable
Don't worry. None of this would've been yours anyway
Everything you see here, it's mine
Why don't you drop that there and come here
That's nice
There was a robbery in the building last year
Probable means of entrance...
...was this driveway gate
That granite façade creates a blind spot on the surveillance cameras
It was never corrected, for aesthetic reasons
How do you know that?
I'm on the board
You enter as I leave at 8 p. m.
I won't pull out of the driveway till it's clear
The gate takes 5 seconds to close
Hug the right side of the wall as I drive by
Then you enter the stairs by the service elevator
The key to the front door also works here for the service entrance
I'm going to take the key from Emily's purse before I leave...
...and I'll put it in this...
...and hide it here, right behind the pipe
- Where're you going to be?
- At my regular card game
Why don't you leave me your key?
My key implicates me. Her key implicates no one
It could've been lost or stolen
In any case, she won't be around to explain
Why not make a copy of the key?
It's two loose ends, the key and the locksmith
This door is always bolted
She won't notice, even if she checks it
You'll be in the stairwell at 9:30
By that time, Emily will be taking her bath
She will? How do you know?
Because that's what she does on nights that I play cards
Why not do it in the tub?
Because that'll look like cold-blooded murder
when it has to appear that she surprised the intruder
All right?
This is a separate telephone line
Exactly 10 p. m., I will call here
Emily will answer the phone
You will enter and a...
a tragic confrontation will ensue
It should appear to be...
...stupid...
...and spur-of-the-moment
I've always thought "bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound
Maybe you could use one of these
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom
Disable the service entrance lock
Make it look like it was jimmied
Put the key back under the pipe, then leave the way you came in
And what happens if the plan goes to hell?
It won't
So when is this card game of yours?
- Tomorrow night
- Tomorrow?
No fucking way!
A man with your résumé
should come up with an alibi in no time
100 thousand
A man with my résumé should take the money and run
Bet you 400 thousand more you don't
<i>Yes, I understand that</i>
<i>But if we can't get numbers on refugee density...</i>
<i>...then we can't position the resources to deal with it</i>
<i>Ok. Great. I'll tell her to expect it later today. Thank you</i>
<i>"A tout alheure"</i>
<i>"Bon apetit"</i>
That's not happiness to see me, is it?
Try surprise
I don't expect to have a hole in my schedule...
...and I thought lunch with my beautiful wife would be indicated
But I guess you have other plans
- What makes you say that?
- You seem in such a hurry
No. It's just errands
Like shopping for a new wedding ring
You know? One of the settings felt loose...
...so I took it in. It'll be ready tomorrow
And what if there were no tomorrow?
What does that mean?
Wouldn't you regret not having one last lunch with your husband?
Of course
- Enjoy your meal
- Thank you very much
I must reply to Francesca about this weekend.
- Want to do it?
- Sure
All right, we'll go out...
I got to break this up. Excuse me one minute
<i>Hey, it's David. Leave one. I'll get back to you</i>
<i>David? Are you there?</i>
<i>He was waiting for me...</i>
...to take me to lunch
<i>There was nothing I could do</i>
You know...
I can't do this anymore. I've got to tell him tonight
Hi, I'm here, I'm here
I'm really sorry
It's okay
He's never done that before. Something's wrong. He knows
No, he doesn't
Don't let your mind get away from you
I cannot live like this anymore
It's not right. It's not fair to him. I've got to tell him
Tell him what, exactly?
Tell him everything, tonight
We've waited this long. Hold off another day...
<i>...so we can figure it out together</i>
You know?
So I can help you
- I don't know
- I do
I do know
<i>Honey, don't panic</i>
Good night, Mr. Taylor
I'm on my way
<i>Everything's prepared for you</i>
Give my best to Mrs. Taylor
So how was the rest of your day?
Fairly brutal
I'm sorry to hear about that
I don't want you to go tonight
What's wrong?
I'd like to talk to you
It's too late
They'll never get anybody to fill in
Besides, I beat them last week. They'll want their money back
You scared me
I just wanted to say goodbye
- I'll call you later
- Ok
I might go to Nick's for a burger
If nobody's here, don't worry
I won't, but you might want to reconsider
Why is that?
I had Janice make one of her legendary roasts
Really?
Thought we'd eat before the game
Wish me luck
Good luck
$1,000 to you, George
Fold
- Call
- Down and dirty
Last one, gentlemen
- Got to have more than that
- Three sixes still bets
- Gentlemen, same game
- It's getting a little boring
I'm out
Must be morning in Hong Kong
There's my cards
Let's have a better hand this time
You've got to be kidding me
<i>Mute</i>
Hellow
That's a serious bet
Hellow
Hellow
Who is this?
I'm in
- Put your money up, here we go
- Just in time!
Different winner this time, though, guys
I liked the last one
Oh, my God!
What happened?
<i>Mrs. Taylor, we have your location</i>
He's in the kitchen... he's in the kitchen...
<i>Mrs. Taylor? Please stay on the line</i>
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am?</i>
Oh, Jesus!
Police! Open up!
Open up!
- Mr. Taylor?
- We're all right, we're ok, we're...
He's in the kitchen. I think he's dead. Follow me
You didn't hear any...
...strange sounds...
...prior to your entering the kitchen?
No, just the phone call
But before that, nothing unusual?
- How you guys doing?
- We're pretty set here
I want you to dust the elevator cage...
...and the banister
Mo, be out of here in 15, 20 minutes
Maybe
- Detective Karaman
- Steven Taylor
Pleasure, sir. Mind if I ask you a few questions?
No. Not at all
I noticed what I assume to be your footprints...
...in the blood around the deceased
- Can I assume those are yours?
- Yes, you may
May I ask what you were doing, Mr Taylor?
Making sure he was dead
- Was he?
- Appeared to be, yes
Take his pulse?
No
You see right there?
Did you lean over him for something?
I tried to determine whether he was breathing
- Was he?
- Not at that time
Let's take a look
Something wrong?
Aside from a dead man lying in my kitchen?
For a moment, I thought you knew the man
- I don't think so
- Why's that?
I never forget a face
Anything else?
No
Your wife must come down to give a statement
When?
As soon as she's ready
Mr. Taylor...
...are you aware of anyone who might wish your wife harm?
My wife has no enemies
Thanks, Detective
I know, baby, I know
It's okay
You're going to be all right
What do you think?
I believe her
What about him?
I couldn't say
You know, Mo...
...rich people are different from you and me
How?
They got a fuck of a lot more money, for one thing
Very good, Bobby
Hey, Mo, you going to turn it up, or what?
I like it like this
You had said before...
...that they did not speak
They didn't
They listened
What about background noise? Did you hear anything else...?
There wasn't any. She told you
Maybe you should let your wife answer the questions
I think she's been through enough tonight
We're almost through, Mrs. Taylor
There's just a couple more things I'd like to ask
<i>Remember what time you got home, Mr. Taylor?</i>
11, 11:30. Came from my regular card game at the Drake Club
You'll love this
We've I.D.'d the man who broke into your home
May I?
Sure
This man is a career criminal
You couldn't dream up a better defense for justifiable homicide
Your wife's on three. She says it's an emergency
How old is your boy?
One month
Is he ill?
Colic
May God watch over your son and protect him
And you as well
Well, be glad we cleared that up
I'm going to ask you not to leave the city, Mrs Tylor
But she is
We're going to her mother's house. Roger has the telephone number
Wait. Hold on
Why? She hasn't been charged. Her statement's complete
So it's really just a matter of courtesy
Courtesy on our part
If you think of anything else, you give me a ring
I don't know what else there is to think of
Probably nothing
May you go in safety
And you as well
Thank you
My baby!
I'm just down the hall, baby
Here you go
By tomorrow, this will all seem like a bad dream
And what if there were no tomorrow?
You know better than that
Sleep well
Please tell me
How could something like this happen?
Sandra, I don't know
I've gone over it a thousand times myself
The world's gone crazy
Roger's prepared a statement the D.A.
wants me to sign this evening
So I'll head back into the city and...
...and come back in the morning to pick up Emily...
...if she's all right
<i>David... it's me</i>
I just wanted to tell you I'm okay
<i>I'm not in the city, but I'll call as soon as I can</i>
<i>I love you</i>
I don't want her to be rushed
No, of course not
I don't want her to be rushed either
I'm going to check on our patient
Sorry, David. Emily's resting right now
<i>But I think you and I we've got something to talk about</i>
Who was he?
Somebody I met at Berkeley
Can he be connected to you?
Not anymore
You got any idea who you're fucking with?
Yeah
You hired me to kill your wife...
...because you couldn't do the wet work yourself
Well, neither could I
So how do you know he didn't talk to someone?
Ron was a good man
Not quite good enough
Ok
So what's plan B?
It's a little coincidental if there's another attempt on her life
Gee, you think?
So we wait
For what?
I'll let you know
Hey, Steve...
Do I keep fucking your wife in the meantime, or what?
Thank you, Charles
Steven called while you were asleep
He's getting everything ready for you to come home
He wants to send the car for you tomorrow
I'm not going home
I'm going to move in with Raquel for a while
Em, what's going on?
I'm leaving Steven
They've started liquidating your long positions to cover
Which ones?
DMG and Barclays
Why didn't anybody tell me?
We tried, Steven. We couldn't find you
I said no calls!
- Albert
- Hi
May I please have our house key?
- Sure enough, Mrs. Taylor
- Thank you
What happened to yours?
I've absolutely no idea. It doesn't work
Did my husband change the locks?
No, not that I know of
Emily, it's me
I didn't hear you come in
Because you left the front door wide open
- Emily
- Don't
I'm your husband
Oh, God! I can't stay here
- It's all right. We'll get out of here tonight, all right?
- No
I can't stay with you, Steven
I can't stay with you anymore
Raquel's waiting for me downstairs
Okay, there are fresh towels in the bathroom...
...and you can have anything you want in the fridge...
...including your favourite yogurt
Let me ask you a question
What do you think Steven would do if he knew about David?
Screwing around is the second oldest reason to kill somebody
Really? And what would be the first?
Money, honey
Oh, no but... Steven's already rich...
...and you with your money, you must've had a prenup
Tell me you had a prenup
He offered. I said no
So if you die, he gets, like...
...a hundred million bucks?
Something like that
Lucky guy
Yeah
I assume you have a very good reason for asking me to do this - Yes
We'll sure miss you around here
Come
Come and see me on your way out
- This is Robert Harrington
- How do you do?
Bobby is the Deputy Director of the Commodities Trade Commission
Please
- Take all the time that you need
- Thank you
Mrs. Taylor...
...passing this kind of information, even to a spouse...
...is unethical
I understand
Your husband has been buying U.S. and foreign bonds on margin...
...and using those securities as collateral
That's illegal
In fact, his company's been under investigation for almost a year
Some months ago...
...U.S. interest rates started moving against him
He should've gotten some horrific margin calls...
...but the banks he's in bed with have hidden the losses...
...hoping that things will turn around
It isn't happening
Sooner or later...
...those margin calls will come
And when they do, your husband will be...
...wiped out
Yep, where's the subpoena?
But I can't get the records without it
- I've waited two days
- Mo
Just get back to me
Detective...
- Please sit down
- Thank you
To what do I owe the pleasure, Mrs. Taylor?
I have some information about my husband
Concerning?
It seems he's in serious financial trouble...
...and he was hiding it from me
And I thought that...
...might be a possible reason...
...a possible reason for him to...
Hire someone to kill you?
Yes
I know what you're worth, Mrs. Taylor...
...and that kind of money is always a motive
Do you mean he's already a suspect?
Was
Until we traced a phone call he made the night you were attacked
The trace led us to an automated quote system at his office
It lasted from five minutes before ten to nine minutes after
That has to be one of the cleaner alibis I've come across
I took your case apart a thousand times...
...then I put it back together again
There was always one piece left...
...like a screw that didn't fit
The dead man had a wallet, cash and change, driver's license...
...membership card to a video store, but...
...not a single key
Not one
Not even to his apartment
Elliot, it's a zero-sum game. You don't have the balls for it
<i>Tylor, by tomorrow, neither of us will have any balls left</i>
- Don't panic
- You're damn right I am
You drop 50 million in a day
<i>You know how fast 50 becomes 500?</i>
Not now. What's the spot rate?
<i>We're sitting at ground zero</i>
<i>You're telling me, "Think happy thoughts"?</i>
I said, not now!
<i>I'm sorry, but I have a caller who says this is an emergency</i>
<i>He says it concerns Emily</i>
- Who is it?
- He won't identify himself
<i>Who is this?</i>
<i>A tragic confrontation will ensue</i>
<i>It should appear to be...</i>
<i>...stupid and...</i>
<i>...spur-of-the-moment.</i>
<i>I've always thought that "bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound</i>
<i>Maybe you could use one of these here</i>
Meet me at the diner at the corner of Maiden and South
Right now
He was a con named Ronald Diggs
Fresh from state prison in California
Must be hard for you
Mr. Taylor
You didn't get those fancy shoes dirty walking over here, did you?
What do you want?
The rest of my money
You didn't fulfill your end of the bargain, did you?
So?
So what do I get?
You get this superfine thing
Hell, you might even call it...
What was that?
"Legitimately sublime"
What exactly is this superfine thing?
You're looking at it
It's called time outside of prison, old partner
You can't beat it with a stick
Exactly how much time does $400,000 buy me?
Whatever the market will bear
It'll take me a few days
You got four hours
That's impossible and you know it
Come on, Steve
A man with your résumé should come up with 400 grand in no time
Where?
My place
You don't show up with the cash...
...I'll do a mailing of Steven's greatest hits
I understand
Make fucking sure you do
Hey, Blondie!
What are you doing here?
Excuse me
I'm looking for apartment 209
This way?
Thank you
There's a blonde coming up
Leave her alone
A blonde?
Send her right up!
That's not happiness to see me, is it?
Try surprise
The key to the dead man's apartment was on my key chain
Someone put it there after I killed him
And theres only one person in the world could've done that
Me
Why?
To protect you
From what?
Your lover
Unless somebody else sent these pictures
Oh, my God
Amazing how you know people are in love
even across the street
He called me here two months ago...
...bragged about how you'd fallen for him
I've shelled out over $100,000 already...
...but he wants a lot more
For what?
For breaking it off
I don't believe you
Did he mention Belize?
That's where he took all the other ones
This guy was quite an aphrodisiac for lonely women of means
He learned to paint at the State prison... not at Berkeley

<i><b>CRIMINAL HISTORY</b></i>
I don't know where we go from here, Emily
I don't even know if "we" is an option
I have done everything in my power to protect you from this...
...career criminal that you've let crawl into our bed
Why didn't you tell me?
I was sure you were in love with him
Are you?
I thought that I was
Oh, my God. I can only imagine what I've put you through
Is this why your business is in trouble?
Trouble?
The banks, margin calls
How did you know...? It hasn't helped, no
- But it's true, isn't it?
- Yes, it's true
But I can always make money
There's a goddamn sea of it out there
But there's only one of you
But why did you put his key on my key chain?
David threatened violence from the very beginning
When I saw the body lying in the kitchen, I was sure it was him
No doors had been forced open, so I assumed that he had your key
But when? I had just used it to come home that evening
Are you sure you used your key? If memory serves me...
...the door was wide open. I saw you walk in
Maybe
In which case, he could've taken your key anytime...
...even the day before. Did you see him the day before?
Yes
I searched his pockets, I found what I thought was your key...
...and I reacted. I grabbed a screwdriver, I jimmied the door
I put it in his pocket, took what I thought was your key...
...and put it on your key chain
Baby, I am so sorry for having to put you through this
It was the only thing I could do
Can you ever forgive me?
Honey, I already have
We have to go to the police
I don't know if this is the time for brutal honesty
I mean... I've tampered with evidence... in a homicide
I paid off a blackmail. I'm in over my head and so are you
Think it through! David could say anything he wants
He could say that I hired him to kill you
Or that he blackmailed us, the happy, wealthy couple
It'd appear we killed that poor bastard, thinking it was David
It depends on how he plays it
What about the man that I killed?
That has to do with David?
Well, it must!
Emily, do you have any idea how many burglaries there are each day?
I don't think so
What are we going to do now?
We'll have to disentangle ourselves from your artist friend
Is there anything in his loft that could link David to you and I?
My ring
You said it was being repaired
That was a lie. I left it by the bed
Anything else?
Isn't that enough?
I'll get it
Will you be home when I get back?
Yes
I'm on my way
<i>I'm calling for Mr. Shaw, Mr David Shaw?</i>
Speaking
<i>It's Truman Travel, confirming your reservation for this afternoon</i>
Thank you
Excuse me, sir
Could you spare 400 grand?
I don't see why not
Don't think I won't count it
Naturally
Think of that as your commemorative copy
Nice doing business with you, Steve
You take care
<i>Last call: boarding train number 32 for Montreal...</i>
<i>...departing on track number 16. All aboard, please</i>
Right this way
- Here we are, sir
- Ok
Thank you, sir
Just wanted to let you know the dining car opens at 7
- Closes at 10 sharp
- Ok
Okay, everything's fine
<i>Attention, please</i>
<i>Last call for train 32 departing to Montreal in 4 minutes</i>
How's that for wet work?
You should thank me
Artists are always appreciated more after they're dead
You lose
I'm sorry, you got to speak up. I can't hear you
You're dying
Steven's... greatest hits
Excuse me. I got an emergency here
What are you doing?
- This'll make it easier, all right?
- Be my guest!
91st and Fifth
Has there been a delivery today?
Just one. It came by messenger, but your wife took it up with the mail
- I didn't know you were here
- I was out on the terrace
Welcome home
It's time for a new start
What do you say we go out for dinner this evening?
Just the two of us, someplace quiet...
...in the neighborhood
- Like that?
- Good
I'll be right back. I'm going to clean up
- Honey?
- Yeah
What doy you think if we stay home tonight?
I'll go pick up something to eat
That's sweet of you. Yeah. Just don't be too long.
- I won't
- Ok
Before I forget, I think we should have the locks changed
Why?
Because I still can't find my key
Good idea. I'll call the locksmith in the morning
- Better be safe than sorry
- Thanks
See you soon. Hurry back
Must have put it back on his way in
Didn't plan on that, did you?
Young David he was...
...he was very unpredictable
Maybe you'll share a cell
Why?
Because of this?
I just found the key you lost
You left it for him
You mean the man you killed?
- Sorry. I never met the gentleman
- David did
They'll have a hard time proving I knew David
The blackmail proves it
What blackmail?
There's only one letter...
...and I'm afraid that's vanished
The thing is Emily, we're just another married couple...
...trying to work things out
Work it out?
Work it out?
<i>Because that's what she does on nights that I play cards</i>
Like the combination to the safe?
It's our wedding day, Steven
You work it out on your fucking own! This is over!
I'll tell you when it's over
The only way you leave me is dead
<i>I always thought that "bludgeon" had a spur-of-the-moment sound</i>
<i>Maybe you could use one of these here</i>
<i>Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom</i>
<i>Disable the service entrance lock</i>
<i>Make it look like it was jimmied</i>
<i>Put the key back under the pipe...</i>
<i>...then leave the same way you came in</i>
<i>And what happens if the plan goes to hell?</i>
<i>It won't</i>
He said he was going to kill me
So I tried to run
And then he attacked you?
Yes
What else could you do?
May God be with you
And you as well
