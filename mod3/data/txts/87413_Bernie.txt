I'm very honored
to introduce
our guest lecturer today.
He graduated from here
about 15 years ago.
He's gone on
to a fabulous career.
I can't think of a single person
who's more qualified
or more adept
at the final procedures
you've been
studying lately.
Now you've
learned the science,
now's your chance
to learn the art.
Students, Mr. Bernie Tiede.
Thank you, Professor.
Thank you.
It's always an honor
to be asked back
and I do it gladly
because I feel--
if even one thing I say
or demonstrate today
helps you in any way as you
embark on your careers,
then everyone
will have benefited.
You, those
who are grieving,
and the deceased.
The nails have to be clipped,
shaped and brought
back to life.
And you must cast
the nails to the person.
You wouldn't
want a mechanic
to have the nails
of a flight attendant.
Would you?
It is very important to remove
any unwanted nasal,
ear, or facial hair.
We can never be too vigilant
in the lookout for that
one stray rogue hair.
The eyes are often
a minor problem
because they usually
want to stay open.
It's almost like they want one last
look at this miraculous world.
But with some Super Glue--
a little dab will do you--
and it's no more peeking.
Even though the features have
been set during the embalming,
you have to reassess
and readjust
because of continuing
emaciation and dehydration.
Perfect expression
of the mouth
would be relaxed, natural,
with a little bit of a smile.
Can't have him looking
unhappy to be there.
And we must always be on guard
for the mischievous lip drift.
Even the slightest hint of
teeth can be disastrous.
You cannot have grief
tragically become a comedy.
Then, after a foundation
mixed with massage cream
to prevent dehydration,
even out coloration,
then apply highlights.
Do not over-cosmetize.
Most of those who service the
deceased apply far too much blush.
Just a note
to always remember:
too much color does not
make one look more alive.
The last detail
to be managed
is the deceased's
body position.
Left hand over the right,
over the umbilicus,
in an attitude of ease,
of repose, of retirement.
The position of the head
is oh so important.
Neither star gazing
nor navel gazing,
but perfectly centered,
turned ever so slightly
to the right--
in greeting.
He's now been cosmetized,
he's ready to be dressed,
and casketed.
# Love lifted me! #
# Love lifted me! #
# Looove lifted meee! #
# I was sinking
Deep in sin #
# Off on the peaceful shore #
# Buried deeply
Staying within #
# Sinking to rise no more #
# But the master
Of the sea #
# Heard my despairing cry #
Bernie was a very
charismatic man.
A loving person.
And he had the ability to
make the world seem kind.
# Love looked at me #
# When nothing else
Could help #
# Love lifted me #
# Love lifted me #
Real good with people,
a real people person,
always had his hand out,
ready to shake it,
never met a stranger,
good with names,
good with questions.
He could remember if your
daughter was at Texas,
and your son
was at A&M.
He'd remember that and he'd ask
you questions about those kids.
Just made you feel real
good about yourself.
# When nothing else
could help now #
# Love lifted me #
# Souls in danger
Look above #
# Jesus completely saves #
# He will lift you
By his love #
# Out of the angry ways #
# He's the master of the sea #
If the people in Carthage were
to make a list of those people
that they thought
would get to heaven,
I am sure that Bernie would be
right at the top of the list.
# Love lifted me #
# When nothing
Else could help #
# Now love lifted me #
His personality was,
just, like, magnetic, okay?
So people were drawn
to him all the time.
And because of that,
that personality,
before too long, he was the
most popular man in Carthage.
# Love lifted me
Love lifted me #
# Looove lifted meee #
Carthage is in east Texas.
And it's totally different
from the rest of Texas,
which could be five different
states, actually.
You got your west Texas out there
with a bunch of flat ranches.
Up north, you got them Dallas
snobs with their Mercedes,
and then you got Houston,
the carcinogenic coast
all the way up to Louisiana.
Then down south,
San Antonio, uh,
that's where the Tex
meets the Mex.
Like the food.
And then in central Texas,
you got the People's
Republic of Austin
with a bunch of hairy-legged
women and liberal fruitcakes.
Of course, I left out the panhandle,
and a lot of people do, but--
Carthage--this is
where the south begins.
This is life
behind the pine curtain.
And, and, and truth be known,
it's a good place.
Carthage has such
a good reputation
that it's listed in The Best Small Towns
of America, Volume Two
as the best small
town in Texas.
That's right.
Page 157.
Oh, hell, most people live in Carthage
because they were born here.
Carthage sits on what was once one
of the biggest gas fields in the world.
Back in the gas
boom of the 40s and 50s,
a lot of people
got rich around here.
Well, as I recall,
we were gonna get a lot
of the older people in town
leaving for the sweet hereafter,
and we got a little
backed up in the cold room,
um--frankly, I was
looking for some help.
Bernie must've seen
an ad or something.
He called from Louisiana and I
hired him over the phone,
not fully knowing
what to expect.
These are our viewing rooms.
Oh, look at that, you've
got these partitions.
That's so nice.
So, you got your associate's degree in
Mortuary Science at State?
Yes, sir.
Play any ball over there?
Uh, no no, sir.
I wanted to concentrate
on my studies,
as much as I loved football
and whatnot.
Now here's our sanctuary.
It'll seat one twenty five.
Look at these green benches.
I love them.
Yeah, we changed those.
We had them normal
brown for so long
and I was a little worried about
this green. I don't know.
People don't complain.
I--I don't either,
I think they're great.
Oh, I hit the jackpot with
that guy.
He's the most qualified young
man I ever met.
He was excellent at removals,
an artist in the embalming room,
could fix hair like nobody in
the business.
Waited well on the families
in the morning parlor,
could sing like a bird.
He ran a funeral
like a professional,
any aspect of
the funeral business:
eulogizing, scripture reading,
singing--man,
he could do it.
But most of all,
we're gonna remember
Fred as our friend.
Our--really--close--friend.
# Amazing grace #
# How sweet the sound #
# That saved a wretch #
# Like me #
I'll walk you
to your car.
You poor thing.
This is so hard.
It's just so hard.
You're very brave.
Here now.
Oh, honey,
he was a magician.
He made all of us
just look beautiful.
I mean, he could make your
wrinkles all just go away,
and he would, if, if you had
a overbite,
he'd fix it so it wouldn't be
so sticky outie.
And he would, um-- take
a bouquet of small white roses
and put it in your hand.
I mean, he just made everybody
look so beautiful.
Except too bad
you were dead.
It seemed like no matter
what happened to us,
whether it was car wrecks
or heart attacks
or household poisons, or guns left
locked and loaded around the house,
or choking on a little
piece of meat,
in the end, he always
made us look good.
Oh, you name the song,
he'd sing it.
If country folks came in requesting
an old gospel, he'd sing it.
Or trailer trash came in requesting
Loretta Lynn,
he'd sing that, too.
But as great as Bernie
was at performing a service,
he was even better at sales.
If you pardon my reach,
Mrs. Thompson,
this is a memory drawer.
It wasn't bullshit,
he really believed
that all those little touches
were necessary.
He even came
up with this idea:
for 150 extra--
"Oh, that I had
wings like a dove,
I would fly away
and be at rest."
At this moment, as the casket
descends into the ground,
we now release a white dove
symbolizing Mr. Callahan's soul--
passing on
to the next world,
to the mystery
of the great beyond.
Yes, I agree,
that is a lot of money
to put down in advance.
But there's a right way and
a wrong way to approach this.
It was his idea to put up more
crosses on the wall
and change the lighting,
make it feel more like a church
or a sacred place,
less like a business
or an office.
Were you thinking
interment or cremation?
I beg your pardon?
He means buried or burned.
Buried. We already
have the plots.
I am so happy for you.
Can I tell you, I am not fond
of cremations.
I just don't like the idea
of someone spending eternity
in something the size
of a motel ice bucket.
I'd just soon drop
you in a ditch
by the side of the road.
Hey.
I want to keep it simple.
Yeah, this is--this is fine.
- I see.
- Yeah.
Now, these composite wood with
cloth we sell mostly to the county
to bury the unclaimed,
the indigent,
and also no
warranty, of course.
Warranty?
Oh, with
our better caskets,
we, uh, guarantee
that your remains
will be untouched by rainwater,
pesky insects,
burrowing animals
searching for food--
Also, now tall
are you, Mr. Eccles?
About 6'2".
Oh, dear.
These economy boxes
are not very large.
We may have to make a leg
adjustment to get a proper fit.
Leg adjustment?
Well, not necessarily break
the legs but definitely
- bend the feet--
- No! No,
I--I won't have it.
Then may I suggest--
the Corinthian.
# Just as I am #
# Without one #
I'm pretty sure the first
time Bernie met Mrs. Nugent
was at the time
of Mr. Nugent's funeral.
# Was shared for me #
# And that thou be come #
Her husband, Dwayne,
he was just a tough
old typical old man.
And he liked to do business
just a handshake,
He would say things like--
I'll guaran-damn-tee yah--
He was some kind of exploration guy
with a big oil company
and he made a whole lot of money
back in the 60s.
He was too tight
to spend any of it
but he liked to invest his money
in everything he could.
# To thee who's blood
can cleanse #
# Each spot o' land #
As a matter of fact,
he even bought a bank here in town.
I believe it was '87,
he bought the bank.
He run that sucker
with a hard fist.
Just, I mean,
he was kinda--
abrupt, and the way--
I appreciate it.
the way he done
business and stuff.
Of course, then after he died, well,
then she took over
and she started having
a position that he had
and if it was said
that he was kinda
disliked in the way
he did business,
you'd have to say that
she was literally hated,
'cause that old heifer,
she turned down
loans just for a hobby.
She was just a mean
old hateful bitch.
Hey. There's just no
other way to put it.
She wasn't friendly.
She--she really wasn't,
and she probably-- there are people
in town, honey,
that woulda shot her
for five dollars, ya know?
I mean, when you live
in a small town,
you've got to be friendly
and nice to folks.
She would chew your ass
at the drop of a hat.
I mean, she'd rip
you a brand new
three bedroom two bath double
wide asshole. No problem.
In the fourteenth chapter
of the book of John,
Jesus said, "Let not
your heart be troubled."
Well, I heard that
she hadn't talked
to her sisters
in over 20 years
but when the mother died,
she was right in
there fightin' them
over quilts and chairs.
Can you believe that?
And one of the sisters even wanted
to donate land to the church,
but she interfered
because she didn't want
the church to have it.
She didn't like that pastor.
He wore Bermuda shorts
on his day off.
Friends and loved ones--
Everybody in town
knew that Mr. and Mrs. Nugent
weren't exactly friends
with their son Dwayne Junior
and his family.
He was a doctor out in Middleton,
almost never came to visit.
One of his daughters had actually
sued her grandparents
trying to get at
the money in that trust.
That made her so mad she never
spoke to any of them again.
Let us pray.
Marjorie Nugent.
She was--
not a very nice lady
and her nose was so high
she'd drown
in a rainstorm.
Mrs. Margy, she was
the kind of person
that I believe
she was born old.
She was just born
with this prune face.
That's pretty much the impression
people got from her.
I got a buddy
of mine, Louie.
He's a decent fellow
I work for.
Mrs. Nugent took a broom
to his ass one day.
Would you like me to get up
and do the back in there?
- Get out.
- Ooh.
Oh.
- Beautiful service.
- Thank you.
- I'll see you on Sunday.
- Thank you very much.
He was great
with the D-L-O-Ls.
That's what we all called
the "dear little old ladies. "
All the widows in town
had crushes on Bernie.
Just thought
I'd bring you a hankie.
Oh, yeah, old Bernie.
H e loved to hug and
kiss on those older women.
At his age now, they were lucky to get
the time of day from him.
Hi.
Hi, Mrs. Nugent,
I just, uh--
wanted you to know
I was thinking about you.
- These times can be hard.
- Oh, thank you.
Okay.
I never asked him
to do this and
he wasn't getting
paid to do it,
but he would always stop by
and check on the widows
after he'd done
their husbands' funerals.
He just really
cared about them.
I mean, that guy was
just a sweet guy,
and they just
loved him to death.
Room service.
Hi, I'm just dropping
by again, Mrs. Nugent,
to pay my respects.
I brought you some soaps
and a little bubble bath
to soothe you in the tub,
and some chocolate cupcakes
for a late night snack.
Come in.
Oh! That--would be
my pleasure.
In high school I wanted
to be an evangelist
to save the souls
of my fellow students.
A lot of them were starting
to drink and smoke
and ride motorcycles
and have premarital sexual
experiences and all that.
- Oh, yes please!
- Here you go, Bernie.
Thank you, Esmeralda.
When.
Miss Marjorie?
One time I got
four teenagers
to re-dedicate
their lives to Jesus,
but eventually I realized I was meant
for other equally important things.
Oh, please, Bernie,
touching all those
cold bloated bodies. Please!
Don't you think you were meant to do
something more?
No, no, no, no,
Mrs. Nugent.
It isn't bad at all.
Their souls are already with the Lord
by the time I'm involved.
It's just my
way to serve
and show respect
for the lives they led
and comfort all
the loved ones
that they
leave behind.
Well.
And some day, if I'm lucky,
many many years from now,
I will give you such
a beautiful funeral--
with all the roses
in East Texas.
I know it'll be the event
of the season in Carthage.
You know, I think
that Bernie was the one
that got Marjorie back to church
after her husband died.
Well, I know
the Bible says
Jesus turned
water into wine,
but it didn't say
liquor store wine.
It had to have been
non-alcoholic wine,
because it didn't
have time to ferment.
If Jesus could
walk on the water,
he could make any kind
of wine he wanted to.
Fermented or not.
Right on the spot.
Morning, ladies.
Sorry to interrupt.
Mrs. Marjorie, it is so good to
have you with us this morning.
I just want to put
a bug in your ear now.
Many of you know we're hoping to
start construction
on our new prayer wing soon.
Mmm.
Well, I'm hoping I
can count on a few of you
to join the fundraising
committee. Okay?
Think about it, now.
God bless you.
# This is my story

# Perfect submission

Uh-uh, no,
we'll take my car.
No, I insist.
Don't be silly, Bernie.
Good, I'll see you
Saturday afternoon.
I'm--I'm looking
forward to it, too.
Okay, Mrs. Nugent, bye.
Oh, so sweet.
That was Bernie Tiede, the
assistant funeral director.
He's very sweet
and very nice to me.
Can't think of anyone who's been
that nice to me in 50 years.
Now, you!
You've got two minutes
to explain these accounts to me.
Or three minutes from now
I just might get myself
another stockbroker.
I can explain everything,
Miss Marjorie.
It's a very simple case of them
changing their accounting statements.
They changed their formatting,
it's re-formatted--
in a different format.
Hey, listen.
I couldn't help but hear
the end of that conversation.
I gotta tell you, Bernie,
you have got to be about the bravest
man in this town.
She isn't all that mean
like everyone says.
Now you sure about that?
Well, she doesn't
have anyone, Don.
She's a very lonely person.
She needs someone.
I've asked her to accompany me
this Saturday
to the Van Clyburn Piano Competition
in Fort Worth.
Well, have fun.
Ain't like she's the richest
widow in town.
Hell, maybe she'll
even pay for everything.
- Don!
- Hey--
And if she does offer
to pay for everything,
order up a couple of them
bottles of Dom Perignon.
You get her
liquored up,
you might get lucky.
No, Don!
He sincerely believed that--
it was better to give
than to receive.
Well, Bernie had
a problem with money.
He was generous. Some folks say
overly generous.
What he was
was a buy-aholic.
And, uh--hell, he'd
walk into a store,
seen something he liked,
he'd buy the store
out of every goddamn
item he wanted
and give the shit away.
And that's crazy.
But that Bernie, he liked to make
people smile.
He wanted friends.
Acceptance, I guess,
is what you call it.
And Bernie could do
just about anything.
I mean, he could hang wallpaper
in people's houses,
and I've never seen
any man do this,
but he could make
curtains for people
and he was
the head honcho
for the Chamber of Commerce
Christmas
decorating committee.
That's a big thing
in Carthage, too, a big thing.
Bernie was really smart.
H e helped people do
their tax returns, you know,
financial counseling--
Anything that you
pay for on the job
that the company,
the oil company
doesn't reimburse you for,
that's a tax deduction.
So, for instance, Toby,
these work coveralls,
did the company
provide you with these?
No, we got to buy our own.
Bingo. That is a tax deduction.
And how about
your lunch buckets
and your steel toe workboots,
they give you those?
- Why, hell no.
- That's what I thought.
- You kidding me?
- Uh-uh.
That's tax deduction
number two and three.
Thank you, Sheriff Huckabee.
You're listening to KGAS,
the heartbeat of East Texas.
Now before we get to the school
cafeteria menu,
and the wedding anniversaries
for the week,
here's Bernie Tiede
from Leggett Funeral Home.
Thank you, Jerry.
As some of you
are already aware,
Mr. Harvey Gunnolds
left this world all too soon
this past Wednesday after a
brief hospital stay.
I used to love having
him on the air.
I mean, every Friday people would
tune in just to hear Bernie.
And when he
did the obituaries,
it wasn't like a so-and-so was survived
by so-and-so kind of thing.
It was--let's see
if I can remember--
Left in sorrow to mourn the passing
of the beloved Mr. Gunnolds
are Mima Gunnolds,
his mother, Georgia--
And the way he would make
them "look good" in death,
well, he'd make
them sound good, too.
Like Gunnolds was a drunk,
always startin' shit
wherever he went.
He finally got himself
killed in a pool hall.
Now how do you say something
nice about somebody like that?
Well, to Bernie,
it was, "He was known--"
--for his social
engagements and his--
conversational abilities--
A kid would wrap
his car around a tree
and with Bernie
it was--
--and yet, death slipped
up on young Mr. Shotwell,
as gentle
as a fallen mist.
What happened?
I regret to inform you
that four of your classmates
have just been killed.
Now this is gonna
happen to you
if you drink and drive.
Is this what you want
to happen to you?
It didn't make no
difference what it was
or who ask it, if it was
good for the community,
Bernie'd give it all he had.
All the time.
He was very serious about
his commitment to Carthage.
Life is so beautiful,
every moment a miracle,
and yet in a blink it's gone.
Too young.
Too young!
Oh, he really had a way of bringing
the community together.
Not just at the funerals
and at the church,
he organized
a "Beautify Carthage" campaign,
and he put on the very first
East Texas art festival
and invited artists from
all around the region
to display their works.
Are these all--?
I'm sorry to stop you,
are these all done with that--
the, uh, what's
that called?
It's all chain saw.
How do you do that?
I wake up in the morning
with an idea
and cut away everything
that ain't that idea.
Can I talk to you
at some time?
- Do you have a card?
- Yeah.
Because I have an idea I would
love to commission.
I don't know if you
work that way, but--
Look at that card, he
put it on a piece of wood.
- I'm gonna call you.
- Alright.
- You're a gem.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Oh, yeah, Bernie
took her everywhere.
He took her to the
Van Clyburn Competition,
took her up to
the junior college
to see some of
the rehearsals of shows
that he was working on.
Oh, yeah, he always
had Mrs. Nugent.
# I've never
Been in love before #
# Now all at once it's you #
# It's you forever more #
# I've never been
In love before #
# I thought my
Heart was safe #
He had come to a production
in a local theater,
and he thought
it could be better
so he volunteered
to help out
and pretty soon he was the musical
director for one show,
a director in another one,
and an actor in almost
all of them.
He just had a real
knack for drama.
# Please forgive this
Helpless haze I'm in #
# I've really never been #
# In love before #
# I've never been
In love before #
# Now all I want to be #
I saw them at
a restaurant one time.
They was out to lunch together,
and he reached over and kissed her on the cheek.
But it wasn't a kiss like you give
your momma or your grandma.
It was more of a romantic,
sexual kiss to me, you know?
He had that graoning sound
in the back of his voice.
It was kinda strange.
It just didn't
look right to me.
The word was it wasn't a week
after the funeral
Mrs. Nugent gave Bernie Mr. Nugent's
$12,000 Rolex watch.
Hell, for that kinda money,
I bet he did kiss her.
In a small town,
people will always
suspect the worst of someone.
But they'll also
suspect the best.
So we just thought
they were companions.
Look, it was widely assumed
that Mrs. Nugent
was paying Bernie
to "accompany her" places.
Oh, I'd
estimate they spent
nearly a hundred thousand a year
on vacations.
They went to Russia,
Acapulco, New York City.
They went to Europe
on the Queen Mary,
always first class,
always some spa,
some resort,
some--sittin' in some
hot spring mineral
peeling water bath.
Margy looked
so much better.
You see pictures of her on
these trips with Bernie.
She had nice hair,
she looked good,
she seemed happy,
and she had Bernie
to thank for that.
Marjorie realized she had
everything in front of her.
She could do anything she wanted
in her life,
and she wanted to travel.
Money was no object
but unfortunately,
she had no friends or family
that she wanted
to travel with.
Until she met Bernie.
Hey, I'll tell you
one thing for sure.
On that trip to Belize,
they stayed in the same room.
And you know
damn right well
they saw each other
in their underwear.
And I know for sure
that when she
went to Shreveport,
to get some sexy lingerie
at Doris' lingerie shop,
she got herself
a see through nightgown
that showed her breasts.
I mean, give me a break.
What is a woman her age
wanting to do
showing her boobs?
Seriously.
Disgusting.
Bernie was
a little effeminate.
I mean, an unmarried
man in his late 30s,
going to all the musicals
with a bunch of old blue-hairs--
Ah! You know, I heard
that he was gay,
but he was such
a good Christian man,
everybody thought, you know,
how could that be?
That dog don't hunt.
Nah.
There was always talk
about Bernie being
a little light
in the loafers but--
I always thought
he was celibate.
He was a nice-looking man and there
were lots of girls in the community
who would've loved to have
a date with him,
but he never seemed to show
much interest in that.
He stayed busy all the time
and was working.
He had a tendency
to hold on
to another man's hands, touched too long
after shaking it,
and he had a subscription
to men's fitness magazine.
Now if you've ever seen Bernie Tedie,
you know darn well
it wasn't for the workout tips.
And when you
see him around town,
if he wasn't at the church
or at work in the funeral home,
he would always be where we these
doggone hemmed, starched shorts.
With his belt line--
above the navel.
And the kicker is
he always wore sandals.
Our Lord and Savior
always wore sandals
and he never married.
And he had 12 disciples
and I don't think
any of them ever married.
And the apostle Paul,
he was a lifelong bachelor.
And you never heard anybody
in the New Testament
say that they was
a bunch of queers.
No.
No, he had homosexual relations.
I know that for a fact.
This ain't San Francisco,
so around here we got a
lot of "closet homosexuals."
And I know of at least two men
that he had relationships with
that were heterosexual.
Were.
Now one of the main things
and why I have this job,
and why I feel like
I'm good at it is,
you see, I'm
naturally suspicious.
Sometimes I find myself waking up
in the middle of the night.
I'll be staring off
out through the backyard
into the woods and I--
I'll be thinking about all
the crime and mayhem
happening out there,
and that's--that's when I start
putting it together in my mind.
I stop the criminal.
I wait, I watch,
and I listen.
When the time's just right--
that's when I pounce.
Ain't nothing I enjoy more
than the sound of a criminal
that's just wriggling
on the end of my
hook, hey, you know,
and folks like to see
the D.A. at work.
But no county
ain't gonna hire a D.A.
who doesn't know that this is
a full time job.
All the time.
One thing Danny
Bucks is good at
is getting Danny
Buck re-elected.
And he gets his little photo ops
in the paper,
busting up the copper rings
or the hub-cap rings,
or the meth labs,
but in slow times,
Danny Buck be out
digging up some shit.
Let me show
y'all something.
You're gonna love this.
I call this
my wheel of misfortune.
Now what I've done is,
I've assigned numbers
to all the suspected
drug dealers around here.
If your number comes up,
number eight, Danny
Buck's come to get you first.
And not one of you dope pushers
is gonna get away.
Not one.
The best trick I ever pulled
is the time I arrested
five deadbeat dads
all at the same time.
You see, I was having
trouble finding them.
Actually, what I did
is I used the annual
hands on a hardbody contest
the one at the Dodge
dealership on 79?
People were standing around
for days and days
with their hands
on the pick up truck,
and the last one with
their hand on the truck wins it.
What I did, is I got a rig
where they invited these five dads who
aren't paying child support.
I figured the idea
of a new truck
might get'em to come
out of hiding.
Did it work?
You bet your butt it did.
Hey, get him!
I think we'd like to move
some out of financials
and into technologies,
maybe a little more Apple.
And we'd like to get a thousand
shares of Tommy Hilfiger.
I got a sneak-a-peek
at the new line for the--
What is this "we'd
like to" part, Bernie?
What do you know about stocks
and investing?
Let me remind you:
you bury people.
You're a mortician. You're
not an investment advisor.
No one uses the word
"mortician" anymore, Lloyd.
It's "funeral director."
Or in your case
assistant funeral director.
We just thought you were being a little
conservative with Marjorie's account.
Hello? Lloyd?
He hung up.
Whoa.
No.
Something crawled
up his butt.
This is Lloyd.
Lloyd! Don't you ever, ever speak to Bernie
like that again,
or I'll be moving my account.
I'm sorry, I got a little
frustrated and I--
Don't be sorry,
just don't do it.
Well.
I have a son and
four grandchildren
some of whom have
threatened to sue me
and have actually sued me
and none of them visit or appear
to care about me.
Also my son is a physician
and amply provides
for his family.
For the reasons stated,
I am not including them
as beneficiaries under my will.
I give, devise and bequeath
my entire estate,
real, personal and mixed,
onto Bernhardt Tiede the Second,
outright and simple.
To life.
Oh, thank you, Crystal.
Here you go.
Cheers.
Give pills, give
me my pills, Bernie.
Pardon me?
You know I have to take my pills
before eating.
You were supposed
to bring them,
so where are they?
Give them to me.
I'm sorry, Marjorie, there must have been
a little misunderstanding.
I'd be happy to go to
your room and get them.
Excellent!
Okay.
Okay.
She put his name
on all her bank accounts,
and then she gave him
a power of attorney,
which meant he could spend her
money any way he wanted to.
And he did.
Been on the line for a while.
Won't let go.
Hello, Marjorie, I--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I thought I told you
what I was doing
this morning.
Well, I don't
have my phone on
while I am up there.
You know that.
I'm sure we won't be late
for lunch,
but I'm on my way.
Okay. Bye-bye.
- This is my life.
- Okay.
Somewhere along the way,
Mrs. Nugent convinced Bernie to go
to part time at the funeral home
and go working
full-time for her.
She got rid
of all the usual help
and it was just Bernie.
He was her business manager,
travel companion,
her servant.
Bernie! You should've
been here hours ago!
But we still have time.
We'll be there on time, Marjorie.
I need you to go by the cleaners and
pick up my dress.
Now I've got
to wear something else.
You fooling around with those damn
planes all the time, Bernie.
I told you I
was going to be--
Okay, you told me.
What good does that do me?
Things change
and I needed you here.
And because you never leave your
cell phone on all the time,
this is a pager.
You're going to wear it on your
person at all times, correct?
- Correct.
- Go get me a dress.
- Okay.
- Hurry. Hurry.
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry, hurry.
Ugh.
Marjorie, please.
I can understand chewing
each bite of some food
25 times like
chicken fried steak,
but I don't think
you have to chew
your refried beans
that many times.
It doesn't
really make sense.
It's unnecessary additional work
for your jaws.
Think of your
poor TMJ muscle.
It can't be good for it.
It's inefficient.
Think about it.
You this drives me crazy.
Please stop.
This is like nails
on a chalkboard.
Okay, go ahead, chew like that,
chew like that all day.
Ah!
Well, Bernie was so nice,
so accommodating,
so willing to keep from hurting
other people's feelings,
he just couldn't tell
anybody to piss off.
Bernie, I'm still waiting.
Would you rather hear
"Drama in Real Life? "
"Tips for Better
Summer T omatoes" or--
Tips for Better
Summer Tomatoes.
"The best summer tomatoes--
She was demanding,
condescending,
even conniving.
And she had intentionally put him
in a dependent position.
She was jealous of his time,
envious of his
community status,
and--overly generous to him.
So as to make him
stick around.
So you just show
people around the boat?
All around the boat?
Yeah, I give tours.
And I bartend
in the captain's cabin.
- Oh, you have a lot of jobs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're a jack
of all trades.
It's good though.
The money's good.
Not bad. And you get to see
the world, right?
- Yeah, we do.
- That's cool.
- Yeah.
- Marjorie?
This is Kevin
who works here.
Hello, Mrs. Nugent.
Bernie, we're scheduled
to be there now.
- I'm ready. Okay.
- Be still.
Okay. Do you want
me to get this?
- Stop asking questions.
- Okay, you got it.
- Thank you.
- Good, good.
- Let's go.
- Thank you.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- Nice talking to you.
- See you, Bernie.
- Yeah. Okay, bye-bye.
Okay, you want to look
right down the lens
and say "Egypt. "
Egypt.
Okay.
Okay, everybody, let's work on the arrival
of the Wells Fargo Wagon.
This wagon has all
of our instruments on it
so we're very
excited about it--
Uh-oh, hold on.
Grrr. So I want to have
a pulse on each beat,
and I want to have everybody's
eyeline on the horizon
going like this and I want some
people to do this
because everyone's
doing this right now.
It's looking a little
too uniform, okay?
One, two, three, four
and oh!
And ho! That's it.
Okay.
Very good,
relax the pose.
This is only going
to take a second.
If I don't call her,
she will give me living hell.
Hello, Marjorie,
how are you?
Mm-hm. Can I
bring you anything?
Can it wait till
right after rehearsal?
We got another 40--
Okay, right away.
I'll be there.
Bye-bye.
Can you clean
this up?
I have to go right away.
Thank you.
How's it going, Carl?
Old Mrs. Nugent
just fired me.
What happened?
She said I stole
a lawn mower.
Snuck it out to my place
in Niggertown.
What?
Why does she
think that?
Oh, she saw me
leave with it,
I was taking it
to get it fixed.
Let me talk to
her, okay Carl?
Don't go getting
a new job just yet.
Okay. But I ain't
going back up there.
Not today anyway.
I don't blame you.
I will get to the bottom of it and I
will call you back. Okay?
So sorry about this.
Alright.
Oh, you just pop up whenever it's
convenient for you!
Just when you think
it's fine for you,
you come! Well, fine
fine, fine, fine!
What happened with Carl?
I got rid of him! I caught him
red handed!
God knows what else he's been
stealing from me, Bernie!
He says he was
gonna get it fixed.
- That's what he says.
- Well, I don't think Carl--
And those flowers
he's supposedly planted,
they were supposed
to bloom two weeks ago.
He's a lazy good fer nothin'.
The man's never done anything!
I don't think that he would ever
do anything like--
Why are you stickin'
up for his kind?
Marjorie, you're making it
very hard to be your friend.
I'm gonna come back
some other time.
Oh, just go ahead,
desert me.
Just like everybody else, go ahead,
go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Go, go, go!
You hate me!
Marjorie, I am not
going to take part
in this argument.
You know.
- I know you hate me!
- No!
Like everybody else!
Oh.
Basically, it was like Bernie
became her property.
You'll never leave me.
Never.
He was her sole source
of entertainment,
had to do everything for her.
I truly believe the guy felt he
was smothered, choked,
unable to get his wind.
I don't know how the guy
stood it. Well.
Come on, just pull
the damn trigger.
I don't think I can. It doesn't
feel aimed right.
Look, look,
all I want
is for you to
shoot that armadillo
that is digging
up my garden, okay?
I mean, is that too
much for me to ask,
for you to be a man
for once in your life?
Fine.
Now I'm holding
you responsible
for anything getting
dug up in my garden.
Okay? You go out and
fix those holes yourself.
Dig one
you can fit in.
Let me see.
Did you go
by the cleaners
to pick up my dress?
Yes, earlier.
Did you lysol
my kitchen counters?
Mm-hm.
Did you pick up the Preparation H
from the pharmacy?
No, but I figured
we'd go by there
on the way to lunch. Do you still want to
go to Jalapeño Treat?
- I guess.
- Okay, hold still.
Jeez.
Will you be attending
our dress
rehearsal tonight?
No.
Marjorie?
Marjorie, are you okay?
Marjorie, say
something to me.
Marjorie, can
you talk to me?
Marjorie, can you
say something?
Oh no, no,
no, no, no!
Oh, Jesus, no, no,
no, what have I done?
Oh, God!
What have I done?
Please tell me
what to do!
I'll do whatever
you want me to do!

Great job, everyone.
It seemed like the flags were
a little late,
also I want to make sure that those
fleahops are right.
Now I got off that time
but I feel like I got off
because one of you got off.
But it was
a really great job.
Take five, we're gonna take
it again from the top.
I don't think too many of us
ever asked very many questions
about Mrs. Nugent,
and if we did,
he would always have
a very plausible explanation.
Hello, Billy,
this is Bernie Tiede
calling on behalf
of Mrs. Nugent.
Yes, yes, she missed her
holiday haircut appointment
but she's asked me to tell you that
she won't be coming back in.
She wants to try
someone else.
Well, I'm sorry to say this
but she says that you take too long
and charge too much.
Billy, I'm sorry, but I'm just
the messenger.
I was rather devastated
at the very idea
that she was not coming anymore
after 30 years
of being her
friend, hairdresser,
confidante sometimes,
and she just
was gonna vanish.
It was easy
for her to disappear.
Nobody was looking for her.
Not her son,
not her two sisters.
One of them
lived here in Carthage.
They hadn't spoken
in about 10 years.
You want to sign
this for Mrs. Nugent,
our generous benefactor?
Only person looking for her
was her stockbroker.
Oh, God.
Hello?
Bernie?
Bernie!
Wh--where's Marjorie?
I--I--I haven't spoken to her in
over five weeks,
I've left 11 messages.
She's with me
right now, Lloyd,
and I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you earlier
but she's had a series
of small strokes.
I've been meaning to call you and let
you know her situation.
Mm-hm. No, she should
not be attempting to talk. No.
No, you can't talk.
The doctor said--
She's indicating for me
to tell you hi from her.
He sends you
all his best.
Okay, well,
we'll be in touch
when she's feeling better.
In the meantime,
let me know
if I can help you
with anything. Okay.
Okay, bye-bye.
Bernie knew better
than touch my accounts.
But he was going after what
would go into her bank accounts
because that's where
all the royalty checks went.
It's usually 50,000 a month.
Now he really started
being generous.
He paid 5,000 dollars for the Shreveport
orchestra to come over play the Messiah.
He bought a high dollar
harpsichord for school.
He paid for the choir
to go to Russia.
Well, yeah, he hired me back
for more money,
which is fine with me.
Oh, he bought jet skis,
he bought nine cars,
he bought struggling businesses,
he paid 40,000 dollars
for Carthage Awards.
That's a trophy shop.
He loaned the money
to the Yokums over here,
that opened up Boot Scootin
Western Wear.
I guess that was Carthage's answer
to Neiman's.
Bernie just told everybody to
pay him back when they could.
You know,
pay me when you can.
But they never did.
Bernie knew my twin girls'
birthday was coming up,
and he thought
they should have
a big nice
playhouse, you know?
Little girls.
Bernie bought this
playhouse for my girls.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I just feel like I need to say,
Bernie Tiede, God bless you, son.
You've done more to transform
the town of Carthage than anyone else.
- Oh, thank you.
- God bless you, Bernie.
Bernie could've bought a mansion
for himself with the money.
But he kept
that little house
worth, maybe, 50, 000.
Now he bought cars
for folks that needed it.
And he paid cash for those.
But that old Lincoln
he was drivin'?
He had it financed.
And he was usually behind
on his payments.
No, there really
wasn't any greed in him.
Almost everything he
got from Mrs. Nugent,
he gave to somebody else.
Lloyd seems to be
pretty concerned.
He thinks the family
should get involved.
Oh, good lord,
you gotta be kidding me.
I don't know why
Lloyd is so paranoid.
It's like I told him.
She's at the Scott White
Nursing Home in Temple.
She didn't want
everyone to know,
'cause she's afraid
the family would come in
and try to take
over her affairs.
That sounds
just like Marjorie.
Mm-hm. That's
Marjorie alright.
- Mm-hm.
- One hundred percent.
You know, Bernie,
she's my sister,
and I guess that
I should love her.
But she's just mean.
She's just hard down mean.
Mm. Well, there's some
goodness in there, too.
She used to tear
up my toys,
she pulled the heads
off my dolls,
she used to tear up
my homework.
And next up
is Mrs. Ida Parker.
Ida says she does not
like knitting, crocheting,
gardening, cooking
fancy food,
excessive housework,
or artsy hobbies.
She's planning on doing
these things when she gets old.

Thank you.
So you saw Mrs. Nugent
in April of this year?
You know, I believe
it was April.
With your own eyes?
Well, you know, I didn't actually--
see her that day, I--
I came to her house to get
her to sign some documents.
Bernie comes to the door,
says she's feeling poorly.
Just then, he takes the documents
back and she signs them.
I go on
about my business.
Okay. It
confirms a pattern.
I appreciate it.
Well, it sounds like
Lloyd Hornbuckle
called Wayne Junior
up in Amarillo,
and got him all riled up.
Oh, boy.
You know, I think
Lloyd's just upset
because he's losing commissions
during her illness.
He can't move Mrs. Nugent's
money around
and keep taking his commissions the
way he's used to, so--
It may be so, but Dwayne Junior says
his money
comes in every year for his
kids from his dad's will.
It hadn't come
in this year.
And it won't until Mrs. Nugent's
in better condition
to take care of such things.
The poor lady's
in the hospital
having suffered
a major stroke.
She simply doesn't
want to be disturbed.
Tell everyone
for heaven's sake,
to please have
a little more patience.
Well, that's
fine with me.
I don't want her
disturbing me,
if you wanna
know the truth.
I'm sorry you had to get wrapped up
in all this.
Oh, forget about it,
Lloyd Hornbuckle's just a busybody.
- I'll see you later, Bernie.
- Thank you, Sheriff.
Hello.
You are living
in a wold of guilt.
All the police have to do
is find one shred of evidence
and it's off
to hell you go.
Lloyd, is that you?
Lloyd? Hello--
Bernie, are
you okay?
Hm? Yeah,
I just, uh--
Can I ask
you something?
Of course.
It's so strange.
Do you believe a person could
be capable of--
an action--
and yet to them
it feels like
it's not even
them doing it.
Almost like
Jekyll and Hyde?
Bernie, stop worrying,
it's okay.
Someone's personal proclivities are
nobody's else's business.
We all love you like you are,
Bernie, no matter what.
# Shackled by a heavy burden #
# B'neath the load
Of guilt and shame #
# Then the hand
Of Jesus touched me #
# And now I am
No longer the same #
# He touched me,
Oh he touched me #
- God bless you, Bernie.
- God bless you, Mr. Brown.
- That was beautiful.
- Thank you.
- You have a blessed weekend.
- God bless you too.
Thank you.
As always, Bernie,
I love the songs.
- Thank you.
- My sympathies.
Thank you, MariBelle,
it's always great to see you.
I'm so sorry
Marjorie didn't hear that,
I hear she's doing better.
Yes, some days it seems she's starting
to feel better but, um--
I'm still afraid--
I'm gonna lose her soon.
Finally.
Nine months since I had last laid
eyes on Mrs. Nugent,
we got into her house.
Grandma?
Mrs. Nugent?
Grandma?
Nothing.
Hm.
There's nothing.
Why would she tape
her freezer shut?
Oh, my God.
Sheriff!
Sir, I'm a reporter
for KCM channel.
Ma'am, hold on.
Would you care to make a statement
about what's going on?
- Sheriff?
- Hey, Danny.
- In the freezer?
- Yeah.
All in one piece
or chopped up?
- All in one piece.
- Holy shit.
Frozen like a Popsicle.
Be careful.
Alright, get rolling,
straight to Dallas,
no stopping for coffee.
- Alright.
- No sir, we ain't stoppin'.
We had loaded up the freezer
with its contents intact
for transport to the Dallas
Medical Examiner's office
where the forensic
experts over there
are gonna study it.
At this time, are there
any suspects in the murder?
Oh, there's one man
in particular I can think of
I sure would
like to talk to.
Hey, Sheriff, did
you actually find him yet?
We're still
looking for him.
He wasn't
at Carthage aviation,
Carthage Awards
or his house.
Alright, look--
we're gonna throw a net over
the entire tri-county area
to find our number
one suspect.
We might be dealing
with a madman here,
a bonafide deranged killer.
Achieving goals,
mastering skills,
the opponent
isn't the other team,
it's really just yourself.
And if you've worked hard,
and done the absolute
best that you can,
then no matter what
the scoreboard says,
you are the winner
in the game of life.
You can hold
your head high--
Mr. Tiede, may we have a word
with you?
Of course.
Right now?
Sure.
I'm gonna go talk
to the police.
Gentlemen, you have
earned yourself--
a great dessert.
Go, Rattlers.
I'm so proud of you.
This way.
How long you been thinking
about killing her, Bernie?
I never thought of me
killing Mrs. Nugent.
I'd--I guess I fantasized about
her death,
but I was never
the one responsible for it.
She always died
accidentally like--
in a car accident or falling down
the escalator at the mall in Longview.
I was always the one
weeping by her open casket.
Comforting others,
being comforted myself.
Why'd you want
her dead, Bernie?
Mm, she had become so mean
and possessive of me.
I--I couldn't face being
around her any longer.
And then it just--happened.
I don't know.
I shot her!
I shot poor
Mrs. Nugent four times.
With the armadillo gun.
Then what?
Well, then the Lord
called her Home.
I know I done wrong and I must
atone for my sins. Oh!
Elizabeth, I just heard Bernie
killed your sister Margy.
Oh, honey, no.
Marjorie's in a nursing
home over in Timble.
No, no, she is in a deep freeze
going to Dallas.
Nobody in a million years
could've imagined that
that could've happened.
Shock! I could not
believe Bernie did this.
No way.
Well, it was fucking unbelievable.
Nobody could believe it.
You know, I could see somebody wantin'
to do that to her,
but Bernie Tiede's the last person
I woulda thought done it.
I mean, we were just shocked,
just shocked. Just disbelief.
The Bernie I knew
was somewhat of a sissy.
And it just ain't no way
I can see him
ever killing anybody.
I thought they'd
made a mistake.
You got this sweet guy,
you got Bernie,
who's just the nicest fella
I'd ever met,
and I've known him
for a little while,
and then you
got--Mrs. Nugent
who is not nice,
not nice to a
large degree, just evil.
So you got this sweetness
and you got this evil,
and they're kinda battlin'
each other, uh--
and you know that something
at some point's gotta give,
something's gotta break
and she was justs more evil than he
was nice, I guess,
and he just exploded.
We're all capable
of that dark moment.
If we ever get
angry enough.
He must've wanted
to get caught.
All he had to do
was put her body
in one of his airplanes,
fly her out over the Gulf
and push her right out.
No body,
no arrest.
A woman like that
with a bad heart--
he shoulda just shoved the pillow right
over her face.
Then they probably wouldn't
even done an autopsy.
A few days later, he'd be doing
her funeral.
Oh, I just started
shaking my head
going, "Oh Bernie,
Bernie, Bernie, Bernie."
Who in their right mind
would kill their meal ticket?
It was crazy
around here.
People were on Danny Buck
like ticks on a coon dog.
Yeah, Danny Buck, you know Bernie
didn't know
anything about
shooting a rifle.
He didn't go huntin',
he wouldn't know a deer blind
from an outhouse.
That he wouldn't.
There are not enough
nice men in this town.
Leave poor Bernie alone,
Danny Buck.
We don't even
think he did it.
He confessed.
Danny Buck,
you knew Mrs. Nugent
as well as any of us did.
Did you ever
stop to think
maybe, just maybe
Bernie did it
in self defense.
Self defense.
Maybe it was a
forced confession.
They could've
beat it out of him.
He's too sweet to stand
up under interrogation.
Look, there was
no interrogation.
He walked in, sat down and
told us everything.
Simple as that.
Well, hell.
Even if he did do it,
she was so mean
and ornery,
she had it coming to her.
It's not as bad as
people say it is.
He only shot her
four times, not five.
You know what?
You people are
as crazy as a coot.
I like Bernie Tiede
as much as you do.
He did shoot
her though!
I tell you what.
I don't claim to
know what Bernie did
or did not do.
I figure that's between him and
God Almighty.
Mm-hm. And the
way I figure it,
that's where it
should stay.
Man, I hope
I'm on that jury.
Yes, we need to be able to forgive
someone who's done something wrong.
And no matter what
the truth is,
Bernie is going
to need our prayers.
So, folks, we
need to understand
that tragedies are simply tests
of our faith.
And right now,
Bernie needs to know,
especially during this
testing of his faith,
that God
and this congregation
have not
abandoned him.
Good to see you,
thanks for coming.
Good to see you.
God bless you
for everything.
Reverend. Now listen,
I understand you going all New Testament
on him but uh--
you got to at least
take him off the prayer list.
Hey, I gotta stay neutral,
everybody needs a preacher.
Neutral?
Reverend, basically you were
supporting a criminal act.
You know, all I hear
is poor Bernie.
Nobody's talking
about poor Marjorie.
Hell, everyone seems
to be forgetting
that there's a lady,
a member of this congregation,
shot in the back four times
and put in the freezer.
Danny, the Bernie
you're talking about
is not the Bernie
this church knows.
The heck it isn't.
It sounds like the only Bernie you're
choosing to remember
is the one that donated 100,000 dollars
to your church. Reverend.
Danny, look, I'm sorry you
feel that--
It's been hard
on everyone.
Alright, kiddos.
All the good that Bernie had done
for everybody,
or for us around here,
it just--
they come in, and then it was
gonna get all
Mrs. Nugent's money
back that Bernie had spent.
We lost our airport,
we lost our best store,
cars, some people
lost their houses,
jet skis.
He spent 600, 000 dollars
of Mrs. Nugent's money.
No paperwork, anything?
A receipt?
I don't know,
I mean--
he just gave it to me,
said I could have it.
Well, you know, at least
they could've left
some money for the church.
Hell.
Here they come!
Although rumors have
been circulating
about a possible
plea bargain
to lesser charges
or a probated sentence,
District Attorney
Danny Buck Davidson
has shocked East Texas
by filing first degree murder charges
against Tiede,
which could result
in a life sentence.
Clearly, the tiny town of Carthage
is buzzing
with opinions
over the murder.
He didn't shoot Mrs. Nugent in
the back.
He didn't do it.
Bernhardt Tiede
ain't no monster.
Ain't no jury
gonna convict Bernie
of first degree murder.
In fact, I don't know
if a jury's gonna
convict him of anything
and I'll say this,
if a jury as to convict him,
they'll probably gonna
give him probation.
They ain't gonna send him
to the penitentiary.
In the meantime, Bernie sits in
the county jail
where he's reportedly
already become
a popular inmate
leading a Bible study group
and cooking meals
for the staff.
Now, we are going
to line the bottom
of the pie dish
with cheese
to provide a barrier between
the liquid and the crust.
Now a lot of people
use grated cheese,
but I found that if you cut
it in little quarter inch cubes,
it does a better job of keeping the
crust from getting soggy.
Now, we are going to sauté
the broccoli lightly in olive oil
till it's just bright green.
That keeps
the flavor in.
If you put it in raw,
it's completely flavorless.
I'm not saying we want
the case totally dropped,
but isn't there some way to keep Bernie
from getting punished too much?
That's $14.74.
So let me ask you
something, Mrs. Beck.
If someone came along and shot
you in the back four times,
would you still be fine with me not
letting them get punished too much?
If I'm on that
jury, Danny Buck,
I'm votin' to acquit.
As far as convicting Bernie,
I feed you straight. I mean,
even with the confession in my pocket,
I was a bit trepidacious.
I mean, it's like he cast a spell over
the entire area.
All the little old ladies,
Methodist church people,
anybody he'd ever
given anything to.
With Mrs. Nugent's money.
All the closet homosexuals.
Everybody.
Everybody thought he
was gonna get off.
But I had one
card left to play.
And I went all in.
Trials are generally moved
when the judge determines
that the defendant can't get
a fair trial locally.
And that's usually because the crime
is so egregious and so well known
that everybody in the community
has already convicted
the poor son
of a bitch accused of it.
But in all the years I've been
doing this for a living,
I have never heard
of the state
seeking a change of venue
because the defendant
was so well liked
that they couldn't
get a conviction.
So when I heard that the judge
had actually agreed to move the trial,
giving in to Danny Buck's
harebrained request,
my first thought
was, "Oh, shit.
Our donkey's in a ditch."
Bring in the freezer.
Let the jury be able to see
where Mrs. Nugent spent the first
nine months of her afterlife.
A poor excuse for a casket.
Boys, make sure it opens up
to the jury.
There's some wild shit on
both sides of the courtroom.
But, you know,
this was the big stage
the big town, the big show they'd
been waiting for
and they pulled
out all the stops.
They wheeled in
the actual deep freeze.
Mm-hm.
They projected pictures
of frozen dead Mrs. Nugent.
And then they started bringing
out the crying weeping relatives.
And then I went
to the freezer.
And I saw
underneath her corn
and her steak and--
her pot pies was--
the top of her head.
It was so horrible.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
When was the last time you talked
to your grandmother?
Um, I don't remember.
Isn't it true that
you and your brother
sued your grandmother
almost four years ago?
We were advised
to by a lawyer.
A lawyer?
You mean, just some old boy
come in off the street?
Or are we talking
about your lawyer?
I guess he was working for us.
I'll say he was
working for you.
He was trying to get your grandmother's
money, wasn't he?
Did you ever speak
to her after that?
I don't think so.
Oh, you don't think so.
Well, you know
you didn't.
But you told us earlier that you
were real close to your grandmother.
Now was that the same woman
you were suing for money?
Is that the same woman
that you have not spoken to
in four years?
I felt in our hearts
we were still close.
I knew he was in trouble
when I saw that jury.
And Bernie was just gonna have to
get up there and explain himself
to a bunch of Saint Augustine
cousin-countin' rednecks over there.
I mean, they got more
tattoos than teeth
and there ain't no brain in the
whole dozen of 'em,
and they're supposed
to decide
big things like this?
I mean, shoot, I wouldn't let 'em
work on my car.
Now, Bernie,
after you were arrested you gave
a confession, correct?
Yes, sir.
How did you feel
about Marjorie Nugent?
I cared for Marjorie deeply.
I loved her very much.
And I've sent letters
from jail to her family
asking their forgiveness
for ruining Margy's life
and the pain I've caused.
Well, if you cared for her,
even loved her,
why do you reckon
you killed her?
I could probably describe it like
being in prison
to some degree.
She wouldn't allow me
to have any friends,
and I'm a people person.
I got to have my friends.
She was very jealous
and possessive of my time.
She had become
so hateful.
I don't even remember
picking up the gun that day.
It was like someone else
was doing it.
So why did you
leave the body there?
It would seem to me that
if you didn't
want to get caught,
you'd find some way
to dispose of it.
Oh no, no, no.
I could never do that.
That was never my intention.
Everyone deserves
a proper burial.
And I was--
I was just waiting for my chance
to give her one.
Thank you, Bernie.
I'll pass the witness.
So help me
out here, Bernie.
On this trip with Mrs. Nugent
to New York City,
did you fly first class?
Yes, I believe we did.
Tell us the difference between
like the first class seats
and the regular old seats
in the back of the plane.
I--I've never been up there.
I'd say the seats
are a little larger maybe.
More comfortable.
Don't they have people waiting' on
you and stuff too, you know?
I mean, people
bringing you fancy food,
and serving you whatever you want to
drink and stuff like that?
Yes, the service
is probably a little better.
Oh, so you like the
first class treatment.
First class lifestyle,
the best that money can buy.
I was accompanying
Mrs. Nugent
who usually preferred these things
when she traveled.
- Mm-hm.
- So.
Now, on that
New York City trip,
it says here that
you and Mrs. Nugent
stayed at the--
the Ritz Carlton?
That's a fancy hotel
near Central Park, isn't it?
Yes, I believe that
is where we stayed.
It also says here that while you were
in New York City,
you saw an opera.
And a Broadway play.
I think it's called
"Les Miserables. "
Les Miserable.
That's impressive.
What?
So culture
is important to you.
In what way?
Well, you seem to know all
these fancy words and such.
Well, that one's
not very difficult.
Not for you.
You know all about the high class life,
don't you?
I--what--like what?
Like, I don't know,
say for instance what--
what kind of wine are you supposed
to have with fish?
No, I don't-- white usually.
Mm-hm. That takes
a lot of money
to have so much
culture, don't it?
To--to enjoy the finer
things in life
that you love so much.
The ritzy hotels, first class flying
off to the big cities.
I mean, it takes
a lot of money
to live that way, don't it?
No, I--left
to my own devices,
I would not have been traveling
in such an expensive--
But left to someone
else's devices, you were!
And after you killed
Mrs. Nugent,
you kept on spending
her money, didn't you?
A lot of it!
And if you wouldn't
a been caught,
you'd still be spending her
money today.
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
Ladies and gentlemen,
after listening to
all the evidence,
I'm sure that you will agree
that the defendant
is a liar, a coward
and a backshooter.
Now, come on.
That's got to be
about the lowest thing
a man could ever do,
ain't it?
Shoot a little old
lady in the back?
Four times.
There is no doubt
in my mind
Bernie Tiede is a calculating
evil actor.
He fooled a whole town
for nine months.
Now if he can do that,
there ain't no telling
what he'll do
if you let him
back on the streets.
That poor woman stayed frozen
stiff for nine whole months.
In a freezer.
It took two days
to thaw her out.
Just so they could
perform a proper autopsy.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.
Your honor, counsel,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
all Danny Buck Davidson
wants to do in this trial
is get you to believe that Bernie
is some kind of monster.
That he is something other than
a fellow human being.
Look at him,
ladies and gentlemen.
There is not one hint
of premeditation in this case.
If there was, he'd have
done it a lot differently.
He mighta
gotten away with it.
Did he try to poison
her slowly? No.
Did he burn down the house?
Say it was an
accidental fire? No.
He still knew he done wrong.
He knew he was gonna
get found out.
He just didn't have
the courage
to tell on himself.
But like a good
funeral director,
he preserved the body so that she
could have a proper burial.
And in the meantime he did
a lot of good for a lot of people.
Till he finally got caught.
He just doesn't sound like any kind
of monster I've ever heard of.
Thank you.
That doesn't excuse
the crime that was committed.
Now look, everybody's describing
Bernie Tiede as such a great guy.
"Oh, he's so wonderful.
He's an angel."
Let me tell you,
he's an angel alright.
An angel of death.
Thank you.
Bernie Tiede,
please rise.
Mr. Foreman, it
is my understanding
that the jury
has reached a verdict.
Yes, sir, we have,
Your Honor.
Is it unanimous?
Yes, sir.
Would you please
read the verdict?
We, the jury,
find the defendant
Bernie Tiede,
guilty of murder
as charged.
They gave me life.
I won't even be up for parole
for 50 years.
I'll be 89 years old.
Danny Buck, you gotta hand
it to him.
What he did,
is two groups, you know.
It was the high-falutin'
first class livin'
Bernies of the world,
and then there was
the, you know,
let's dig a hole in the backyard
and cook something, you know?
Put another tire on the fire, George.
I'm cold.
It was just two different worlds
he created there
and Bernie wasn't
of their world.
It's not as bad
as you think.
I'm the choir director,
teaching four classes.
I'm in the craft shop
most of the day.
I miss my freedom.
Well, sure you do, hon.
I'm making the best of it.
Got a lot to live for.
You do.
You do.
I wanna help people here.
Hm, well, I have to tell you what
I've done.
I wrote the warden a letter.
Yeah, I did.
I told him that he had to give you
a work release
or something like that
so that you could
sing at my funeral.
Now, I'm not sick or anything,
but now Bernie,
you promised me that
you would do that.
And I totally mean wear
those chains or whatever
if it made them
feel better so--
That is awful
sweet, Lenora.
And it would be an honor but don't
count on it.
I don't think they're letting me
out of here for nothing.
Oh!
Sure they will. I told him that you
went temporarily insane.
And we're all going
insane sooner or later.
I mean, that's the way
I look at it.
Uh-oh. He's telling
me our time is up.
I cannot tell you
how much it means to me
that I'm still
in your prayers.
And that I'll
always be with you.
Yes. And you know
how much we love you.
And I will tell you,
I look around here.
You need to take
care of yourself
and be real careful
because I think
this could be
a dangerous place.
- You think?
- I do.
And we'll come back
in a couple of weeks.
Take care.
I love you.
I love you, baby.
You take care of him.
I don't care what he did.
Yes, I do care.
It was wrong.
But I believed that if Bernie
were truly sorry for what he did,
and would ask
God's forgiveness,
God would forgive him.
And after all, that's all that
really matters.
I will miss him.
All of us will.
I'll never believe
till the day God calls me home
that Bernie Tiede killed
Mrs. Nugent.
And--and that's
just the way I feel.
And my husband told me,
"Daisy, when you go up there,
"you don't change your mind if
you see some of those people
"standing out there in the
courthouse that you love,
"that's your friends too."
I said, "Hey, I don't think Jesus
could change my mind."
That's just the way I feel
from day one.
And I will always
feel that way.
Bernie was a good man.
Bernie had a great heart.
We need more Bernies
in this world.
Murderers come along
once in a blue moon over here
and typically,
they're family related,
I mean, it's just how it
works out,
we don't have
strange killings,
it's just some family member
got upset with the other
and shot him,
killed him dead,
and they know
they gonna go
to penitentiary
for a while.
Now we even have
less murder trials
'cause most of 'em
plead out.
So this thing
becomes a media circus,
we got people coming in from
all across the United States.
Old Danny Buck, we caught him
with a stiff neck,
he--he got kind
of stiff neck,
kinda get your neck
a little stiff,
he got a stiff neck,
he was like a pig in shit
when all this
was going up.
Talking about what
wine to drink with fish,
I mean, those people drink warm beer
with fried mudcat
and he's trying to say--
I took one look at the jury and
I said, Uh-oh.
Scrappy, you ain't
gonna do it, buddy.
I mean, you
ain't gonna do it.
You don't have
enough equipment to bring
these people outta
their dang hovels over there.
Jesus, he's my daddy,
he's my cousin.
It's like, some
of them people
shouldn't be allowed
out of the county
and we took the whole
damn trial over there, you know?
What are they asking for?
I don't get it.
I don't get
the legal system.
