Forget it, loser.
Forget it, loser.
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.
-Hey.
-Hey, bro.
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?
-Hey, man.
-Hey.
Jennifer--
Did you see his eyes?
What are you looking at, dork?
Fuck off.
l appreciate you guys coming down.
The only thing l'm gonna miss
in this dump is....
Settle down.
Settle down.
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.
Settle down.
Settle down.
-Beats study hall, doesn't it?
-No!
-That you, Jimmy?
-At least in study hall l can meditate.
What he means is, ''masturbate.''
Something with which l'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.
lt wasn't me, man.
lt wasn't me.
l'm innocent.
l'm innocent.
We've all heard the terms
''date rape,'' ''sexual harassment.''
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.
Detectives Duquette and Perez...
...are here to give us
what we hope...
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.
-Thank you.
-l'm out of here.
-Why don't we begin with a question.
-This prick can kiss my ass.
As l was saying...
...why don't we begin
with a question.
-What is a sex crime?
-Not getting any.
What's with that?
She's the one who walked out.
-Suzie Toller.
-l busted her last year for possession.
Poor kid did six months
in Camp Nine.
-Six months? First offense?
-l didn't hand down the sentence.
She was dirty.
l busted her.
Hey, Carol.
l appreciate you guys
taking the time to come.
Our pleasure.
Why do l get the feeling you don't
like the guidance counselor?
Don't tell me you can't see through
his routine. He's a total hound.
You mean pussy hound?
Actually, l thought
he was kind of cute.
l'd do him.
Steady.
Steady the bow, Jimmy.
That's good.
Drop the main.
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and l'll see you all Monday.
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.
Do you do windows?
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.
-See you, Mr. Lombardo.
-All right, buddy.
All right.
l could definitely party
on one of those.
lt's a stinkpot, Jimmy.
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.
Yeah.
That's a real boat.
Thank you for getting me
into this class.
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.
l put myself through college
working on boats.
-Beats flipping burgers.
-Yeah.
Can l play too, or is it just for boys?
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?
The senior car wash, remember?
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and l do it?
We're working as a team.
l tell you what. l'm going out
to the glades Saturday.
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.
Deal.
l was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.
Surprise, surprise.
So l was wondering
if you could give me one.
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?
l mean, like,
something bad might happen.
-What about you, you need a lift?
-Yeah, but l got my bike.
Hey, no problem.
Okay, try it.
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
''Whores 4 Less''?
Try it again.
Nice to see you kids getting along.
-Don't forget Sunday.
-l won't.
-ls that Sam Lombardo?
-Hi, Mom.
Sam, hi.
Hi, Sandra.
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.
Sorry, Sandra, l gotta run.
-Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
-Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
Hi, girls.
Look. He forgot.
-l knew it.
-No, l didn't.
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.
Sam, l'm leaving.
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?
Come on, Barbara.
lt's for a good cause.
Sam the philanthropist.
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.
Okay.
-Have fun at the club.
-Okay.
Wow.
Looks brand-new.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.
Oh, yeah, that thing.
-Can't we just--?
-Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Okay, let me look for it.
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?
You can give me a ride
when you find it.
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?
-Go.
-Are you sure?
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Goddamn it!
-Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
-Hello.
Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday--
Jesus H. Christ!
-What?
-Oh, nothing.
Come on.
-Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
-lt's a barracuda.
lf you weren't so busy
chasing booty...
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.
Why not?
lt's a barracuda. lt's poisonous.
lt'll kill you.
Shit, man, l could say that
about most of the girls you date.
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.
-Sandra, what's up?
-Kelly skipped school today, Sam.
Have you heard anything?
Not a word.
Never mind.
l found her.
Pull!
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.
Sandra, l'm real busy right now, so--
l haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.
-Yeah, well--
-l know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.
-So what?
-So maybe l'm a one-woman man now.
Aw, poor Sam.
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?
-Are you finished, Sandra?
-Grab a clue, honey.
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.
Enjoy it, while it lasts.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Pull!
You seem to find guns therapeutic.
Maybe l ought to try it.
So let me guess.
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.
So you're taking the day off. Right?
Which one of your deck hands
is that?
Whichever one l want.
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?
What is it?
l miss Dad.
Jesus.
l miss him too, sometimes.
No, you don't.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.
Oh, Kelly....
l don't know why he did it.
l really don't.
Can l--?
Can l get you anything?
Do you want a Valium?
l was raped.
-What, honey? l can't hear you.
-l said, l was raped.
What?
l was raped...
...by Sam Lombardo.
Sam Lombardo?
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.
We'd like to take her statement alone.
-Are you all right with this, baby?
-Yeah.
Okay.
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?
l just wanna get it over with.
We'd like to videotape this statement.
l know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.
Are you ready?
He started rubbing my shoulders.
I let him.
I mean, he's a nice guy.
The next thing...
...his hand was in my shorts.
You know, from behind.
His fingers....
-His fingers....
-Take your time.
They were in me.
Both places, you know?
Did he put himself inside you?
Yes.
I said ''Stop. ''
I screamed.
I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.
He hurt me.
Did you try to fight him?
Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.
Then what?
He kept saying, ''Let it happen.
Let it happen. ''
And then he just stopped.
You mean he withdrew?
I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.
Try, Kelly.
I know one thing he said.
He said, ''Don't worry.
I didn't come. ''
I can't forget that.
He said, ''No little girl
can ever make me come. ''
''No little girl can ever
make me come.'' Jesus.
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.
What?
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.
You want my gut? There it is.
l think she's acting.
l think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.
She's upset because he didn't.
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.
The line l have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
That doesn't make him a rapist.
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.
-You know what that'll mean for him.
-Yeah.
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.
All right.
Good work, Jimbo.
l'll see you Monday.
All right.
That's what's left of my sailing class.
Talk to me, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.
Jimmy told me.
Apparently, l'm the last one
to know about it.
Sam, l....
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...
...with every member
of the school board.
She's pushing for suspension.
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?
This is insane.
l'm innocent, goddamn it.
You gotta believe that.
All l can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.
They clear you, you get reinstated--
You never get clear
of something like this.
lt stays with you.
lt follows you around forever.
You're gonna need some help, Sam.
You're gonna need an attorney.
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.
l'm here to see Ken Bowden.
-Do you have an appointment?
-Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.
Okay, then.
Mr. Bowden,
your 1 0:30's here.
Will you show him in, please?
What brings you
to this part of town?
Well, l was, until yesterday...
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.
A student there
is accusing me of rape.
Male or female?
-The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
-As in Sandra Van Ryan?
As in, l'm fucked.
Why don't you tell me about it?
-Shit, where do l begin?
-Start with...
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.
She's a student. l was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.
You got nothing to worry about.
-What did you do to your neck?
-This?
l don't have to wear it all the time.
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.
All right, let me tell you
how l charge.
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?
Mr. Lombardo, l'm afraid
l can't park your car today.
You can't park me?
l'm meeting Barbara for lunch.
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.
Right away, Mr. Baxter.
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.
Barbara, let's go.
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.
You're finished in Blue Bay.
l find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Mr. Lombardo, please.
That's all right, George.
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.
-Welcome back.
-Rum and Coke.
Hey! Are you all right?
-l'm fine.
-Cool?
That's too bad, motherfucker.
Sam?
Lombardo?
Whoa, man! lt's me.
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.
l can see that.
Come on in.
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?
lt was him, all right.
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.
-Forget it.
-The lady has deep pockets.
Believe me, l know how deep
her pockets are.
l thought l might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?
l don't need any more trouble
from this woman.
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?
With the shit l got on Kelly?
Yeah.
A year ago...
...when her old man
blew his brains out...
...Kelly lost it, ran away.
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.
Meanwhile...
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...
...or some crap.
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.
And they're not gonna find it.
Right?
Ken, l don't fuck my students.
He's just showing off
for you now.
Hey there, Ruby.
l see you still got Walter.
l was hoping something
had eaten him by now.
-Can l help you with something?
-Suzie called us.
Where would we find her?
You know the way.
You won't shoot her, will you?
l don't believe she's armed.
Yeah?
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?
l mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?
My partner, Detective Perez.
lt's C¨¦line. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?
No.
-Will they?
-l don't know.
That bothers you?
l wanna go outside.
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?
About a year ago.
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?
-Nope.
-So you were alone.
Yeah.
Did he come in with you?
-l guess.
-You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?
Okay. Yeah, he did.
And then what? Did he touch you?
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?
Suzie, look, l know you feel bad.
-Just tell us the truth.
-l didn't say a thing to him.
He just put his arm around me
and told me l was pretty.
l could be really pretty, he said.
Did you ask him to stop?
Shit.
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.
-Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
-Yeah. Okay? He did.
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.
-Now are we done?
-Almost, Suzie.
Almost.
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?
No. He stopped by himself.
Okay? ls that it?
Leave me alone.
-Don't touch me!
-All right, take it easy. Take it easy.
He stopped.
And that was it? He just left?
Yeah.
He did say one thing first.
What was that?
He said, ''No little bitch
can ever make me come.''
Open the gate.
-Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
-Hello, Jinxy.
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...
...instead of a public defender.
l'm telling you, Ken, l'm innocent.
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.
So you're the new
chicken licker.
Sandra, can we get your comment?
Can l just have your feelings
at this time?
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.
Can you tell us anything?
-Are you confident about the case?
-Very. Yes.
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. ln the end, the jury...
...must choose between the words
of these 1 8-year-old girls...
...and that of Sam Lombardo.
Reporting from the courthouse steps,
l'm Nancy Duerr.
Eyewitness News.
The State of Florida
v. Sam Lombardo.
The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman
presiding. All rise.
We gotta stand up.
Please be seated.
Now sit down.
Would you like more time, Kelly?
l know that this is hard, Kelly...
...but l have one more question.
And even though it's something
we've been over...
...l want us all
to be very clear about it.
Kelly , when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...
...intended to have sex with you...
...what were your exact words?
What did you say?
l told him ''No.''
l said,
''Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please.''
l screamed for him to stop.
You screamed for him...
...to stop.
And did he?
No.
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.
Thank you.
lt's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...
lt's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...
...of the former guidance counselor
has taken the stand.
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered
an emotional account of events...
...and was not swayed by
defense counsel's cross-examination.
We'll come back live later
with an update of these proceedings.
Reporting from the courthouse
steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...
...Eyewitness News.
Good morning, everybody.
Ms. Toller.
When you were...
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...
...and you were allowed
to make one call...
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
lsn't that correct?
Ms. Toller?
-Yes.
-And when you were expelled...
...for destruction
of school property--
l broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.
lt was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.
ls that right?
Yes.
lt seems to me...
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.
He was.
But all that changed when...
...according to your testimony...
...Mr. Lombardo...
...raped you...
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?
-Yes.
-But then in May...
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...
...and again allowed a phone call...
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
-So what?
-So what?
So what?
Oops, Suzie.
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.
-l needed help.
-l'm sure you did.
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.
lt was summer, he was gone...
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.
Did that make you mad, Suzie...
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?
ls that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...
-...your friend?
-l said them because they happened.
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?
l said he did.
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?
Because l promise you,
if you are lying about this...
...and l believe you are...
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.
Which is why l'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.
Suzie...
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.
-Ms. Toller.
-Goddamn it!
-This was not my idea.
-Objection, Your Honor.
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.
Ms. Toller?
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!
l think l made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.
Ms. Toller.
l just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.
He was my friend at first.
And then l got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...
...and l had to go away
to that hell hole.
lt's like you're his favorite,
and then ''Who cares?''
Make her stop.
When Kelly said that
we should do this...
-...l thought, ''Cool.''
-Kelly!
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.
-Now they're gonna get screwed.
-l'm sorry, Your Honor.
l have to object.
Your Honor, please, may l be heard?
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.
Go sit down.
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.
She's in love with him.
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.
What? Kelly!
You skanky bitch!
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who l am?
-l'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
-Right this way.
Just get the hell away from me.
Jesus, man! Let loose!
l'm just thinking about where
l'm gonna stay.
l lost my house.
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.
You'll get over it.
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...
...against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?
Just like that?
These people ruined your life, bro.
l told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.
In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...
...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.
Excuse me. Over here.
Excuse me. Can anybody read?
Hey! Sandra!
l want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...
-...hadn't thrown things.
-Fuck off.
l cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.
l don't think you get it, Sandy.
Your princess here
committed perjury.
lt'll be all l can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.
Well, what are we going to do?
-You're gonna love this place, Tom.
-Thank you.
That jalape¨¾o pork platter
will kill you.
l mean, you can't eat sushi every day
of the week.
Bowden, why don't you
cut the crap...
...and tell me
what your client really wants.
Okay, Baxter.
My client wants your client
to saddle up...
...so we can ride her ass
straight to the bank.
You know, Ken.
May l call you Ken?
There will be other cases,
other days.
The way l see it...
...Tommy...
...is that everybody's gotta
eat some shit sometime.
You like yours hot?
Yeah.
-Here's your coffee, Sam.
-Thank you.
Ken.
Sorry l'm late.
Hold my calls, Lenore.
Okay, Mr. Bowden.
Thank you, Sandra.
l'll be seeing you.
-Okay?
-Okay. Yeah.
Nice to see you, Tom.
Come by.
We'll have lunch.
See you at the club.
See you at the club.
See you at the club.
See you at the club.
See you at the club, Tommy!
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?
Hey, my man!
This is for you.
-You did good, Ken.
-Yeah.
Thanks.
l know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.
All right? Find a happy place.
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?
-Goodbye, Sam.
-Bye, Lenore.
Take care of my lizards?
Hello, Kelly.
Drop dead.
You know how my mom's paying you
off? She's breaking my trust.
l can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.
l'm sorry, Kelly.
Why don't you start fucking her
again! You can spend it together!
l hate you! l fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!
l fucking hate you!
You see, Art? l couldn't come back
even if l wanted to.
Goddamn maid.
So you got my mom's money.
How much?
How much?
You know how much.
Your turn to pay.
lt worked! We screwed the bitch!
lt worked just like you said.
What's wrong?
You scared the shit out of me.
What's wrong is your coming here.
That's what's wrong.
Are you fucking crazy?
Yeah, l'm crazy. Ask my mom.
So how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke.
Big joke.
Everyone thinks this is really funny.
Do you think this is fucking over?
Let me tell you something.
lt's a long fucking way from over.
l'm serious.
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.
After tonight?
Yeah, well...
...we're here, aren't we?
So maybe one celebration
is okay...
...if we're in agreement...
...that from here on out...
...you do exactly as l say.
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.
Now l want you two to kiss.
Come on, now.
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.
l told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.
Hey, you're right.
They did make us look stupid.
What you're wrong about is why.
All right, hear me out.
Lombardo was having an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan, right?
Why not tell us about it?
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.
l thought about it and said: ''You're
Lombardo. Your life is trashed.
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless--''
Unless what?
Unless you're setting Sandra
Van Ryan up for the big payday.
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl
like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?
Kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.
l'm telling you,
this guy wanted to marry money.
When that didn't happen,
he went to work on these two girls...
...using them to set up
Sandra Van Ryan.
I'm telling you,
they chumped us, partner.
They chumped us
right from the start.
Nice stroke.
ls there some reason
why you're here?
-Curiosity, l guess.
-About what?
How to improve your breast stroke?
No. l want to know how you see things
working out for you, Sam and Suzie.
Excuse me?
You three gonna
go to the Caribbean together?
Live happily ever after?
You see, the thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.
You're out of your mind.
lt's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.
Especially when
two of them are in love.
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.
Am l right?
Sam sell you on the idea right up
front of whacking Suzie? Hey!
That's murder, kid.
Police. God, get a life.
You're good, you know that?
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?
Hello, Suzie.
You better watch it
with that shit.
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.
Yeah, or wind up dead.
You know...
...l don't think l ever told you
how sorry l was about your friend.
What was his name?
Come on, help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.
-Davy.
-Yeah. That's right. Davy.
l was sorry about
the way that worked out.
-That is cop bullshit.
-What was that? What was that?
l don't have to listen to this.
You can't shove me around.
-l have friends now.
-Hey!
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.
Take a look at this.
Go ahead, take it.
lt's not gonna bite you.
Take it!
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.
He transferred the funds to
a numbered offshore account.
Cops don't know the names on it.
Think one of them is yours?
He also put a down payment on island
property and a lease on a sailboat.
You're into sailing, aren't you?
l don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?
l'm telling you this because
l know exactly what's going on.
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.
Come on, now.
You don't think Kelly and Sam are
gonna share that money with you.
Leave me alone.
You know...
...l'd want a clear head
right now if l were you...
...so l could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.
l'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...
...like Davy.
Oh, shit.
You've reached Sam Lombardo.
Wait for the beep, leave a message.
l can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?
l'm scared there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
Hello?
-Kelly, is Suzie there?
-Yeah.
Christ, l was afraid of that.
She left this insane message.
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...
...and this fucking cop,
she's gonna blow it.
Calm the bitch down.
Why can't you come? Please?
Sam, l miss you so much.
l miss you too, Kelly,
but l can't right now.
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?
If she can't get a fucking grip....
-Then what?
-You know what.
I'll handle it.
But l need you, Kelly.
l need you to be there for me tonight.
-Okay.
-Good.
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know that?
Now, put Suzie on the line.
I want you both to hear this.
Suzie.
Sam?
Now, look...
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.
Now, since the settlement,
people think l'm rich...
...so l'm out there spending money,
doing what rich guys do.
This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try
and fuck with you. Don't let him.
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
-Suzie, don't fall apart.
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?
Oh, for chrissake.
You are!
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?
That's what l am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.
Don't!
You stupid cunt!
You are scared, aren't you?
Ray! Jesus Christ!
-Are you crazy?
-Hear her say ''Sam''?
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.
The conversation on the tape
is unintelligible.
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...
-...shooting a porn flick!
-l can't believe this.
A month ago, they threw things
at each other in court.
They were acting!
They were all acting!
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.
They're getting away with $8 million
from Sandra Van Ryan.
She might have saved it
if she didn't try to ruin him.
You wouldn't go after a guy
you thought raped your daughter?
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!
l've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep mucking around...
...and she's gonna sue us
for invasion of privacy.
So get out of these people's lives!
Hey! Ray!
-Hey! Am l getting through?
-You think this is just about money?
About us looking stupid?
Question him.
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.
Give him something to do.
-Look into the Kennedy assassination.
-l understand.
Next time this fucking piece of shit...
...drags me down here,
l'm gonna sue you.
You're goddamn lucky
l didn't sue last time.
-l agree.
-Am l free to go?
-Yes.
-Thank you.
-Cocksucker.
-Yeah, what was that?
-You heard me, motherfucker.
-Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?
What are you looking at?
-l guess l kind of lost it out there.
-You could say that.
Were you ever in a situation
where you saw something coming...
...and you didn't do
what you could to stop it?
We all have.
l mean something bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...
...and you--
You didn't do anything, and....
l did that once.
l don't wanna do it again.
l thought we were going to a movie.
l think we just need to get wasted.
Yeah.
Come on.
l wanna live at the beach someday.
Oh, shit.
l left the keys.
l'll get them.
Kelly?
Suzie.
lt's me.
l was worried about you,
and l decided...
...the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.
-Are you mad at me?
-No, no.
l probably should've told you
a bit more about...
...the part l intended to play.
But we'll go through it again tonight.
This is a celebration, Suzie,
not a suicide pact.
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...
...have a little champagne...
...watch the stars....
Kelly?
You got a blanket in the back
of your mom's Rover?
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it for us?
Good girl.
Let me tell you about the boat
l picked out for us.
You okay?
My mom would kill me
if she knew l took the Rover.
Been four-wheeling?
-Get off my property!
-l'm not on your property.
-lf you don't get out of here--
-You'll call a cop? l am a cop!
Goddamn it!
So you say she didn't
come home last night.
She's been talking about going to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.
Found some teeth in an old trailer
down the road.
He says they'll fit.
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.
Oh, and now they're saying
that she can't graduate.
lt is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her
into this whole mess, and you know it.
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.
We find something,
you'll be the first to know.
Come on.
lt's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.
Ray, we don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.
l'll drop you off.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.
You got someplace you wanna be?
-You got a date?
-Just check the car out for me.
lt's over here, by that old boat.
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?
Yeah, sometimes.
A lot of the kids hang out here.
You really think something bad
happened to Suzie?
Lombardo ever come out here?
l say something funny?
No, but l mean, just the idea
that Mr. Lombardo would--
Well, the way l heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.
You and him were pals, right?
Yeah, but he got me
onto the sailing team.
Told me l could work my way
through college, like he did.
Sam Lombardo went to the University
of Miami on an athletic scholarship.
Boats didn't have a damn thing
to do with it.
Listen, l'm gonna be here a while, kid.
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?
Hey, Jimmy.
People aren't always what they
appear to be. Don't forget that.
-This is where they did it.
-Where's the body?
The swamp, most likely.
Guy's a swamp rat.
He knows it won't be found,
but he made a mistake.
She'd been threatening to run away
and l found the car at the bus terminal.
You don't think Sam put it there?
Hold on a second.
Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.
Little sociopath's the one
who started this.
-How long till we get something?
-We can get blood type now.
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.
Poor, dumb Suzie.
Kid never had a chance.
-We don't know that.
-l'm telling you, Kelly's next.
l'm telling you, you get
off this right now.
Don't even fucking let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.
David!
You get an lD, you call me!
Will you do me a favor?
Ray, you heard him.
He told me to stay away.
He didn't say anything about you.
What if l'm right and Hunter's wrong?
Please, you gotta help me out
on this, partner.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?
lf l'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.
-Hello?
-I've been calling you.
-l wanna see you.
-Where are you?
-The stupid guest house.
-Good. Stay there.
Sam, l'm really nervous.
Kelly, relax.
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.
ln a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.
But what if they find out?
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.
Look, Kelly...
...stay in the guest house,
skip the graduation parties.
l love you so much.
And I love you too, Kelly.
Be a good girl
and stay where you are.
Peeping in people's windows?
lsn't that against the law?
Suzie Toller's missing.
-Since when?
-She didn't come home last night.
We found her car
at the bus terminal.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Well, l don't know what to tell you.
You could tell me
where you were last night.
l suppose l could,
but l don't really have to, now, do l?
Come here.
l wanna show you something.
Looks like goodbye.
Kelly's file.
Read it. You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...
...who threatened the lives
of at least two people.
What two people?
One of them was her mother.
The other one was...
...a female classmate...
...she may have been
sexually involved with.
Suzie?
Now you got the file.
Read it.
l think it'll give you a new
perspective on things.
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?
Because then l had principles.
That meant a lot to me.
Now...
...l don't care.
l should probably go now.
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.
-Duquette. What's happening?
-I'm tired. I'm going home.
-Where's Lombardo?
-He's gone.
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Let me tell you something, Ray:
There's more to this story
than you know.
If Suzie is dead...
...Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.
Ray?
Shit, Ray.
-Who is it?
-lt's Detective Duquette.
Open the gate, now.
-Hello, Kelly.
-What are you doing here?
Where's--? Kelly! Kelly!
l just looked away for a second,
just a split second.
And just like that, bingo...
...she put a knee in my groin.
l didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...
...just enough.
l couldn't get to her.
She turned on me with the gun.
Fired one shot.
l took the hit in the shoulder.
l had no choice.
l had to return fire.
Two rounds, l think,
in the chest.
l went there to protect her.
l went-- l went there to protect her.
Detective Duquette.
l spent time in military intelligence,
and we had a saying there:
''Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.
Three times is enemy action.''
This is twice for you, Duquette...
...and l intend to see to it
that there is no third time.
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.
Consequently,
two young women are dead.
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.
Chief Goodsall...
...Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...
...near the area known as
Stoner Beach.
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.
This has led this office to conclude...
...that Susan Marie Toller was
murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.
She--
She didn't.
Mr. Duquette.
Mr. Duquette.
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.
Thank you, Paul.
Howdy, partner.
Jesus, man. l wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.
The bitch shot me.
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?
You know, shoot them
in the leg or something?
Did you become squeamish
about this stuff before or after...
...you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
lt wasn't part of the plan.
lt couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.
l couldn't talk them out of it.
l'm telling you,
l don't like surprises.
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Now there's no loose ends.
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...
...l spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...
...to make the transfer, so....
-Bullshit.
-Oh, yeah.
Call them yourself.
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.
We'll take out the boat.
l just had it outfitted.
l could use a deck hand.
Here's to large bank accounts.
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.
To large accounts
and no loose ends.
And no loose ends.
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.
-You mean that thing?
-Yeah, Ray.
We call it a winch.
lt's what we use to tighten the sails.
-So why don't you start cranking?
-This is supposed to be a vacation.
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?
Come on, Ray.
l'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Or get me drowned.
lt's stuck.
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Put a little elbow grease in it.
lt's stuck, l'm telling you.
The jenny sheet must be
caught on something.
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?
-l don't understand a word you said.
-Okay, Ray.
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...
...and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.
You're killing me.
-You mean this thing?
-That's it. That one right there.
You see anything?
Look a little lower.
That's it.
Guess l forgot to tell you, Ray:
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.
First rule of sailing.
Ray!
-What happened?
-Nice try, motherfucker!
You!
You're dead!
No, l'm not.
Sam.
-Sam, for chrissake!
-Sorry, partner.
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.
You shouldn't have killed that kid
out in the glades either.
-What was his name?
-Davy.
That's my son, Walter.
He's been doing this a long time,
so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.
Thank you so much
for coming down to the glades.
Did you come here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?
No. Actually, it's my day off.
l thought you looked different.
l came because l was hoping
you would talk to me.
About Suzie?
Actually, l was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.
He used to come around here.
He had a thing going
with one of the girls--
Girls. Over at the glades.
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what l hear.
-She still work there?
-Not after that night.
All l know is, the next morning...
...she was gone and a boy was dead.
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.
Caught Ray slapping her around,
and he tried to stop it.
So Ray killed him.
Suzie saw it.
So he busted her and sent her up.
You know, just to prove that he could.
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.
To Ray.
We won. Sam, it's over.
Wow. Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before l can get rid of you.
Okay, Toller.
l wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.
-Fuck the winch. l wanna drive.
-lt doesn't work that way.
You don't drive it, you sail it.
Now, get on that winch.
l just wanna cruise for a while.
That's funny. That's one of the first
things l noticed about you, Sam.
You like to cruise.
-Suzie.
-Take college, for instance.
l bet the classes you took were ones
where the finals were multiple choice.
And you never bought the book.
You'd find a girl to loan you hers.
And then, of course, you'd have
to fuck her after that, right?
ls that how it went?
Yeah.
Well, l've got a good pop quiz for you.
Multiple choice, of course.
Before sailing on the Helios...
...Medea killed King Creon
and the princess with what?
A rock?
A spear gun?
Or a little poison?
Poison!
Good guess.
Van Ryan got old.
He and his cronies would come here.
Hunt and whore.
They acted like a bunch of assholes.
One trip, he showed up with this girl...
...he'd picked up somewhere.
Gotten her pregnant.
Dumped her in the swamp.
Poor girl was dead in a year.
That came with her.
And the child?
Well, she had it.
Before she drank herself to death.
Wasn't exactly a love child.
So you're not her grandmother.
l raised her like l was.
But, no. Walt was my only child.
He was a good boy.
Until the Army took him.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan
were half sisters.
And the other girl, Kelly?
Suzie's niece.
Well, it may be good news or not.
I don't know. We'll start with the letter.
-H.
-Yes, there are two H's.
Nice truck.
Selling your boat?
This was Suzie's boat.
Guess she won't be needing it now.
Funny. l wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her lQ was way up there.
Around 200 or some such shit.
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.
Hi.
What are you doing out here?
l'm running away.
You think that's wise?
Guess what else?
l have toys.
l suppose one taste won't hurt.
You know...
...that weekend l got busted,
l called you about a hundred times.
l really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.
Was l naive.
l can't decide what came out better.
That little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dildo shoved up her ass.
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Seems to like the same places you do.
-Funny you never met.
-Yeah, real funny.
You know, you're wrong about this,
and l could get busted on the spot.
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it.
Especially the part about killing me.
Now, get out of here.
Go make yourself a new friend.
What are you drinking?
We gotta stop. l'm gonna come.
That never seemed
to worry you at the glades.
-That's not your line....
-Say you love me.
l love you.
Now, give me the line.
No little girl can ever make me come.
You got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the evidence.
Oh, for chrissake.
-Hello, Kelly.
-What are you doing here?
May l ask you a question, Ms. Toller?
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?
l hope l never make you mad.
Cash is just walking-around money.
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...
...minus the million we set aside
for Ruby and Walter...
...less my usual fee.
Case closed.
Suzie.
Be good.
