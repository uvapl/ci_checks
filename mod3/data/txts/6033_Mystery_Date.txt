-Hello?
-Craig.
I saw her again,
at the beach this time.
-Who?
-Her.
-Her?
-Her her.
Right, the mystery girl.
You followed her to
the beach this time.
No. She just appeared.
I looked over,
and there she was.
On her upper lip,
there was this tiny bead of sweat.
It was her only flaw,
and I loved her for it.
All right. What did you do?
How did you, Tom McHugh,
take control of the situation?
How did you seize the moment
and make it your's?
I waited.
You waited. For what?
For the perfect moment.
For the moment our
eye's would meet...
... she'd smile at me...
...and there'd be a flash of unspoken
understanding between us.
I was waiting for fate.
Tell me something, Tom.
How long does all this take?
Hey, don't rush me.
When the moment's right, I'll know.
It'll happen.
-The landscapers come?
-On Wednesday.
Dr. Lusky. Mrs. Lusky.
Why, Craig McHugh!
I thought you were still in law school.
Tom. Craig's win some younger brother.
Well, you win some, you lose some.
Remind me to never let you operate on me.
Suzette, this is my son Tom.
Hi, Tom.
Tom's going to Yale to study business.
Or I might be joining the Merchant Marines.
I haven't really decided.
I say, take a couple of years,
figure out what to do with the rest of your life.
You know, I admire that, Tom.
A young man should follow his heart
where it takes him.
Don't let us old coots dictate
what you should or shouldn't do.
Of course, as an employer...
...I've always had a certain bias
against hiring slack-offs.
As you all know, by this time tomorrow,
Betty and I will be in Connecticut...
...with a very special
member of our family.
Hear, hear.
For the past four years, he's competed
amongst the best our nation has had to offer...
...and each time he's
come home a champion.
And I know how grateful he is
for your generous support.
But I think he could probably say it
a lot more eloquently than I.
What do you say, champ?
"For he's a jolly good schnauzer
"For he's a jolly good schnauzer
"For he's a jolly good schnauzer
"Which nobody can deny
"Which nobody can deny..."
Saratoga Long shot?
There's got to be a way
to find out more about her.
Hello?
Hi, Mom.
No, I cancelled.
I know he's a doctor,
but he's still boring.
Well, then you go
out with him.
To tell you the truth,
I'd rather be by myself.
Hang on a second.
I think I heard something outside.
Okay, there's a couple of frozen pizzas
in the icebox downstairs...
...and a fresh case of
Bock beer, all right?
Keep your damn hands off it.
Yes, sir.
Now, don't forget about that
list of chores we agreed on.
Please, Tom, get yourself
a nice haircut, dear.
See you when you get back.
-You bet.
-Okay.
Buckle up, hon.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Mom, I'm not going to kiss the dog.
Goodbye, dear.
"Clean your room.
"Hang up the clothes.
Mow the lawn."
Craig!
Hey, butthead.
Thought you were in California.
After talking to everybody,
I decided to fly up and surprise you.
No kidding.
We haven't seen you in ages.
You know Mom and Dad
took off, right?
-Yeah. When are they coming
back anyway? -Monday night.
Terrific.
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
1959 DeSoto Firesweep.
You see the way it sort
of leans into the wind?
That's called the
"Forward Look."
When this baby came out, the ad said,
"Suddenly, it's 1960!"
Hey, you want to take
it for a spin?
Can I?
No, but I will let you
pull it into the garage.
It's a push-button transmission.
"D" for drive, "R" for reverse.
Where's the "P"?
No park. Parking brake.
Wait a minute. How did you get
it up here if you just flew in?
How did you get the car here
if you just flew in from California?
I let Chris Keslin drive it up during Spring
Break, met me at the airport. Grab that bag.
Any beer inside? You certainly
look like you could use one.
Yeah, but Dad said...
"Keep your damn hands off it."
Forget it. Tell him I drank it.
It's good to see you, Craig.
I see you've been putting
my telescope to good use.
Tom!
Is it inadvertently pointing at
something interesting?
Is this the one you've been telling me about,
your new girlfriend?
I'm working on that.
Tommy, come here.
I want you to look through
this telescope. Go ahead.
It's pointed at a beautiful woman.
Why?
Because you pointed it there.
Not Mom, not Dad,
not anybody else but you.
You know what you want. The hard part is over.
You have to do something about it.
-Craig, I haven't even spoken to her.
-That's all right.
That's all right.
What do you know about this girl?
She's housesitting for
some new neighbors.
She reads mystery novels,
she doesn't seem to have a boyfriend.
Tom, she's waiting for you.
Well, fine. I'll just go over there and say,
"I'm Tom. You don't know me.
"I've been spying on
you for months now.
"And I find you attractive
in a very real, very hormonal way."
And then she'll slap me silly.
There are worse things in this world than
getting slapped by a beautiful woman.
-Hey, you got her number?
-Craig, I don't even know her name.
But you've got her garbage, right?
She's got a couple of Gourmet Lights,
couscous, a bunch of grapefruit rinds.
Tommy, you got to get
this girl some food.
Hello.
Tom, I'd like you to
meet Geena Mathews.
In July, Geena bought $85 worth
of lingerie at Nordstrom.
Very nice. You like lingerie, Tommy?
Well, I've really only read about it.
All right, let's see. She reads
mystery novels to escape, right?
She dreams of faraway,
exotic places.
She's into surrealism.
She's trapped, Tom.
Bingo.
She plays bingo?
Phone bill. Now we have
her phone number.
Let's go rescue her.
Craig...
No, I can't do this.
-Just be yourself.
-No, I can't.
-Then be me.
-No.
Hello?
Hello, Geena?
Is this Geena Mathews?
Hi, my name is Tom.
No, no. Tom McHugh.
That's because we've never met.
I'm a neighbor of yours.
I live over on Sunnydale.
I don't name the streets,
I just live on them.
Listen, I keep seeing you
everywhere I go.
First it was at Nordstrom,
and then the beach.
And then at that Dali exhibit
over at the museum.
I had to call to ask you to please
stop following me around.
I mean, people are really
starting to talk.
You know, us.
Listen, Geena...
To be totally honest with you,
I'm trying my hardest to ask you out.
But it's going to be
a beautiful night.
It's gonna be one of those...
...hot, tropical nights
where anything could happen.
I fly back to California tomorrow.
Listen, what about this?
What if I just show up
at your house at 7:30?
If you don't open the door, I'll go home.
I promise. What do you say?
Great.
Bye.
We're in.
I'm not going to do this.
Call her back.
Do what? Now all you
have to do is show up.
What if I blow it? This is way too
spontaneous. I need more time.
Tiger, come on.
All right, relax.
Trust me. You'll be ready.
Now, I want you to just remember
what Lord Olivier said about acting.
"The key is sincerity.
"Once you can fake that,
the rest is easy."
George Burns said that.
Okay, I want you to clean it up,
but not too severe.
Think Robert Mitchum...
...in 'Out of the Past.'
So basically,
exactly like yours, right?
Yeah.
Craig, you don't understand.
First dates don't work for me.
I hurry my jokes.
I have car trouble.
Once, I bit some pizza
and all the hot stuff slid off...
...hit me in the chin and gave
me second-degree burns.
You're trying too hard.
Let her do the work.
What do women like to do more
than anything else in the world?
Buy shoes?
Talk. They talk, so you listen.
That is the single most important thing
I can tell you about women.
They like it when you treat them
shitty or treat them well.
They just want you
to pay attention.
Watch.
Does it matter that I have 20-20 vision?
I don't need glasses.
Neither do I.
You know how women sometimes say
they like guys who are mature?
That means they like
a man with glasses.
No kidding.
It's the only difference.
The only problem with glasses is that they
tend to fly off when a woman slaps you.
Just don't flinch. Take it like a man.
Come off it smiling.
I don't usually get slapped.
Really?
Happens to me all the time.
Come on.
A limo? Craig, there's no way
I'm going to show up in some stupid limo.
On a night like tonight,
your convertible would be perfect.
I promise I'll be extra-careful.
You're right.
It would be very cool.
But I can't. Really, Tom, it's been
giving me all sorts of trouble lately.
The top sticks,
the exhaust system.
Why risk it?
In fact, I was hoping
to borrow your car.
My car?
Yeah, visit some of
my old hangouts.
Everything at Kory's is terrific,
except for the wine list.
Just dismiss it with a wave of your hand
and say, "A bottle of your best champagne."
"A bottle of your best champagne"?
How am I supposed to afford that?
This is brand new.
You sign my name,
so that the signatures will match.
And I will give you some
extra cash for tipping.
Always tip well.
But only when your
date is watching.
Hi. I have a flower
delivery for a Mr...
...McHugh?
Twenty minutes late, Dwight.
I'm sorry, sir. I guess I misjudged the ride over.
I usually take a different route.
That is a beautiful car.
Don't make excuses on my time.
I have an important date planned this evening,
and now you just fucked it up.
I said I was sorry.
Well, there goes your tip, Dwight.
There goes my tip?
Well, I hope you
enjoy the flowers...
...Craig!
This is insane.
What if she hates me? What if she laughs
at me? What if she pulls a knife?
Pulls a knife?
Worst case scenario.
Relax.
Just stick to the plan,
and everything's gonna be fine.
The last thing a woman wants to hear is,
"I don't know. What do you want to do?"
You have reservations, you have directions,
everything's taken care of.
You need to wear this jacket.
You think so?
All right.
Oh, no! Don't do this to me.
I'm sorry, man! I'm really late!
Hey, come back here!
This is inspiring.
You look almost like me.
It's perverse.
I got to get going.
My wallet's in here.
You hold on to that.
There's some extra cash, and my ID,
in case you get carded.
Phony ID?
Isn't that against the law, Craig?
Never let the law stand in
the way of a good time.
You're gonna make a
great lawyer, Craig.
You're a good brother.
Yes?
-Mr. McHugh?
-Yes!
About that limousine you ordered.
There's been a slight accident.
We can get you another one,
but it'll take a few hours.
No, you don't understand.
Tonight's a special occasion.
Of course it is, otherwise you
would have rented a Chevette.
But I have to pick her up in a few minutes!
Now what am I supposed to do?
McHugh. Tom McHugh.
Hi.
-You're Tom?
-I'm Tom.
These are flowers.
They're for you.
I'll go put them in water.
Just the bottom part.
Listen, thanks for the flowers.
They're really great.
But I'll ask you some questions
before I open the door.
Right, of course.
I understand.
Tell me the name of the last novel
you actually read.
Novel?
A big storybook without pictures.
Oh, right.
It's just that it was...
It was this mystery novel,
Saratoga Long shot.
Are you kidding?
I just read that.
Really?
Okay, what's the
capital of Paraguay?
Uruguay?
It's Asunción. But nobody
ever gets that one.
Any personal heroes?
I always looked up to my
older brother, Craig.
But that's kind of stupid.
That's so sweet. I mean,
most guys say Michael Jordan.
Wait. I'm sitting on something.
-This is a cool car.
-Thanks.
It's funny what guys think is impressive.
I had a date once that showed up in a limo.
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm serious.
I just think this is
more interesting.
It's a 1959...
...DeSoto.
-DeSoto?
-Yeah.
Yeah, when it first came out...
By the way,
where are we going?
It's just up ahead here.
I'm pretty sure.
It's a place called Kory's.
How did you find this place?
I don't know. You just hear
about places and then...
...you go there.
I forgot what I was going to say.
It was something really enchanting.
Maybe we should skip this first
impression thing. What do you say?
Great idea.
I've always felt fourth impressions,
you know, were really the most important.
On first dates people try so hard,
they really can't be themselves.
Yeah, I know.
It's almost deceptive, really,
if you think about it.
We spend hours making ourselves
look completely different...
...then we go someplace dark where
we can't see each other anyway.
And we drink, so we don't know if
the other person is really interesting...
...or just seems so because they're pretending
to be interested in who we're pretending to be.
Right.
I guess there's no
getting around it.
We're gonna have to
lie to each other.
Lie to each other?
At least until we get
to know one another.
Two Cabana Coolers.
I'll just put that on your tab.
-Tab?
-Yeah.
My tab, right, okay.
Thank you, Stella.
Now I've wet myself...
...and you're going to want to
call my mother to take me home.
Tom, I think it's all right.
If this is the worst thing that happens
all night, I think we're going to live.
I'm going to be right back.
Hi, Stella.
-Hi.
-Do you have a towel?
I see the old McHugh charm
is overflowing this evening.
Stella!
Duty calls. I live to serve.
-That wasn't Craig McHugh, was it?
-Get in line, honey.
It's his car, all right.
No mistaking it.
I'm going to check it out.
How are you this evening?
-Beautiful car.
-Thank you.
So, the rat returns to his hole.
Do we know each other?
I wasn't that drunk!
How you can live with yourself,
Craig McHugh...
I don't... I mean... I'm not...
Mr. Romeo.
I hate dicks like you.
What did he do, Susie?
Forget it, Aldo. His karma
will catch up with him.
She's right, Aldo. And when it does,
it's going to kick my ass.
Do you like your drink?
-Yeah, it's kind of...
-Could you tell me in the car?
What's the big hurry?
I ran into some old school
buddies of mine.
They'll be bugging us all night
if we hang around.
I thought that was a great place.
-You mind if we go someplace else?
-No, that's fine.
These guys, they're...
...kooks.
Interesting friends.
Well, you know,
they're just jealous.
Here I am, out with a beautiful
Pulitzer Prize winner.
Come on, Tom.
Enough with the lies, okay?
Absolutely.
No more lies.
Tom, what happened to
your face? It's all red.
That! It's...
It's an allergic reaction
to pineapple juice.
Are those your buddies again?
I think he's from the flower
shop near my house.
-Did you screw her yet?
-What?
Did you get her drunk with
my tip money and bang her?
-What did he say?
-I didn't catch it.
Here!
Bang her with these!
I still can't hear him!
Hey, lady!
I hope you don't expect
a tip after you...
He was kind of funny,
wasn't he?
I had no idea you were such a romantic.
Or do you throw flowers at all your dates?
I can't wait to see what
you throw at me next.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Is there a washroom?
Nice form.
-Nice car.
-Thanks.
-'58.
-'59. DeSoto Firesweep.
You look great with it,
too, you know?
-Could you do something for me?
-What's that?
Just kind of...
...lean against it there.
-What, like this?
-Yeah. That's great.
Now put the other
hand right there.
-Like this?
-Perfect.
Don't move. I'm Detective Condon.
I will be your arresting officer this evening.
Is this a joke?
The joke is over, son.
So you're Craig McHugh.
No, I'm not. He's my brother.
Your evil twin brother, right?
No, he's older.
An older evil...
My brother's practically
a lawyer, okay?
You'll need one.
-That you, Sharpie? It's Condon.
-Did somebody say "condom"?
Go ahead and make your stupid jokes.
I got him. I got McHugh.
I said to wait for backup.
What's with you?
He's not even armed.
He's practically crying.
I want you to wait there, understand?
We're on our way.
Okay, McHugh...
...time to hand over
the flowerpot.
I got flowers.
I want it now. I got no
time for this crap.
We know you took the vase.
Now, where is it? The trunk?
You look in the trunk, take whatever
you want. You got the jack...
Hello?
Sir?
Hi. Is everything all right?
Yeah.
You look kind of pale.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Good.
Because I'm having
a great time.
You are?
Yeah.
I hate to cut our date short.
I mean, with you going to California
tomorrow and everything, right?
Yeah, right.
You see, it's just that...
...I'm a little worried about...
...my car.
I've been having some
car trouble.
I'll go pay, okay?
Did you forget something?
No, that's okay. I got it.
Can I help?
I had a nosebleed.
That's disgusting.
Keep the change.
Do you have a pay phone?
On the wall.
-Hi, I'm Richard.
-I'm Betty.
And that was Napoleon.
We're not home, but if you
leave your name and number...
...we'll call you back
just as soon as we can.
Craig, are you there?
Pick up the phone, okay?
Shit.
Listen, I had to borrow your car.
The stupid limo didn't show up.
All hell's breaking loose, man.
I have two dead bodies
in the trunk.
I think I should call the police,
you know, but I can't.
Because one of them,
I personally, accidentally killed.
I've been slapped,
I've been threatened by goons.
I've been attacked by a
freaking florist, okay?
And we haven't even
ordered appetizers.
You said something
about old hangouts.
Meet me at a place called Club Voltaire,
if you're not already there, okay?
See you there. Bye.
The flowers were a great surprise.
I can't wait to see what you'll do next.
Next?
It's another surprise.
Hey, you dick!
Six months ago,
I thought this place was too yuppie.
You know what they do to cop killers,
flower boy?
The lucky ones live to see the chair.
You don't look that lucky to me!
I keep telling you.
I never saw McHugh until he
stiffed me for the flowers.
He tried to run me off
the road. It's the truth.
-Sharpie.
-What?
I tracked down the kid's boss.
Guess his story checks out.
Are you sure?
I got the address where
he made the delivery.
Poor Al never had a chance.
Let's go get that cop killer.
Listen, Geena, I'm really sorry.
-I thought my brother was here.
-No, it's incredible!
I thought we were
going to get killed!
Well, the night is
still young.
Bottle of your best
champagne.
Anything else?
That'll be fine.
Couple of Gourmet Lights, couscous.
Bunch of grapefruit rinds.
Don't these people
eat anything?
-Sir?
-Yeah.
The search warrant
you asked for.
Good boy.
-Sharpie.
-What?
Listen to this.
-What do you got?
-Listen to this.
I have two dead bodie's
in the trunk.
I think I should call the police,
you know, but I can't.
Because one of them,
I personally, accidentally killed.
If that isn't a confession,
I don't know what is.
There's more.
You said something
about old hangouts.
I'm going to a place
called Club Voltaire.
Meet me there, okay?
Two dead bodies?
That voice was creepy.
Not anounce of remorse.
Anything else, Mr. McHugh?
No, thanks.
Craig McHugh?
Why? Do I know you?
No.
But you know my sister.
I don't even look
like my brother.
Yes, you do. I see it.
You sort of dress
like him, too.
-Thought you stole his credit card.
-You know my brother? Have you seen him?
Upstairs. Chinese guy.
Your boyfriend said to tell you
he'd be right back.
Why? Where'd he go?
Upstairs.
To find his brother.
Thanks.
Hello?
Craig?
If you'd like to make a call,
plea se, hang up and try again.
If you need help, hang up and
then dial your operator.
Tom, is that you?
No.
Are you okay?
Don't come in!
It's a real mess in here!
What's going on?
I'm coming in, Tom.
No! No, hold on!
What is this?
What's going on?
Are you hungry? Let's
get some Chinese food.
Nervous? Am I acting nervous?
I don't think I'm acting nervous.
You're acting like
you have rabies.
Tom, why did you
disappear like that?
That's pretty rude.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I thought my brother might be upstairs,
visiting a friend, but he wasn't there.
Maybe I wanted to meet him.
You said he was your hero, right?
Under the circumstances,
that wouldn't be a good idea.
What circumstances?
-Circumstances beyond my control.
-I don't understand what that means.
I know this is just
another night to you...
...but it's really important
to me, all right?
Tom, you're a really
nice guy, but...
"Nice."
I'm afraid that's my
one and only quality.
No, that's not true. You have
one or two other qualities.
I do?
Yeah, you're spontaneous.
And you're sincere.
You have great taste.
That's somebody else. I'm just
doing that so you won't ditch me.
Besides, you forgot "funny."
I am funny. Right?
Yes, you are funny.
Excuse me.
Is this your vehicle?
Yes, it is.
Is there a problem, officer?
You're missing a tire.
Give me the keys.
I'll help you with the spare.
You could lose anything
around here.
Why don't you watch this?
I'm going to go get the spare.
These old jacks,
they get wiggly.
That's a leaky flare.
I'll get this one,
you go close that trunk.
Have a nice night, now.
Stop!
Come here.
Looks like I caught
you just in time.
Take a look at this.
It's oil, huh?
That ain't oil.
I'd say that was...
...transmission fluid.
When it gets all red
and sticky like this...
...it's time to have
it changed.
I'll change it.
How about some music?
Something relaxing?
Tom, they took your tapes.
They took my tapes?
Well, this is relaxing.
Driving in eerie silence.
What was that?
Was that a car phone?
No.
Sounds like it's coming
from the trunk.
It's a trunk car phone. One of these
jobbies that you put in the trunk...
...then it doesn't bother
you while you drive.
Don't you think you
should answer it?
Yes, I should.
Craig McHugh was here,
all right. With a date.
I don't get it. He kills a cop,
then goes out and celebrates? What next?
There's a dead Chinese
man upstairs.
Looks like McHugh was the
last person to see him alive.
This guy's over the edge.
He's a psycho, all right.
I mean, who else would steal from
the head of the Chinese Tong Mafia?
Boy, there sure aren't many
Chinese people around.
I guess it gets a little touristy
on Saturday nights.
Chinese are probably inside,
making a living.
Look at this place.
We should go in here.
All right.
You go in.
I'm going to ask some people to
recommend a good place to eat.
No public washroom.
No customer use.
I wanted to see you.
Me? No. You go away.
Go to Happy Moon piano bar.
Find nice boy there.
Some nice young man there.
My shirt. I need to know
what my shirt says.
Written backwards.
"Look in pot."
Oi, vay! No, no. "Look in pot"
is old Chinese proverb.
-An old proverb?
-Yes.
It's about a young man.
Very poor.
But he inherits a
pot from his uncle.
It's very beautiful.
He take pot...
...he shows it to neighbor.
"Look how beautiful."
He shines it up,
he puts it up on shelf.
He never looks inside!
See, he never realized inside...
...full of gold!
So he starved...
...never knowing he's so rich.
You would have thought it would have
jingled around when he moved it.
Proverb. Always look
inside of beauty.
Pot is only as good as
what is inside of it.
Thank you.
An adventure is in the air...
...like a wind from
a faraway place.
Fortunes made and lost.
Men in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
Lives changing.
All because your loins
led you out tonight.
It was not my loins.
I was curious.
In women, curiosity is an urge
that springs from the loins.
But not in men?
In men, everything is an urge
that springs from the loins.
Speaking of the devil.
This is the one who needs
his fortune told.
Tell me his deepest,
darkest secrets.
Young man,
you are an imposter.
Look at the time.
We've got to go.
-How much do we owe you?
-Sit down. It's free!
Take $20, keep the change.
Beware! Beware of
your false self!
Who knows what I would
have found out about you?
There's something
I've got to tell you.
Mr. McHugh,
your table is waiting.
We're really not that hungry.
Mr. Lew would like you
to be his guests for dinner.
We could eat.
While officials are refusing to call it
a murder spree, two men are dead.
And McHugh is believed to be armed,
and very dangerous.
Thank you.
Boy, am I starving.
We need to get out of here. Now.
Why? You don't like
this place?
A bottle of your best...
...champagne.
Compliments of Mr. Lew.
I'd like to propose a toast.
It's not really a toast.
I just...
Would you promise me another chance
if I really blow it tonight?
You're doing fine. Really.
How do you know
this Mr. Lew?
I don't.
You see, this is a
misunderstanding.
He knows my brother,
and I don't think he likes him.
And you know how,
when you don't like somebody...
...you kind of don't like
their whole family?
What I'm trying to say is,
I don't think...
...Lew brought us here
to serve us dinner.
Your dinner,
compliments of Mr. Lew.
Could be dangerous.
At the very least, he's not going
to be a very congenial host.
Peking duck,
our house specialty.
If you require anything else...
...food, drink...
...additional companions...
...anything at all,
please don't hesitate to ask.
Your money is no good here.
Let me put it another way.
You know, I probably should
have said this before...
...but I think he wants
to kill us.
What, with MSG?
No, I'm not kidding.
I'd feel a lot better if
we just got out of here.
Wait a minute. You said yourself,
this was just some big misunderstanding.
Why don't you get hold of your brother
and find out what's going on?
That's what I've
been trying to do.
Maybe I should try him again.
I'll be right back.
We'll call you back just
as soon as we can.
Craig, are you there?
Pick up the phone.
All right, listen.
I'm at a restaurant called Chez Lew,
in Chinatown.
Get here, okay? Now!
Let's see.
Maybe he called in.
That's strange.
Call Sharpie. Tell him
we've got his location.
McHugh!
I hope you don't mind.
I've taken the liberty of introducing
myself to your lovely companion.
At last we meet.
You're different than I imagined.
Thanks, I...
Lew? Mr. Lew?
James Lew.
I hope you're enjoying
your meal.
May I join you?
Yeah, sure!
This is a really great
place you have, James.
So.
It seems we share
many interests.
Beautiful women.
Exotic cars.
Manchurian vases of the
late 16th century.
Right. I just saw an article
on your collection.
You read.
Then you know how valuable
some of those vases can be.
Actually, it's funny...
...because just today
I heard a proverb about vases.
Actually, it's about a pot.
It's about this really poor guy...
...who gets this pot
from his uncle...
I know the proverb.
I don't.
What's it about?
It says,
"Always look inside the pot."
And this is just my
interpretation, but...
...shake it up every now and then
to see if there's any money in it.
So now it's money
you're after.
Only yesterday, you were begging
me to spare your life.
We made a deal, McHugh.
Deal?
What's he talking about?
You see, I'm not the guy
you made the deal with.
I'm not Craig McHugh.
He's my brother.
Let me guess. Your evil
twin brother, right?
Where is it?
Where is my vase?
Listen...
...McHugh...
...I've been cutting you
a lot of slack.
I've not held you accountable
for Ho Wong's accident...
...because I like you.
Did you know that he killed
my cousin Ho Wong?
It's our first date. We haven't had a
lot of time to open up to each other.
He's modest.
He told me it was all
in self-defense.
Fine.
I understand.
I guess he was probably sent to kill you
in the first place anyway, come to think of it.
But, Mr. McHugh...
...enough is enough.
Don't you realize who
you're dealing with here?
Don't you know that...
...you will never leave
this restaurant alive...
...unless you return
my property?
Tell him you're not Craig.
What the heck is
your problem?
Hey, everybody,
it's Mr. Lew's birthday!
It's Mr. Lew's birthday!
What are you doing?
The police are here.
We can't go to the police.
They'll arrest me.
Fine!
They'll arrest me because
they think I'm Craig.
I'm wearing Craig's suit.
-You're wearing his suit?
-And I'm driving his car.
I'm paying for things with his credit cards.
Everybody thinks I'm Craig.
Well, gee, I wonder why?
Just stop the car, okay?
Would you stop the car?
Look, we're not gonna go anywhere until
you tell me exactly what's going on, okay?
Plenty of witnesses.
McHugh blew in here, threw a gala
party for Lew, then took off.
I didn't know McHugh
was your friend.
I didn't know you were
so eager to meet him.
Maybe we could all get together
sometime and go bowling.
All I know is that it's got something
to do with a vase that belongs to Lew.
And I think that
Craig might...
I think he stole it.
All those cops show up
because he stole a vase?
I don't know! Last time I knew him,
he was at Stanford becoming a lawyer.
Now he's stealing vases,
pissing off girls.
God knows what he was thinking
when he set up this stupid date.
Craig set up this date?
Wait a minute. It was
Craig who called me?
You know, I expect most guys
to lie about something.
How much they bench-press,
how many girls they've slept with...
...what they expect
out of a relationship.
But you've created an
alternate parallel universe.
I wanted to call you from
the first time I saw you.
But it was too important for me to
screw up by saying something stupid.
I just wanted to make
a good first impression.
That's the idea,
to cut through all of that...
...find out if there's anything
worthwhile on the inside.
"Look in the pot."
What?
The proverb, remember? I found
it in the loft above Club Voltaire.
It was a message for my brother.
A message.
Wait.
You know what that means,
don't you?
It's a metaphor.
Beauty is in the inside...
No! Look, it means that...
...whatever Lew wants is inside
this vase that Craig has.
"Look in the pot," right?
You're right.
I've got to find Craig.
Wait. What is this?
Still no answer.
I have an idea.
When I was in retail, there was a number
we used to verify phone numbers on checks.
We can get his address this way.
Yes.
555-1809. Craig McHugh.
2856 West Eastwood.
Great. Thanks.
Let's go meet your perfect
older brother.
It's McHugh.
Tell your boss I've got his
valuable family heirloom.
Yeah, I stole it back from
the people I sold it to.
It was even easier than stealing it
from you clowns.
And I've got an alibi,
so no tricks.
Yeah, whatever you say.
I'll make the delivery. You just
call off your leg-breakers.
You wouldn't want me to get nervous
and drop it, would you?
What a mess.
Whatever's inside that vase
must be pretty valuable.
Do you think they
missed anything?
They say you can learn a lot about
a person from their garbage.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Hey, wait.
Here's his phone bill.
He gets his calls forwarded
from California.
I'll be damned!
I can't believe he's been
here this whole time.
Wait, let's just think
about this, okay?
Whatever it is, it has to be
able to fit inside a vase.
Drugs, maybe?
The detective said it was
some kind of evidence.
Wait.
What detective?
At the gas station. This detective
came up and talked to me.
He thought I was Craig.
-And? -And he stopped
thinking I was Craig.
Why can't you just
be straight with me?
All night it's been, "We're looking
for Craig, he may be in trouble."
"And I should've mentioned,
for dessert, they're going to kill us!"
Listen. In the trunk...
...there's the phone.
-It was the detective's.
-You stole his phone?
No, he dropped it.
He dropped it.
It's kind of complicated.
Geena, I can't tell you
everything because...
...if I did, you'd leave.
Fine, don't bother,
because I'm leaving anyway.
What?
Craig McHugh,
how good to find you in.
I'm not Craig McHugh!
No, of course not.
You drive his car...
...you answer his phone,
but still, you're not him.
Listen to me!
I'm not Craig McHugh!
Nevertheless,
it's good to find you in.
This is a big mistake!
Come with me.
Get into the car.
Now, get in the car.
Get in it!
I'll tell you right now, Lew,
you don't know who you're dealing with.
You have until 2:00 a.m.
to return my property.
The pot for the girl.
You know where I live.
Could you just jog
my memory a little?
2:00 a.m., McHugh.
After that, I can't
guarantee her safety.
"But like Mick Jagger said,
'I can't get no satisfaction'
"The girls are all around
But none of them wanna get with me
"My friends are fresh,
and I'm looking def
"Yo, what's up with LOC?"
"Do exactly what your
big brother says."
"Stick to the plan, tiger."
Asshole!
You dick!
-What the hell was that?
-What the hell was what?
There's somebody in there.
Want me to tell Sharpie?
Tell him we got McHugh.
Oh, man.
Craig, I need that vase now!
Shut up!
I said, shut up!
They took the tapes.
They weren't after the vase.
They were after what
was inside the vase.
What was inside the vase...
...was a tape.
Look, Condon, I didn't complain
when you upped your price for protection.
I even gave you a bonus
when you took care of Scheski.
Now, why are my people
getting busted?
It's this anti-drug thing.
It's getting out of hand.
We gotta show results, Lew.
You want the FBI nosing around?
Condon, the detective.
All right, McHugh,
we know you're in there!
He's not in there!
All right, friends,
listen up.
Wilkins, Jesse!
You guys cover Sleepy Hollow!
Carver, Mitchell, Babbling Brook Way!
Hotchins, Romano, Bonny Meadow Lane!
Nixon, Lazy Bunny Hutch!
And don't anybody take any chances.
This is a war zone!
Damn it!
James Wo Chong Lew.
What a day. Your boyfriend
has caused me no end of grief.
He's not my boyfriend.
So there is a limit
to McHugh's charm.
Ben, Jerry, why don't you guys
go get some ice cream, okay?
Would you like anything?
Food? Something to drink?
This is kidnapping, you know.
You could get in a lot of trouble.
I don't want to talk business.
I am tired of business.
Let's try to relax.
I can't really relax while
I'm being held prisoner.
Sure you can.
You just need a little help.
Help me!
-Hi, Craig.
-Help me!
Help you? I could help you.
On the other hand, if I don't...
...all your friends,
family and neighbors...
...will have to call up and order
flowers for your funeral.
And I can make
a lot of money.
I could make a lot
of money on tips.
If I still had my job!
You stiffed me for my tip.
Fine.
That's okay.
You try to run me off
the road! No problem!
I'm a flower boy!
It all comes with
the territory!
What's your problem?
What's that?
Did you say something?
I can't hear you.
Take that thing out
of your mouth!
What's your problem?
You're my problem!
No problem.
No problem, man!
I'm fine!
I'm all right.
-What are you going to do about it?
-I want a divorce!
Hi.
I got a flower delivery
for Mr. Lew.
Flowers? At 2:00 in the morning?
Yeah. No kidding.
It's some kind of
an emergency.
Emergency flowers?
Hey, don't ask me, okay?
I think he wants to
impress some girl.
Okay. Right.
The girl.
Well, you better get
on up there then.
Thank you.
-Chalk one up for the good guys.
-Find the body?
Not yet, but the engineer
swears he hit him.
They found this
on the tracks.
Kill a cop, kiss a train.
Seems about right.
-Be so kind? -Let's see what
forensics has to say.
What do you got
for us, Katz?
Strange ruminations from
the trunk, I'm afraid.
The Chinese gentleman
was one Ho Wong...
...a hit man for our
friend James Lew.
He was waiting in the trunk
to kill Craig McHugh.
Fired a single round...
...through the trunk lid here...
...mistakenly felling peace officer
Albert Condon.
Wait a minute. That's got to be wrong.
McHugh killed Al!
Not so, my friend.
Ho Wong was our man.
He killed Officer Condon.
Judging by the leak
in the exhaust...
...I'd say Wong died
of asphyxiation.
No. McHugh is no killer.
2:30.
I'd say you were
being stood up.
Come on.
You wouldn't want them to show up
here and find me dead, right?
I don't think you realize how many
friends I have on the police force.
Please, sit down.
Look, I'm warning you, Lew.
If you do anything to me, you'll
never get that evidence you're after.
Evidence?
What evidence are
you talking about?
I know all about it.
The evidence in the pot.
So, McHugh did tell you.
That's too bad.
Yours will be honorable death, McHugh.
This sword has been in my family
for three centuries!
You asshole!
Honor?
I'll kill you with my bare hands!
Happy birthday, McHugh!
What the...
Are you all right?
-I'm fine.
-Good.
Damn it, Tom.
Or is it Craig?
No. It's Tom.
You promised me another chance
if I really blew it tonight.
You really blew it.
Hand it over, McHugh.
Hand over the tape, Craig.
Don't. Once you give him
the tape, he'll kill us.
I'll kill you anyway.
Do what you want with the window,
just leave the girl alone.
All right, Lew, one move
and I drop your precious pot.
Now, lose the gun.
Go ahead!
Your boyfriend stole everything
that was valuable.
He had a fence to tell
him which ones to take!
Check the rest of
the grounds!
Give me the tape.
I don't think so.
Now, who the heck are you?
I'm Craig McHugh.
Stop picking on my little brother,
or I drop your valuable family heirloom.
We tried that already.
Please.
He doesn't want the vase.
Trust me! He doesn't
want the vase, okay?
I should know more
about this than you.
Why do you think I made you my alibi?
Which, by the way, you fouled up royally.
You don't want the vase?
I have what I want.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to call the police.
A thief and his two accomplices were
found shot here in self-defense.
I made copies of that tape.
What tape?
-You're bluffing.
-I did.
I can prove it. Give me the phone.
Fifteen seconds.
No funny stuff, McHugh.
-Hi, I'm Richard.
-I'm Betty.
And that was Napoleon.
We're not home right now...
Look, Condon, I didn't complain when you
upped your price for protection.
I even gave you a bonus
when you took care of Scheski.
Now, why are my people
getting busted?
It's this anti-drug thing.
It's getting out of hand.
We gotta show results, Lew.
-You want the FBI no sing around?
-It's Condon.
Just lie low for a few months.
And we'll get together with Sharpie
and Doheny and work out a new deal.
Like I said, if the FBI gets wind of this,
we're all screwed.
Unbelievable.
They're all in on it.
If you don't like that copy,
I made others.
If we don't return home
safely tonight...
...I left instructions for the
tapes to be sent to the FBI.
No, wait.
Great. The police!
Great. The police.
Police. Nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt.
I'm glad you're here, sir.
This man wants to kill us in cold blood.
Is that right?
We have evidence that's
gonna put this guy away for life.
You found the tape?
He's got one, and I've got
another one at home.
Only two? So you were bluffing.
Kill him! Finish him off for me!
Earn your payoff money!
You're the payoff cops?
The payoff cops?
-This isn't fair.
-Shut up!
-Who is this guy?
-It's McHugh, you idiots! Now kill him!
I'm not Craig McHugh!
He's not Craig McHugh. I am!
-Positive, he's not Craig McHugh.
-Kill them both.
And the girl. One of them
is bound to be McHugh.
McHugh's already dead!
In fact, he died a hero.
One of your pals here
killed Al, Lew.
And then McHugh...
...killed him.
And then you...
You killed McHugh.
And now, Lew...
...I'm gonna kill you.
-Kill me?
-That's what I said!
You kill for me! I say who
kills who! Kill them!
And while you're at it,
kill yourself!
They're getting away!
Freeze!
Nobody move!
-Drop your weapons! You're under arrest!
-For what?
Bribery...
...extortion...
...and extreme stupidity.
Hey, why so glum?
You could thank me for
coming to your rescue.
Thanks, Craig.
Thanks for everything.
What the hell's your
problem, Tommy?
What's my problem?
I've spent my life being compared to my
perfect older brother, and you don't even exist.
-Oh, really? -You're a lying,
thieving, sociopathic criminal.
And I thought you were a lawyer.
Well, now we're splitting
hairs, aren't we?
Get out of here.
Take your $200 shoes.
Take your stupid shirt.
I don't want anyone else to mistake me
for the legendary asshole...
...Craig McHugh.
-You're an ingrate.
-Ingrate?
You almost got us killed.
I'm sorry.
I guess I screwed up.
I put adventure into your lives.
That's it. No, go on.
Go back to your safe, suburban homes...
...and lock your doors
and watch your MTV.
But I'll tell you this much.
When the two of you are old and you're
sitting on your fat, wrinkled asses...
...there's gonna be one night...
...one date out of your whole boring
lives that you're gonna remember...
...and it's gonna be tonight.
Don't tell Mom and Dad,
all right?
I...
...want...
...my...
...tip...
...Craig.
Hey, no problem...
...Dwight.
You're very strange, you know.
I still don't know
a thing about you.
Good night.
I have a couple questions I'd like to
ask you before I can say good night.
-Hi, I'm Richard.
-I'm Betty.
That was Napoleon. We're not home now,
but if you leave your name and number...
...we'll call you back
just as soon as we can.
Tommy? Napoleon won!
He's champion again.
Best dog in the show.
Can't wait to see you.
We'll celebrate when we're back.
Maybe I'll even let you
have one of those beers.
I think Napoleon wants to
talk to you. Here, boy!
