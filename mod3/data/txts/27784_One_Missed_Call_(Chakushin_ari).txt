Yes, Gladly.
Hai, Yorokonde!
I'm telling the truth!
No way!
It's true!
She's afraid of a peep-hole.
She can't peep through the hole.
Why?
Why? It beats me.
Yumi-chan.
Yumi-chan!
Do you have a "Peep-Hole Phobia"?
That's not it.
Natusmi is making up stories.
No, I'm not.
In the physical exam,
she could not take the "Eye Test".
Just because she feels...
theres something scary inside the hole.
Sounds like a trauma.
In man's memory
the most difficult one to forget is
"fear", they say.
Is that so...
There is a friend of mine...
who lives in an apartment
whose previous tenant committed suicide.
He once told me...
in the bathroom,
when he was washing his hair,
he felt something behind him.
bringing up goose bumps
When he tried to look back,
On his shoulder,
he saw a very abnormally thin...
woman's hand...
Yoko!
What happened to you?
A junior friend of mine from high school died.
Say...
April 16
9:44 PM
How did she die?
While scuba diving,
she got lost from her friends
and ended up drowning.
April 16 (Wed) 9:44 PM
Death by suffocation is
excruciating painful, they say.
When her body was recovered,
her face was twisted in pain.
Yoko, a phone call.
That's not my Ring Tone.
But it's your phone that's ringing.
From who?
No name. Just a phone number.
What?!
One Missed Call.
What is this?
What's up?
This is my cell phone number.
Huh?
Playing the "Recorded Message 1417"
9:45 PM.
There is one recorded message in your Inbox.
The latest messages... # 1
18th...
Evening...
11:04 PM
The message is...
Oh no!
Iyada!
It's started raining.
Oh, no!
Iyada!
It's started raining.
Isn't this voice...
There is no way that
you can get a call
from your own Cell phone.
Then, what is it?
Besides "18th" means
the day after tomorrow.
It's Yoko's voice, isn't it?
How on earth is it possible!
Do you know what you are saying?
Aah! It must be a prank call
from your boyfriend.
If I had a boyfriend,
I wouldn't come to a Singles party.
If you're really single and free,
why not go to Kawaguchiko Lake?
A friend of mine owns a hotel there.
Sounds great!
I'm on!
I'll organize everything.
Give me your Cell phone numbers.
Sure thing. OK...
Pass this to Yumi-chan.
Yumi-chan's number.
Sure.
Police Morgue
Rina's corpse
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Why are you so anti-social?
We have to keep her body at the Station.
The circumstances strongly
suggest homicide now.
Mr. Caretaker...
Your sister's name...
Was that Ritsuko-san, wasn't it?
Among the various indications
of the Child Abuse and Neglect,
There is a case we should discuss.
For example...
one child hits
other child's head for small matters,
Thus, showing wild and violent behavior.
Introductory Child Psychology
Nyumon Jido Shinri Gaku
a daily contact with such a child...
can see that one finds
a much more weaker figure as his target...
Shunsuke. Something came up.
I have to cancal our date.
You are damping Shunsuke now?
Yes. Kenji is cool, isn't he?
My type of guy...
To other children, small and or weak ones...
Hey you!
You in "Purple" dress!
Hey you!
What's the theme of this lecture?
"Abuse"...
creates "Abuse"...
...probably...
Mmm... that's correct.
For each of the case studies,
we'll discuss next week.
I have to be going now for my part time job.
See you!
She is so carefree now.
What's up?
Nothing...
Yes?
Yumi?
Yes.
Do you want to go shopping
with me tomorrow?
There's swim suit sale.
Kenji says he likes the beach.
I want to pick up a cute
one to impress him.
OK
Yoko, where are you right now?
What?
I can hardly hear you.
It's about time we found
a new part-time job.
What's going on?
Yumi?
Can you hear me?
Hello!
Yoko!
That voice message's time!
18th!
Isn't that 11:04 PM tonight?
Voice message?
Sorry, I can't hear anything.
What did you say?
Oh, no!
It's started raining.
Oh, no!
It's started raining.
Yoko...
April 18
11:04 PM
Yoko! What's up?!
Yoko!
Yoko!
What are you doing here?
Did you hear...
that Yoko...
didn't die instantly?
Her "right arm and leg" were chopped off.
But she was still conscious...
With her dying breath,
she reached for help.
No way...
I bet...
she was killed...
...Yoko Senpai...
What do you mean by "killed"?
Tell me what you know, please!
Yoko-senpai did receive a call
from her own Cell phone.
So?
Death-messaging call!
Death-messaging call?
Rina received the call.
Rina? Who is she?
Is she the one who died from diving?
After killing Rina.
From Rina's Cell phone,
it called Yoko Senpai's Cell phone.
What do you mean by "killed"?
You know who killed her?
I'm not so sure...
But I heard it's a woman
who had held grudges in this life.
Through Cell phones,
it finds the next victim.
And then...
It picks a new victim
from the Cell phone's memory.
and keeps on killing people,
as chain call of death.
You had better register
your Cell phone number
as "Never Accept Calls From This Number"
Let's go!
April 21
3:28 PM
Yoko died.
3 days ago...
in a train accident.
Does it have anything to do
with that prank call?
Yes.
Same day, same time.
Leaving the same message
as in the recorded one.
It's definitely fishy, isn't it?
But...
The cause of her death is suicide.
This isn't my voice, is it?
The 1st message is...
21st...
3:34 PM...
Shit!...
I totally forgot...
No way...
No way!
That sort of thing would never happen!
"21st" means today!
Only 2 minutes to the appointed hour.
There is no way!
You're trying to screw
with me, aren't you?!
Aah, it must be...
Mikamis asked you to do this. Right?
No, Kenji-kun, that's not it!
You made it all up, didn't you?
It's a sick joke!
I almost fell for it!
Hey! Kenji!
What?
Oh, yo!
Don't "Oh, yo!" me.
Aren't you the one who called us
to decide what to show
at a school's culture festival?
Shit!...
I totally forgot...
April 21
3:34 PM
Is this the right floor?
What's up?
Police Interrogation, alright...
but it is intended for general
reference purposes only.
Kawai Kenji-kun fell down
the elevator shaft by accident.
Even testified by his friend.
That was not it.
I've already told the other person.
Yoko and Kenji's Cell phones received...
Okazaki Yoko-san plunged to her death
from a railway bridge into a moving train.
There are witnesses who
claim to have seen her jump.
If that's not suicide,
what do you call it?
I don't know... but...
She must have been a drug user.
There is no way.
Everything in life has its
challenges and its reasons...
Any crime can be explained logically.
Beyond common sense, that one unthinkable,
unmistakable thing is happening right now.
Is that so?
Thank you for your cooperation.
So what they'd told us is true.
From Yoko's Cell phone
to Kenji's Cell phone...
It's true Yoko's Cell
stored Kenji's number.
In Kenji's Cell phone
our phone numbers were stored...
It's from a boyfriend from high school.
Hello?
Natsumi!
It's the same Ring
Tone... as Yoko's phone.
Not mine.
Yumi...
You've got a call. (1) Message
Why? I turned off the power.
April 23rd...
The day after tomorrow...
April 23rd (Wed) 10:39
PM Caller Konishi Natsumi
Noooo!
Hey you guys! What are you doing?
I don't trust these things, but you know...
I talked with Megumi.
Don't worry.
It's just a rumor...
Keep your chin up.
See you.
Yumi, you should delete your number.
You all want to delete
your numbers too, don't you?
I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure
this is supposed to work...
Delete mine, too.
Me, too!
Mine, too!
Hey!
Yumi!
This is the cancellation form.
Kindly fill in this form.
Yes.
Do you wish to keep your phone?
Dispose of it, please.
Yes, please.
I understand.
We'll reset the data inside.
There is nothing to
worry about your security.
Roll the film!
Which one is Konishi Natsumi-san?
Are you Konishi-san?
You are Konishi Natsumi-san
who has received a death-messaging call.
Please don't!
We have our resident Psychic Medium.
Do you want us to perform an Exorcism?
Exorcism?
I know you're pressed for time.
10:39 PM tomorrow will come shortly.
Natsumi, let's go. Get away, please.
Wait!
Can I see your Cell phone?
She already canceled the service.
Is that right?
Imai!
Yes!
Give me your Cell phone!
Your phone! Quick!
Hold this!
Hold this.
Shoot the Cell phone first.
Konishi-san!
Is this the Cell phone
that received a death-messaging call?
What are you saying?!
Natsumi!
Will you stop it already?!
What the hell is going on?
Stop everything.
Konishi-san...
This is really bad.
The death might really come to you.
You had better talk to the Psychic Medium.
Come with us.
We'll help you.
You know Tendo-sensei, don't you?
Famous for Exorcism.
I'm sure he will help you.
Let's go.
We'll go back to the studio.
Natsumi!
Let her go!
Yumi...
I'll go with them.
I don't want to be like "Yoko and Kenji. "
OK, let's go.
You go down the stairs and
shoot when we are coming out.
Yes.
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
Wait!
If you know something, tell me, please.
Otherwise, Natsumi is doomed to die!
When was it?
The appointed time?
Tomorrow... 10:39 PM.
Isn't it Yoko's...
Why do you have her...
The time she was hit by a train?
11:04 PM.
One minute later,
This is the number,
her Cell phone called.
Outgoing History April 18th
11:05 PM Called Number 0352293339
What does it mean?
Yoko called?
Not possible!
Her right hand that grabbed the Cell phone
was chopped off.
And it was found in a different place
where the rest of the body was found.
Then, who called?
Who the hell called the number?
April 22nd 3:23 PM
Called Number 0352293339
Oct 17th 4:32 PM
Called Number 0352293339
The same number.
Whose number is this?
You call the number now.
"The number you have dialed is not in use"
"Please check the number and dial again. "
Whose Cell phone is this?
It's my sister's.
6 months ago...
She got a call from her own Cell phone.
3 days later, she died in a fire.
Jawbreaker?
Yeah.
Why?
No idea.
When my sister was rescued,
she was still alive.
She was suffering from 10 degree burns.
But yet, she was still conscious.
The physician called it a miracle.
But I felt...
If she can't make it after all,
Why not give her a peaceful death?
Kagami Hospital
This is our old hospital's phone number
before we relocated here.
For emergency calls.
When did you move?
It was 5 months ago.
Wasn't she a patient of yours?
Her name is Okazaki Yoko.
After you called us,
I checked our records.
There was no record
of her admittance for treatment.
Kusaka-san, a call from Dr. Sato.
Yes.
Sorry, I must be going now.
Phone calls to this hospital...
What could it mean?
Tomorrow... 10:39 PM...
APRIL 23RD 10:39 PM Exclusive Coverage!
You might witness the shocking moment.
Emergency Live Show!
The college girl who received
the death-messaging call!
APRIL 23RD 10:39 PM
Special Emergency Broadcast!
A ring that connects all mysterious deaths.
Then, a new death-messaging call
reached her Cell phone.
What kind of fate is waiting for her?
APRIL 23RD 10:39 PM Life or Death?!
APRIL 23RD 10:39 PM
Will she come out alive?
Can this program save her from fate?
APRIL 23RD 10:39 PM
EXCLUSIVE LIVE COVERAGE!
I'll go to the studio to meet Natsumi.
That sound...
Here we go.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
That sound...
Just before Kenji fell down to the shaft,
I heard that sound in the elevator.
Asthma patient's body...
I thought you could answer my questions.
Jobs we received from the Kagami hospital
for the past year is...
Yellow color of the skin
Entire body is yellowish
Cirrhosis of the Liver
Yellow eyeballs...
He must have suffered a lot.
Look very carefully. His left leg is swollen.
Typical symptom of heart failure.
Far from the heart, organs started to die.
It is a slow death.
Body must suffer.
But don't worry.
You lose consciousness.
This is not it.
It might be a bit too harsh on you...
What?
What's going on?
What's this?
Mizunuma Mimiko 10 years old 2002/09/21
Declared dead at Kagami Hospital
7 months ago, she died of infantile asthma.
(M) Matsuda Yoshimi Matsumura Sensei Mizutani
Maki Mizunuma Marie Mitsui Kaoru Miyake Masako
Mizunuma Marie?
It's deceased Mimiko-chan's mother's name.
Let me use your phone.
Do you know the address of Mizunuma-san?
Yes, but...
Nobody lives there.
Fatherless Family and such...
After funeral,
this mother...
abruptly...
disappeared.
We haven't been paid for the funeral costs.
Hello?
Hello.
This is Mizunuma Residence.
We can't come to the phone right now.
After the beep, please leave your message.
Always the same recorded
message even on her cell phone.
I must tell you this.
If you die,
you'll be in this database.
Hello? Natsumi?
Hey, how have you been?
Natsumi!
Do you know Mizunuma-san?
Yeah!
What's the problem?
We go on air tomorrow.
Will you check this?
No. If you don't know, it's OK.
Natsumi, you shouldn't appear on TV.
I'm telling you that Tendo-Sensei's time
is being moved up 30 minutes.
Have him check the stage set.
He's so picky, you know.
Is this Psychic Medium really credible?
Come on! There is no way we can do that.
Can you take the responsibility?
Then, Yumi, you do something instead?
Natsumi...
Looks nice.
This wardrobe is a bit too bright.
I have to hung up.
Find a bit darker one.
Wait! Natsumi.
Natsumi!
Here.
My sister's appointment book.
She worked for the Children's Guidance Office.
July 18th...
Mizunuma Mimiko-chan... Asthma attack
July 21 Mizunuma Nanako-chan
swallowed thumb tacks.
That's Mimiko-chan's sister
Mimiko-chan... Asthma attack
July 26th... Mizunuma Nanako-chan
Light burn on her left thigh
July 30th... Mizunuma Nanako-chan
Pestiside went into her left eye.
Emergency treatments
at Kagami Hospital...
9 times!
in July only.
Hello?
I'll come to the office tomorrow.
Then,
I'll quit.
I was just fired.
Children's Guidance Office.
Mizunuma Marie had been
abusing her daughters.
Probably...
But we could not come to that
conclusion on the committee.
Why? They came to
hospital so often.
Certainly, Nanako-chan's sickness
and injuries were frequent.
She had never hidden anything.
On every occasion,
either Marie-san or
Mimiko-chan called for help.
Besides, doctors and
nurses told us...
Marie-san was making an
exceptional effort
to care for Nanako-chan.
Even without enough sleep.
Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy
How did you know?!
Ritsuko-san was suspecting
Munchausen syndrome By Proxy.
By Proxy what?
Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy
MSBP is a mental disorder
in which a person falsely reports
or causes symptoms
in another healthy person
under his or her care.
Why?
To satisfy one's craving
for attention and the limelight.
In a word,
a caregiver in this case,
a good mother,
receives attention,
sympathy...
and appraisal.
For such a stupid purpose?
Physically harm her own child
to produce symptoms?
It's often related to the abuser's
childhood experience.
In fact,
when Mimiko-chan
went into convulsion.
there is a rumor
that Marie-san was beside her.
But she ignored her.
Poor Mimiko-chan...
She was a kind child,
who took good care of her sister.
This is very bad.
What?
Her face was not this
visible last time, was it?
Police do not and will not...
work on a murder
that has not been committed.
Natsumi might be killed today!
Is that so?
Didn't I tell you?
It's useless.
What?!
If Police had investigated
my sister's death
6 months ago properly,
there wouldn't be this many victims.
Victims? Who are you referring to?
Okazaki Yuko, Kawai Kenji -
I found the same jawbreakers
from their mouth.
They're all fucking victims!
Pretending to be a detective is fun?
Don’t get carried away.
Would you care for some candy?
I'll go to the TV station alone.
Cancel your cell phone now.
And don't get involved.
But Natsumi is in trouble!
If you don't want to be alone,
go back to your family.
My family house...
I haven't been there since
high school graduation.
I'm coming, too.
Hey!
Excuse me... Pardon me...
We'll hold a conference later.
Don't worry. Keep your chin up.
Tama-chan! Are you ready?
Yes!
I'll attach a mic here.
Natsumi!
Off limits to outsiders
Call the guards! Remove them!
Let's go!
Yumi! TV doesn't do anything good.
One minute to on-air!
Hurry up!
Excuse me! Pardon me! Make way, please!
Natsumi! Natsumi!
One minute to on-air!
We'll go to Cam #4!
One minute to on-air!
Cam #2 stand by!
Natsumi-san goes into the center stage.
Stand by. Wait for my Cue!
You stand by right here, OK.
First we count 5 and then live on air at 2.
Hey, hey, your in the way!
30 Seconds to on-air!
30 Seconds to on-air!
Great place... I discovered lately...
Cheap and Yummy.
Hello? Kaori-chan?
I can't talk to you now.
Hey! MC! Answer to me!
Attention! 10 seconds to on-air!
5 seconds, counting!
Finally the time has come.
What will you do
if you got warnings of impending death
by your own voice
through your own Cell phone?
Tonight we get together a team
to investigate this death-messaging call,
that shook our entire country.
We go on live with this
Emergency Broadcast
and you see with your own eyes
what this is all about.
One co-ed received this
death-messaging call.
The appointed time is tonight,
on this day, April 23rd.
at 10:39 PM.
It is exactly 38 minutes from now.
We brought together Experts
in Paranormal Phenomena.
Hirayama Masakazu-san,
Isobe Akira-san
Furuki Emika-san
Give us your hands, please.
Just started!
Aren't you watching?
Let me know when the Ghost shows up.
First let's go to the video tape
to recreate what had happened.
You don't fit...
as a detective.
Let's welcome Konishi Natsumi-san
who had received this dreadful message.
Please come over here.
Follow her move!
Please come over here.
Can you talk?
Please be seated.
I'll ask you a lot of questions that you may
or may not be able to immediately answer.
First Konishi-san, I'll
ask you straight out.
I heard that you had lost 2 friends lately.
Is it true?
Yes.
I see... it is true.
One thing in common between the two is
each Cell phone shows the
incoming call from his
or her own Cell phone.
Recorded Message has a date
and time stamped in the future.
On the appointed day and time.
On the appointed day and time, they died.
What a beautiful profile!
If it's a prank, it'd be a lot of work.
And this time, Konishi-san's Cell phone
received this video image
instead of her own voice messages.
The Death Warning Count-down
timer processing 25:00
Run the Video.
I had gone drinking with her several times
I must say that I got surprised
Rather shocking I should say...
...within a short period of time,
two students from the same school died.
The Death Warning Count-down
timer processing 19:53
Possibly a distorted
human relationships...
From psychological point,
you might want to say so, but
This is "Paranormal Phenomena. "
You always talk that way.
Less than 15 minutes to the appointed time.
15 seconds to commercial.
What is going to happen to her?
After commercial, we'll welcome
Tendo-sensei, our resident Psychic Medium.
Music, Enter!
Will she come out alive
from the studio?
Now we go into commercials.
Good!
So far, so good!
Not good. Not working well.
No, you're doing OK.
The stage is yours, Tendo Hakusui-Sensei.
We need your help more than ever.

this incident.
5 years ago, at the end of the year,
I was suffering a high fever.
At that time, Konishi-san,
I had already met you.
Under the sunshade parasol
you were crying.
In the purity and clarity of Heaven...
In the purity and clarity of this world...
I am...
alone...
In the purity and clarity of...
Did you fix this, Kudo-chan?
No, I didn't do anything.
No! Stop there!
No!
Out of my way!
Hey!
I must get in!
Let me in!

The first message is...

7:13 PM.
Why?
Why?
Nakamura Yumi's Apartment
You'd better take a rest.
Call your friend.
Have him stay with you.
Until then, I'll be with you.
How about a drink?
Can I open beer or something?
Tomorrow...
It's useless.
It's unavoidable, it just happens.
Tomorrow night...
Just like Natsumi...
Don't give up.
16 hours to go...
What do you think I can do?
What's that scar?
Were you by any chance...
Abused by your parents?
By my mother...
How about your father?
He didn't stop your mother?
He was never at home...
My Grandma had always
tried to save me.
Yumi?
Call Granny here.
Yes!
Granny!
I'm sorry.
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!
Hey!
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
Hey!
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.
Mizunuma Marie's Apartment
She had just disappeared
leaving everything behind.
I'm in trouble.
Return the key on your way back.
Here you are.
You don't have to take your shoes off.
I have to clean everything anyway.
Mizunuma Marie Mimiko Nanako
This!
As of November 23rd, 14th
year of Heisei, (2002)
we terminate your Cell
phone service contract
due to non-payments.
Then, how come we connected
to the Message Service Center?
Where is the phone connected to?
What's up?!
You should go home and take a rest.
I'll take care of the rest.
Musashino Orphanage
Yes, that's her.
Nanako-chan...
Nanako-chan, do you know
where your mother is?
Nanako-chan
Sorry, but...
She can't talk.
Not from birth...
But from abuse, most likely...
Nanako-chan...
Your bear is sick again?
Any word from her mother?
During these 6 months...
None at all.
That song...
This?
Some time ago,
It became popular from
a Children's TV program.
Where's your Mom?
You don't really know?!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Do you happen to know
where Mizunuma-san is?
Well...
At that time, unless she working
she practically lived
in the hospital.
She was more knowledgeable
about the hospital
than the newly recruited nurses.
Well then...
What is being built on old hospital site?
Nothing.
It hasn't been torn down
yet, I should say.
Yamashita-san, it's me.
I told you to go home.
I couldn't sit still.
Old Kagami Hospital is
still standing there.
I'll pay a visit now.
W- Wait! Wait... I'll go.
What's the address?
I got it.
You stay in the room.
But!
T...
Time is pressed.
But I will come see you.
Do you understand?
Then, see you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

...Calling... Nakamura Yumi
Mizunuma Marie's Cell phone?
Come on!
Stop this fucking call!
April 24
7:13 PM
It's over.
Everything is alright now.
It's probably...
Mizunuma Marie's corpse.
You'd better not look.
She wanted to be
found by someone...
Yumi!
Yumi!
Yumi!
Yumi!
Brother!
Ritsuko...
Brother...
There are various skies
to every one.
Mother...
I won't run away from you.
I'll be a good girl...
I'll stay with you forever.
I'll stay with you, Mother... forever here.
I'll do anything you say.
More than 6 months have
passed since she died.
And one more thing.
This phone's call history contains
Okazaki Yoko, Konishi Natsumi
and all other victims'
phone numbers.
I contacted Mizunuma Nanako's orphanage.
The Orphanage Director has
something you should take a look at.
Me?
Will you come to the
orphanage with us?
Don't worry.
We'll take good care
of Nakamura-san.
Shall we?...
Musashino Orphanage
Hope Room
This...
I found it in Nanako-chan's bag.
What is it?
This is Mizunuma Marie's room.
To the hospital...
I'll take you there.
Sorry, I'm late...
I was right...
Mimiko, you've been doing this.
The one who has been hurting you...
...was't your Mother...
...but your sister...
Tell me...
But my sister always
popped a jawbreaker into my mouth.
"I hope you get better soon", she said.
Mom!...
I can't breathe.
Mom!...
I can't breathe.
The one who'd killed "Ritsuko and Natsumi"
is not "Marie!"
It's Mimiko!
W... What do you mean?!
Marie was probably the first victim.
The deceased Mimiko accessed
Marie's Cell phone.
W... Wait a minute!
Then,...
I've been trying to call...
but I can't connect to Yumi.
Send someone immediately!
Yumi!
Yumi!
Yamashita-san?
It's me!
Yumi, are you alright?
Yumi, are you alright?
Yumi, are you alright?
Yumi, are you alright?
Yamashita-san?
Yumi, are you alright?
Yumi, are you alright?
April 24
7:13 PM
Why?
Why?
Yumi!
Yumi...
What is the matter?
Where is Mimiko?
You are alright.
You're really alright?!
I'm so relieved...
To the hospital...
I'll take you there.
