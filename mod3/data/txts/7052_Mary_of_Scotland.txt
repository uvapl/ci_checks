The most high and mighty sovereign,
Elizabeth,
by the grace of God, Queen of England.
Burghley! Randolph!
Look alive, milords.
Are you glued to the floor?
Get out! Get out!
- Has something upset Your Majesty?
- Throckmorton, tell them!
Milords, Mary Stuart
has sailed from France for Scotland.
What are we to do?
Did Your Majesty grant her
England's safe conduct at sea?
No!
She defied my ambassador,
defied me,
refused to acknowledge
I am the rightful Queen of England.
- 'Tis true, milords.
- Now she shows her true colours.
Suppose she lands.
What then?
Her presence in Scotland will endanger
Your Majesty's throne, naturally.
But she is the legitimate heir of Henry VII,
and her claims to succeed Your Majesty
must be acknowledged.
Not by me. Never.
I should fail in my duty to Your Majesty
if I did not state facts.
We must face the fact that,
in the eyes of Europe,
you are a pretender
to the throne of England,
because the marriage of your father,
Henry VIII,
to your mother, Anne Boleyn,
is deemed invalid.
They call me illegitimate. Go on.
That being faced, Mary Stuart
must not be allowed to land in Scotland.
She will use that throne
as a stepping stone to yours.
She must be seized at sea.
By English ships, Your Majesty? But that
would offend France, offend all Europe.
Have I no captain
who can raise a black flag on occasion?
They do it often enough when I forbid it.
- What happened, Randolph?
- Hawkins! Drake!
What did she say?
O Heavenly Father,
I give thee thanks
for the security of this voyage
which has brought us safely
to my native land.
Counsel my heart.
Guide my steps in this land of my birth,
that I may rule with piety and wisdom.
The queen is coming!
Queen Mary is coming!
The queen is coming!
The queen is coming!
I have had enough!
- Milord.
- Yes?
Your sister Mary, Queen of Scots,
she's on her way to Edinburgh.
- You're daft, man.
- But I've seen her, milord.
She landed at Leith.
She'll be here most any moment.
Your regency's over, Moray.
You'll step down now.
Aye, no longer you'll rule Scotland.
Milords...
we'd better go down and meet her.
No. You'll wait here.
You've gathered here to welcome her.
Understand?
And another thing, remember you lords
are the real power of Scotland.
You can afford to hold your tongues.
I warn you, leave all speech to Lethington.
Especially you, Ruthven and Morton.
Your Majesty.
James.
James Stuart.
Ha! I would've known you anywhere.
And I, you, my dear sister.
Welcome home.
Welcome to Scotland, Mary.
Thank you, James.
Frankly, I was worried.
Thank heaven you crossed the sea safely.
Oh, none too safely, James.
We were pursued, nearly taken.
They did capture the ship
carrying our horses.
That's why I came
on that ridiculous horse.
A fine way to travel
for a triumphant homecoming.
Pursued at sea? By freebooters?
<i>Ha! A freebooter,
with a skirt, I daresay.</i>
The lords of Scotland are waiting
to greet you. They're in the Great Hall.
Will you... will you see them now?
Oh, I'm a sight, and I did so want to
look my best after all these years.
Remember the old days
at Inchmahome, James?
I was a spoiled little girl,
and you seemed such a man.
You'll never know how I admired
and looked up to you in those days.
You haven't changed at all, James.
I wish to thank you for the welcome
you have given me, milords.
I have been 13 years away.
It was not of my own choice
that I went away,
but it is of my own choice
that I have returned.
You will find me young,
perhaps inexperienced,
but with the support of all of you
and with the Earl of Moray at my side,
I shall rule fairly and justly.
We thank Your Gracious Majesty.
The name of Stuart, of your father,
is loved and honoured in Scotland.
One moment, Lethington.
Can't we welcome Her Majesty
without the presence of foreigners?
No, David.
Rizzio is my secretary.
He will remain.
- Continue, Lethington.
- No affront is intended, Your Majesty.
I understand.
On behalf of these lords and nobles
of your kingdom,
I wish to assure you
of our unwavering loyalty.
Differences we may have, aye,
but they shall not divide us.
Differences?
What differences?
Oh, nothing that cannot be resolved,
Your Majesty.
What differences, milords?
Lethington meant nothing
of any importance, my dear sister.
Exactly what did he mean, James?
He was mindful of your... religion.
You call that nothing of importance?
It's your religion too, James.
Please try to understand. Conditions
are changing. The old faith is passing.
This is John Knox's day in Scotland.
- And you've gone over to his side?
- I've only followed my conscience.
I hope you have one, James.
I had your own interest at stake.
I was regent.
It was my duty to protect your throne.
By attacking what I hold most dear?
By making friends with Knox. Do you
realise the power he holds over people?
If you want the people behind you,
do as Moray's done.
Aye, there's Elizabeth.
<i>Where is Elizabeth?</i>
Born in the old faith like yourself, milady.
But she gets off a ship when it sinks.
I don't like your tone, Ruthven.
My religion is no garment
to be put on and off with the weather.
You had better know that, all of you!
I shall worship as I please,
<i>and hope for all men
to worship as they please in Scotland.</i>
Good for you, lassie!
You're from the north, Huntly.
Are you a turncoat?
No, no. And I'll defend to the death
your right to worship as you wish.
Thank you, Huntly.
And now let that be an end
of this unimportant matter.
Is there anything else
on your minds, milords?
- We're here to speak of your marriage.
- Ruthven!
- Go on, Lethington!
We have hesitated to mention this,
Your Majesty, but now you have returned.
Why mince words, Lethington?
The King of France died when I was 18.
Naturally, I'm free to marry again,
if I choose to.
We realise the matter is... delicate,
Your Majesty.
I'm glad you realise that.
But the matter is of the gravest
importance. These are troubled times.
If you made a foreign alliance,
what would happen here?
Until you are safely married
to a loyal Scot whom we can trust,
Scotland will be unsettled.
All we wish is to see you safe
on your throne.
It's quite true, dear sister.
Until men know what alliance you will
make, the clans sleep swords in hands.
I suppose you've decided
on my husband?
- Aye.
- One of you?
- We wouldn't stand for that!
We've considered
only your welfare in choosing.
- Choosing whom?
- Lord Darnley.
He is a Stuart, next heir after yourself
to the throne of England.
You yourself said you would never
give up your claim to the succession.
Marry Darnley and strengthen it.
Of course, I can't give myself out
to be a virgin queen
like our cousin, Elizabeth.
But suppose I don't choose
to marry at all.
Then you'll do as you please,
and I'm behind you, lassie.
Thank you, Huntly.
I see I have one friend here.
Where is the Earl of Bothwell?
Is he here?
- Why do you laugh, Morton?
- No offence to Your Majesty.
- It concerns the Earl of Bothwell?
- Something he said about Your Majesty.
And what did he say?
Bothwell said
you and Elizabeth rolled together
wouldn't make an honest woman.
And do my lords allow
my name to be slandered?
Your Majesty, you're mistaken. There's
no love lost between us and Bothwell.
- Take no account of such speech.
- I shall take account of it.
I shall take account of all the veiled insults
flung at me under the guise of welcome.
Lassie...
I realise now what kind of support
I may expect from all of you,
even from my own half-brother.
- My dear sister...
- I know where you and I stand now.
Go ahead, form your council.
Do as you wish. I'll have no hand in it.
Up until now, I have never done anything
of my own wish.
The ambition of other men carried me
to France when I was a child.
The ambition of other men married me to
a dying boy who became King of France.
I wasn't asked. But I'm through.
<i>I'm going to live my own life,
do as I say.</i>
I refuse to marry.
I love no one and I shall marry no one.
I'm going to begin to be myself -
Mary Stuart!
Oh!
She sits on the throne
only so long as we maintain her!
- Softly, softly.
- Why? Do you curry favour with her?!
She'll find out
we'll stand for only so much!
She'll sit on the throne
only as long as we keep her there!
Slander! She is our queen
and she'll remain our queen.
- I'll back you in that.
- I'll go with you.
Softly, softly. There'll be no throne,
no Scotland, if we fall out.
- Who's going to keep her in hand?
- I will. She'll accept the council I propose.
Have you already picked yourself
as prime minister, Moray?
Aye. And with Lethington
secretary of state, what have you to fear?
I'll serve her faithfully,
Moray, I promise.
As long as it serves your own purposes.
But who's to look after the rest of us?
I will. I promise you.
<i>Madonna.</i>
We hail from the burn side
The hills and the glens
When the pipes o' the queen
sound the call
And glad are the hearts
O' her loyal highland men
Whether victory or death
May befall
Tho' the road be long and drear
When the pibroch's ringing clear
With the skirl of Stuarts
Off to war
We will fight for our queen
She's the fairest ever seen
So the Scots may be free as of yore
For chains shall not bind us
No English yokes shall fall
Let us free Scotland for evermore
And a while ago I...
I wanted to run away.
It all seemed so hateful.
But now...
I'll find a way to win.
Tho' the road be long and drear
When the pibroch's ringing clear
With the skirl of Stuarts
Off to war
Scotia, land fresh and fair
Pine and heather fill the air
Bonnie land
That our forefathers bore
Our queen we'll defend
Stuart's cause will never end
Till we free Scotland
For evermore
We will fight for our queen
She's the fairest ever seen
So the Scots may be free as of yore
For chains shall not bind us
No English yokes shall fall...
Aye! Singing! Dancing! Drinking!
And all the vile and evil uses of the flesh!
They run before this Jezebel of France
like a foul air!
Aye, she's a Stuart on her father's side.
But who was her mother?
Who was her mother?!
French Mary of Guise!
She who was regent when George
Wishart was burned alive for heresy!
And what was his heresy?
Preaching the Reformed religion.
Teaching me, John Knox,
the wisdom and the glory of God.
Aye, and the flames
that consumed my teacher
bit deep into this heart.
Did Mary Stuart come to Scotia whilst
she sat on the golden throne of France?
No! No!
She was lost in luxury
and the sinful joys of the flesh.
And now - now, when fate has cast her
down from that throne of sin -
she remembers
another gem in her crown,
the gem she was born with -
Scotland!
The time has come for all men
to choose between the kilt of Scotland
and this Jezebel of France!
Master Knox.
Aye. We Scots know
who fought for the mother.
Aye. And we Scots remember
who fought against her.
Mock me if you will,
you can never silence my tongue.
I'm no such fool, Master Knox.
You can't silence 10,000 trumpets.
But I can match you with a better tune,
and from a better bag of wind.
I shall say what I have come to say,
and neither rank nor station
shall avail mine enemies!
- Follow, my people!
Have we not had enough
of the Guises and their followers?!
Aye! Let them stick
to their warmer climates!
And may they come to a hundred plagues
before ever they could have
another standard here!
Go! Back! Back, I say!
Stop! Stop, I say!
Stop! Or I shall bring down
the curse of God upon you!
Aye!
Stop! Or I shall bring down
the curse of God upon you!
Aye!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Your Majesty,
may I rid your presence of this old goat?
I wish to speak to this gentleman.
Won't you come inside,
Master Knox?
Is there anything to fear?
Look at me, Master Knox. Can you believe
in your heart I'm as wicked as you say?
Do you not bring back the old faith that
we have cast out as the work of Satan?
Is it a crime to be steadfast
in the faith of our fathers?
There is only one true faith,
and that I preach.
Preach your faith, Master Knox, preach it.
Let me practise mine.
- Can I forget whose daughter..?
- True, I am the daughter of Mary of Guise.
It is true I keep my mother's religion.
Still, I'll respect your own and give you as
much freedom as I'll demand for myself.
- Aye, they told me you spoke fairly.
- Can't you also? Can't you be tolerant?
I want to be loved by my people.
I need their support.
- Your support, your friendship.
- You heard my words in the courtyard.
I heard words that another sovereign
would call treason,
words that another sovereign
would punish as my mother did.
I called you Jezebel of France out there,
and I'll call it you again.
I believe in your sincerity,
Master Knox.
I only ask you to believe in mine.
- Can't we be friends?
- I have said what I came to say.
But you no longer mean it. You...
Well, blast his insolence!
The old ram. He ought to be hung.
- It'll take more than love to rule this land.
- I haven't asked your opinion!
Good.
Good. You've got a temper.
Well, don't curb it, Your Majesty. Make
force your crown and fear your sceptre.
- Are you captain of the guards?
- No. I just arrived.
Then leave and don't return
until you learn to hold your tongue.
I'm afraid that will be never,
Your Majesty.
I see I've arrived too late.
Moray has already told you about me.
About you? You pride yourself.
Aye.
It's a way I have, Mary Stuart.
Erm... who are you?
You heard my pipers.
You don't remember my clan?
Which clan?
When you hear those pipes,
you know the Bothwells are about.
- So you are the Earl of Bothwell.
- At Your Majesty's service.
And did you say that
Elizabeth Tudor and I rolled together
wouldn't make an honest woman?
Oh, no. Not at all.
<i>What I really said was the two of you
together wouldn't make a properwoman.</i>
But that was years ago when I saw you
in France -just a skinny little girl.
I wouldn't say it now.
You're a very outspoken man,
Milord Bothwell.
That's one privilege I've always retained.
Oh, come now, you don't want flattery.
I've confessed. Forgive me.
Well, you did fight in defence
of my mother. I thank you for that.
Don't thank me. It was a pleasure.
I have found many enemies here.
Have I also found a friend?
You'll only find out who's your friend
in Scotland by putting him to the test.
Tonight I need loyal backing
more than my mother did.
So I imagined. Hearing Moray and
the lords were here to... welcome you,
I rode over from the border.
- You stand with them against me?
Where are they?
They are forming my council in the hall.
- Bothwell! Where have you been?
- Down to the border, Morton,
hanging a few of your clansmen.
Well, milords,
have you divided the spoils?
We're forming Her Majesty's council.
- You, Moray, as prime minister, I fancy.
- Naturally.
- You, Morton, as secretary of state.
- Och!
- Or is it Ruthven?
- No, Lethington.
- Aye, Lethington.
- Oh, indeed?
- Who's to be the lieutenant general?
- That's for me.
Well, you're all wrong, gentlemen.
I've decided to take charge
of Her Majesty's armed forces myself.
- We'll not allow it, Bothwell!
- You're too late.
I've just accepted the appointment.
- From whom?
- From Her Majesty, the Queen.
Didn't you say Milord Randolph was
expected to return from Scotland today?
I did, Your Majesty.
I wonder what's keeping him.
Some pretty face, I dare say.
Are you growing jealous of Randolph,
Leicester?
Is it any fault of mine,
Your Majesty?
More and more, you're giving your
important commissions to Randolph.
- There was a time when I basked in...
- Don't say "bask".
It reminds me of a fish.
Your Majesty,
you know my feelings.
You must realise how they're torn
when... when you avert your gaze.
Your Majesty,
I beg you on my knees.
Milord Randolph,
ambassador to Scotland.
Get up!
Did you convey my friendly greetings
to Mary Stuart?
Tell her how I rejoice
at her safe return from France?
Most ardently, Your Majesty.
"Ardently"?
I begin to understand your dallying.
I've heard of her enchantment.
Tell me,
is she as pretty as they say?
You may see for yourself.
She sent you this token of her love.
A girl,
not a queen.
Tell me, what's she like?
Most charming, Your Majesty.
Already she has many suitors.
Chief among them is Lord Darnley.
Darnley?
Another thorn in my crown.
A weakling, a drunkard.
But he stands next to my throne,
after her.
I'd be in double jeopardy
if she married him.
In my opinion, Your Majesty,
the Earl of Bothwell removes that danger.
He's restored more order in a month
in the north than it's known for ten years.
He's a mainstay.
And it's plain he's in love with her.
Do you think I could sleep
with Bothwell on the throne beside her?
But, Your Majesty,
she's a creature of love.
Believe me, your fears are unfounded.
She wins men to her side in gentle ways.
Aye?
I see she has won our Randolph, among
others. You shall go north no more!
- Your Majesty!
- Throckmorton, you're a cold fish.
You shall be my ambassador to Scotland.
- But, Your Majesty, I'm simply giving...
- Leave us! Leave us!
And take care...
or your heart will fall off your sleeve.
Darnley... Bothwell.
Am I never to have peace?
- She must be defeated.
- How?
Declare war.
Unite Scotland with England.
War...
Is that all you men know?
<i>Unite Scotland against England,
you mean.</i>
Unite Scotland under Mary Stuart.
But how else is she to be defeated?
Do you know what it is
to be born illegitimate?
To have royal blood in your veins,
and that one word
standing between you and the throne?
How it makes ambition burn?
Who was it ruled Scotland
before she returned?
- Who wants to rule again?
- The Earl of Moray.
You shall ride north tonight
as my ambassador, Throckmorton,
and get in touch with Moray.
So... Lord Bothwell has put down
the rebellion on the border.
- Has he returned yet?
- Not yet, madame.
Why that tone?
- I no longer have your confidence.
- That's not true.
You know you must secure your throne
by marrying, yet every time I mention it...
- You don't like Bothwell.
- He is a good lieutenant.
- But his religion rules him out?
- He has none! All he believes in is this!
I should be thankful. It's done more for me
than your music and talk about marriage.
- I'm sorry, David.
- I try only to serve you faithfully.
Yes. You're as fanatical in your way
as John Knox is in his.
I often wonder which you love the most -
myself or my religion.
I would never betray either.
You imply that I would?
You are the sole defender of our faith
on these islands.
What becomes of that
if you marry a heretic?
Meaning Bothwell?
Even Lord Darnley
is one hundred times a better choice.
At least he's of the faith.
- Why must I marry at all?
- To have an heir.
To be true to your blood. To escape the
tyranny of lords who laugh in your face.
You're a worst tyrant in your loyalty
than they are in their disloyalty, David.
I have never urged Your Majesty
to marry a Scot.
Marry in Europe where your destiny is.
My destiny is here, in Scotland.
Whom would you have me marry?
Tell me.
Look at these marriage proposals.
First and foremost, Don Carlos of Spain.
Onions?
The Archduke of Austria is not so good
a match, but he's eager.
- No, no. Beer, not women.
- The King of Sweden.
- But his ears...
- Don't forget the King of Denmark.
Forget him? Impossible.
Would Scotland ever be quiet?
- I assure you he's a very peaceable man.
- But they say he snores.
The Duke of Anjou, the Prince de Condé,
the Duke of Ferrara, the Duc d'Orléans.
<i>Sua Maestà, non si prenda gioco di me!</i>
<i>Lo l'amo! Lo sono alle... sue!</i>
<i>Giorno e notte,
io sono per il suo bene!</i>
Ah, no. David, David...
David. Oh...
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make fun of you.
Oh... I know you're right.
I can't put it off any longer.
- But I vow I'll not marry in Europe.
- Marry Lord Darnley, then.
There is no one else.
Marry him, madame, I beg you.
Very well, David.
You're not serious?
Oh, yes, I am.
Now it's over.
Finished.
I knew it had to be, really.
Go, summon Darnley.
I'll tell him at once.
No... No, David.
Lord Darnley.
Ah, the four pretty wenches.
Five, milord,
now that you're here.
Oh, I say.
You call me pretty?
Well, as I always say, my dears,
the fairest flower in Scotland
grows on the highest bough.
My lord!
I've been waiting all day.
Am I never to see Her Majesty?
You'll see her
when she wants to see you, milord.
Ah, the four protective angels.
Oh, hello, Darnley.
Still hanging around, eh?
- Where's Her Majesty?
- In her study with the ambassador.
And strict orders not to be disturbed.
Don't shake your finger at me,
snub-nose.
Or I'll spank you where you belong.
I'm left out in the cold too, Bothwell.
And these lassies
have no time for plain Scotsmen.
- How long am I to be kept waiting?
- Listen. You'd think he owned the place.
If I did, there'd be no Lord Throckmorton
around, I can tell you that.
Oh, I forgot, Darnley,
he's a friend of yours.
I hear he's promised
to back your claim to England
if you take yourself out of Scotland.
Jealous, Bothwell?
On the contrary,
I think it's a first-rate idea.
I shall wait for Her Majesty below.
<i>- Don't go on my account.
- I'm not going on your account, sir.</i>
I suppose you laugh at me too
behind my back.
Oh, no!
It's not safe to laugh at a barbarian!
For two farthings,
I'd put you over my knee.
- Oh, milord.
- Tell Her Majesty I want to see her!
What can you do with a man like that?
He won't take no for an answer.
<i>Some day you'll meet a man
who won't take no for an answer.</i>
- And?
- And I'll be the godfather.
- Now will you tell the queen?!
- No, I won't!
Then here I stay.
For one hour, Lord Throckmorton,
you've been talking in circles.
I still don't know what Elizabeth wants.
- Do I fail to speak fluently?
- You conceal your purpose.
Your Majesty.
You tell me again and again of Elizabeth's
friendship. I, too, give her my friendship.
We're two rulers in two adjoining
countries. We're related by blood ties.
There's every reason for friendship
based on understanding.
But how can there be understanding
without frankness?
- Be frank. What is it Elizabeth wants?
- Very well.
Marry the man she chooses and she will
recognise you as the next heir in England.
My succession was ordained
by circumstances out of her control.
I don't need her acknowledgement.
My mistress only meant that
if you married a man of her choosing,
it would show no threat to her throne.
She has someone in mind,
I suppose?
She... she did mention a name,
Your Majesty.
- Who?
- The Earl of Leicester.
She named him?
She had the temerity
to name the Earl of Leicester?
No one stands higher
in her esteem than Leicester.
Why, she's shown that.
She's flaunted him before all England.
Her favourite, her leavings.
Now she wants to cast him off on me?
Make me a laughing stock
before the world?
- Please, Your Majesty.
- Let me tell you the rest.
My cousin Elizabeth has never taken
a single step that wasn't political.
She's afraid I will marry the one man
who embodies everything she fears,
the man who is next heir after me
to her throne - Lord Darnley.
That is sheer imagination.
It is not in my nature to play politics,
but now I shall.
There is no other course I can follow
and keep faith with my faith,
and with the name I bear.
Now I know what I shall do.
You Majesty,
I beg of you not to be rash.
Leave me.
Go back to Elizabeth.
Tell her what I have said.
David,
go and find Lord Darnley.
Have you seen Lord Darnley?
- Why?
- Her Majesty wishes to see him, privately.
A room's a room and a door's a door.
I've been waiting for hours!
Are you a man
or a storm not to be brought in?
- When my girl won't see me, I'm a storm.
- Is that how you speak of me?
You expect me to bow and make pretty
speeches? I'm a soldier. And I love you.
- You take everything by storm.
- Know a better way?
- You forget I'm your queen.
- Have I ever forgotten that?
But I remember you're a woman.
- I won't be talked to that way.
- You will. You're going to listen.
You know I love you. You've known it
from the first moment I met you.
I command you to leave me.
What's come over you, Mary?
You're frightened.
- You say you're a queen. Be one.
- What else am I trying to do? Leave me.
- While you go and marry someone else?
- Yes.
- Now, I'm in no mood for jokes.
- I'm going to marry Lord Darnley.
- You're what?
- Marry Lord Darnley.
- You're out of your mind.
- Let me go.
- No, you can't.
- Let me go.
- I'll never let you go. I love you!
- You have no right.
I have a right.
Don't pretend you don't care.
I know days when you told me you did,
with your eyes, with everything you did.
- No.
- You can't lie to me.
I've made up my mind.
I'm marrying Darnley.
Darnley.
Why didn't you pick a man?
Tell me that you love him, Mary,
and I'll let you go.
Aye, you can't do it.
I can.
I... do.
Will you learn
this isn't your kingdom, but mine?
- Yours for how long?
- You think I can't rule without you?
- Try it.
- You can't leave Scotland!
- You've seen the last of me, Mary.
- I won't give you leave.
I don't need your leave, nor leave-taking.
I'm just going!
Lord Darnley, Your Majesty.
Lord Darnley...
You have asked my hand in marriage.
- I have decided to grant it.
- Your Majesty!
Why, I have hardly hoped.
I haven't dared.
Oh, I'll love you,
keep you, defend you.
We shall face troubled times.
This is some dream!
A jest! It can't be true!
And yet...
it is true.
I never dreamed
I am to hold you in my arms.
They say a kiss seals the bargain.
James,
they're waiting for you to say it.
Sister, we're troubled by your apparent
lack of confidence in this council.
"Apparent."
Why not say "obvious"
and be frank?
It's our rightful duty to shape your policies
and for you to accept them.
Instead of which, you constantly
take the advice of your secretary, Rizzio.
Oh, I begin to see.
- You want me to get rid of David.
- Aye. Send him back where he belongs.
- Well, I shan't.
- You'd better think twice about that.
- Are you giving me orders?
- No, no.
- Ruthven only meant to say...
- I know what Ruthven means to say.
He means to say that I'm a fool. Though
he never dares put it quite that boldly.
<i>Well, I have been a fool.</i>
I lost Bothwell,
who held you all in check.
I thought I was ruling Scotland,
but it was only his strength behind me.
But I still have David.
You can't take Scotland for yourselves
so long as he is by my side.
- I shall never let him go.
- He may be sorry if you don't.
Some day
you may be sorry for that tongue.
In spite of my mistakes,
I've won my people to me.
You all know it and fear it.
Sit down, milords.
Sit down. It's only your king.
Always holding council,
eh, Moray?
Always talking, talking.
- You're late.
- Oh, I don't take orders any more.
I'm king now.
Even if someone doesn't seem to know it.
You never can count on a woman.
Marry one and she turns to ice.
Agh!
They're all alike,
even the queen!
Can't stand the sight of you.
Saying you're drunk
when you need a kiss or two.
Would you believe it, Moray?
They lock doors at night.
And all the while
they're thinking of someone else.
Some fellow
who's gone to France, perhaps!
Mary!
Where's the queen?
Open that door. Open that door!
Well, Moray?
- Will Your Majesty sign these papers?
- Where's my wife?
- Alone with her ladies, sire.
- But you have access to her, eh, Rizzio?
Will you sign these papers now,
Your Majesty?
Later. Later!
- Now you know.
- If I thought...
- lf, if, if!
- Open your eyes, man.
- Who else is with her all the time?
- Day and night, alone.
Regain her favour.
Be king in fact as well as name.
- Show her you don't lack courage.
- Who said I lack courage?!
How dare you address me?!
Eight of the clock and all's well!
The queen's guards!
All's well!
My life is in the north
And my heart is in the south
False I've pledged with my hand
False I've kissed with my mouth
With hand caught to hand
And the rain driving blind
As the new years have driven
Old love out of mind
As the new years have driven
Old love out of mind
What is that song, David?
It's a song I... I made up.
Oh, he's always making up
some nonsense about love.
Aren't you in love, Beaton?
Just a soldier.
Not a penny to his name.
Why don't you marry him?
- And live on air?
- On anything.
What do you see in the fire, David?
The sunshine of Italy?
You want to go home, don't you?
You're my only friend
and they're driving you away.
I want you to go, David,
for your own sake.
Though I don't know
what we'll do without you.
Milady, why don't you recall
the Earl of Bothwell?
Let's have no more talk of Bothwell.
Hear me praise
the land of sunny Italy fair
Where you laugh and sing your lips off...
- You look surprised, my dear.
- I wish to be alone.
Alone?
<i>Madonna!</i>
- Ruthven! What are you doing here?
- Ask your husband.
Do you know?
<i>Madonna!</i>
Let me go!
Get out, all of you!
- We intend no harm, except to that traitor.
- Traitor?! My only friend!
Aye, too good a friend.
Your husband knows.
I know who the traitors in Scotland are!
Get out of my room!
Lay one hand on Rizzio
and I'll see you destroyed!
Try it - when Scotland finds out we've
killed a rogue in your own bedroom!
If he's done any wrong, I'll deliver him up
for trial, not to assassins.
<i>- Madonna!
- </i>
- After him!
David! David!
- Oh, no!
Oh, David!
Milords... Milords.
Justice. Justice!
<i>Madonna...</i>
You've not only murdered poor David.
You've ruined me, ruined yourself,
thrown a doubt on the child
I'm going to have - your child.
I only wanted my rights.
God forgive you - I shan't,
nor forgive myself for marrying you.
- Am I to follow David?
- There's no fear if you do as we say.
Do you hear that? So long as I'm their
prisoner and my husband backs them up.
I'm an unfaithful wife
and the people will turn against me.
- Enough!
- Before we go further, you'll sign this.
- A full pardon for all of us.
- Never!
- Sign it!
- Ruthven!
She's better off dead
if she doesn't sign it.
<i>We're better off. If she got away
without signing, we'd be done for.</i>
- This proves her guilt.
- Aye.
Sign it!
Sign it.
Ruthven! Bothwell's returned
to Edinburgh! He's marching here!
- How many men has he?
- A handful.
- Let him come.
- He'll raise people against us.
He won't have a chance.
Open the gates. Let him in.
We'll post ourselves
in the courtyard, give him a surprise.
No, wait!
I'll sign your pardon.
Aye, you'll sign it well enough
with Bothwell in danger.
Darnley, you'll stay here.
Guards!
Don't you see what you've done?
They'll kill Bothwell
as they killed poor David.
You're only their shield.
How long will they tolerate you
when I'm out of the way?
- Why did you do it?
- I wanted to win you back.
Oh, you're blind.
They had to have you in their scheme
to prove their lie that I dishonoured you.
But once they've dragged me down
before the people,
what use will they have for you then?
How long will you keep your crown?
You'll find yourself a prisoner,
as I am now.
You'll only be king as long as I'm queen.
You still have a chance to save yourself,
to save us both.
- How?
- Help me flee before they kill Bothwell.
- I can't. They'd kill me.
- Not if you're with me.
They'd run.
They'd leave Scotland, and you'd be safe.
- With you, Mary?
- Yes, with me.
- You'd forgive me, wouldn't leave me?
- I swear I'll never leave you.
Madam.
Her Majesty has retired to her bedroom.
- Stand guard there.
- Aye, milord.
Get Bothwell!
- Get her.
- Aye, the Queen.
- Where's the Queen?
- In her bedroom, milord.
- Where's Darnley?
- With the Queen, milord.
- Will Huntly and his clan join them?
- Huntly? Aye.
They'll have 10,000 before morning,
and they'll be after us.
- I'm getting out of Scotland.
- I'm with you.
- We're done for, Ruthven.
- Aye.
- She's tricked us.
- Never mind her.
- If ever I lay my hands on Darnley...
- It's every man for himself.
Get over the border while there's time.
No!
Mary Stuart has a son.
And I am only a barren stock.
Where's Moray?
Vanished with the other lords
who murdered David Rizzio.
I've failed.
Failed.
- No, I'll not let you hold the baby.
That's quite enough.
Careful now. Careful, milady.
- Jamie, Jamie.
- Keep your hand on his wee bit bottom.
Havers, but he's a load,
that boy is.
But the best man in Scotland,
if you ask me.
He's a bubbly Jock,
that's what he is.
He ought to be tucked up in bed,
that's where he ought to be.
But being that it's his birthday,
he's got to see his mother first.
Och, och,
if we don't spoil the bairn, it's a wonder.
He'll grow up into a great big man and
take care of me when I'm an old woman.
She's not much older now
than the wee man himself.
- Oh!
Happy birthday!
Your Majesty,
here's a present for him.
<i>Hoot, man!
What would he do with a claymore?</i>
Aye, wait till he grows up.
He'll need it.
- It was your father's, ma'am.
- My father's?
- I brought it from Inverness.
- Aye, he's a Stuart.
Aye.
I hope you won't need it, Jamie.
His Majesty, the King.
What a charming family scene!
- We were just admiring your son.
- Oh, were you, Bothwell?
Yes. He's a year old today. Of course,
that's why you came back from Glasgow.
- Nurse.
- Yes, milady. It's time he was in bed.
I'll put him to bed, sir.
Afraid my presence will contaminate him?
You know that's not true.
Why have you come back?
- Has Ruthven returned to Scotland?
- He wouldn't dare.
- I'd like to find him if he has.
- You'd like to have me out of the way too.
You'd have them all back.
You know what they'd do to me.
- You're not yourself.
- Ruthven's in Scotland. Morton, too.
- No, they're not.
- Oh, don't tell me!
You know all about it.
And you, too, Bothwell!
- You're overwrought. You need sleep.
- Sleep?
Not here.
What do you mean?
I'll not tell you.
You won't trick me again.
- I'm going to leave Scotland.
- You can't. You forget who you are.
What do I care for an empty title?
It's my life.
My life, I tell you!
They were my friends,
Moray and Ruthven.
You tricked me,
turned them against me.
You've never forgiven,
never forgotten about Rizzio.
- I kept my word.
- You've never loved me.
I love your son. Think of him.
You can't desert your own son.
I'll disown him.
- I'll deny him his father!
- Your Majesty!
Try and make him king of Scotland
and England then!
He doesn't mean it.
He can't.
I've...
I've kept my word with him.
I've endured every... insult
and every humiliation.
I've done everything but...
love him.
I've tried, but I...
I can't.
- I can't.
- Mary...
All I ask is to serve you,
be at your side.
Talk to me about Inverness.
Talk to me about something.
I have to hear somebody talk.
Ten o'clock and all's well!
<i>All's well!</i>
Be gone, quickly!
All my people!
A king of Scotland
cries out from his grave
for revenge against his murderer!
And is the assassin's name not known?
Those who were banished
have told me his name.
Aye, who was it
that coveted the hand of the queen?
Bothwell's his name!
Bothwell!
Hear, all ye people,
the prayer of that infant prince,
the child of him who was slain.
Judge...
and avenge my cause...
O Lord.
- Aye, you're my prisoners, Huntly!
- Shall I make a fight for it, lassie?
I want no blood shed on my account.
- Where are you taking us?
- Er... Dunbar Castle, Your Majesty.
- Well, Huntly?
- Man, man. Do you think I'm blind?
- How so?
- This abduction, as you call it.
<i>- That's my worry.
- No, 'tis hers.</i>
If you cannot pull the wool over my eyes,
how do you expect to fool all of Scotland?
I'll take care of myself, Huntly.
And of Mary.
Scotland can point no finger at her
if I marry her this way, against her will.
- Marry her?!
- Aye. Why not?
You're mad.
You're both mad.
I'd rather be dead, lassie,
than see this night ever come.
You're the Queen of Scotland and you let
the woman in you blind your senses.
Why, he's not even of our faith.
You've always stood by that until now.
If you're going with this,
there's nought but disaster ahead of you.
She has nothing to do with it,
I tell you.
If you feel that way,
draw your sword against me.
- I'll not draw mine against any friend.
- You'll have no friend.
Here, lassie. Take this, and turn it
on yourself if what you speak is true.
There's honour in that escape.
You may go if you wish, Huntly. Go back
to Edinburgh. Join Moray and the rest.
- Stir up the clans against me!
- They'll do that themselves.
You'll put yourselves
in Moray's power again.
Three of the clock and all's well!
- Are you afraid, my Mary?
- No.
- I'll send you back with Huntly.
- Why?
From the very beginning,
I've always belonged to you.
I knew it.
How vast the night is.
How bright and wonderful.
I've never seen it like this.
Nor I.
Aye, look there. Make a wish.
I have.
They say there's a star for each of us.
I used to imagine that when I was born,
God put a dark star in the sky,
a star nobody could ever see,
not even me.
And then one night I'd see a flash of light
and I'd see my star,
but it would be falling, and I'd be gone.
Aye.
Dark or bright,
I'll always follow your star, Mary.
It was dark because I...
I didn't really exist at all.
I was a dream and I was the one
who was dreaming it, too.
That's absurd, isn't it?
- Perhaps I didn't exist until I met you.
- Aye.
There was a memory
of being a child in a country like this.
And then they told me
that my father was dead, and I cried.
Then they told me
that I was Queen of Scotland.
It didn't mean as much to me as my dolls.
Then I was very important -
not to myself, but to grown-up people.
And then... then one day
I caught a glimpse of my star
and they took me away at night on a ship.
It was all so strange -
the sea vast like this.
The world seemed enormous.
And then we came to another land
and they told me it was France.
Everything different -
people singing, laughing.
They were all happier.
I learned to love it all.
After a while, I began to think
that I'd only dreamed Scotland,
that I'd go on forever
playing in the garden,
learning French,
studying, hearing music,
talking to four wise old men
who were my uncles.
One of them was the cardinal of Lorraine.
I liked him best.
He was always telling me I'd marry the
son of the king of France when I grew up.
That seemed silly.
He was just a boy.
We used to fight,
and then I'd chase him and he'd run away.
Aye. I was in France when
you married him. I've never forgotten.
All the pomp and ceremony,
and a great crowd before the cathedral,
and the pages carrying your long train.
You weren't even old enough
to be out of short dresses.
I was 16.
It was just an arrangement.
And then, one day,
his father was killed in a tournament
and everyone made a great fuss over me.
And I was Queen of France.
But before I could realise it all...
he died too, poor boy.
And then I was queen no longer.
And then I came back to my old dream,
to Scotland.
I was never in love.
You know that.
<i>Ego conjungo vos in matrimonium</i>
<i>in nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.</i>
Amen.
So, she summons all Scotland
to take up arms for her.
Will they come?
Only a rabble of mosstroopers from
the border, where Bothwell's strength lies.
Mercenaries.
They won't stand up and fight.
- Where's the child?
- Abducted by Moray.
They'll not harm her son.
Moray's strength depends on making him
king and ruling as regent till he is of age.
The lords have won most of Scotland
to their cause by convincing John Knox
that Bothwell and the Queen murdered
Darnley to get him out of their way.
Knox thunders it into the people.
And, after all, what greater proof of their
guilty love than this reckless marriage?
- And I believed I'd failed.
- We shall soon know, Your Majesty.
The lords are marching on Edinburgh
and they outnumber
Bothwell's defenders five to one.
Open the gate
for the host of the righteous!
Oh, my people, into what pit
of abomination have ye fallen?
'Tis not the true banner of Scotland
that ye follow,
but the blood-red banner
of murder and treason!
Remember, a king of Scotland
cries out from his grave to be avenged!
And will you defend
the guilty queen?
Open the gates
for the host of the righteous!
Open the gates!
Are you afraid, Mary?
Yes. Terribly, terribly.
Oh, that's not my Mary.
I'm only afraid for you.
Then you're not afraid at all.
Flag of truce!
Bowing comes
with a bad grace from traitors.
We are not in arms against you,
my sister. Only him.
Before you state your conditions,
Moray, I'll state mine.
We'll decide the issue
by single combat between you and me.
Or anyone else
you and the other traitors wish to appoint.
- No. They'll find some way to trick you.
- Hear Moray's conditions.
I beg you, madame.
I beg you, sir.
You owe it to the Queen.
Go ahead. What are they?
- First, that you leave Scotland forever.
- No.
What else?
That the Queen bind herself
to act only with our consent.
- No more?
- No more.
Then here are my conditions!
You've wanted my earldom.
Well, you may have it.
I'll leave Scotland
if you'll pledge your word the Queen's to
keep her throne and reign here as before.
But if you break your word
or encroach one inch on her sovereignty,
you guard your gates,
for I'll be back.
I'll see if your terms
are acceptable to milords.
Let me live or die at your side.
I'm your wife. I love you.
I love you, my Mary. What do I lose?
Nothing. You save your throne.
What's my throne? I'd put a torch to it
for any one of the days I've had with you.
- They've been so few.
- Aye, but wonderful days.
20 wonderful days.
Better than a lifetime.
- Take me with you.
- No. You're Queen. That's your destiny.
And I'll love you till the day I die.
That's mine.
Well, Moray?
The lords of Scotland accept your terms.
Very well.
I wouldn't trust Ruthven's pledge,
or Morton's.
But after all, corrupt as you are,
you're a Stuart, the son of a king.
I'll take your word as a Stuart.
But remember, Moray...
if you break your pledge,
if you ever raise your hand against her,
I'll be back.
Donal!
I'll say it to her milk-white face.
Pluck down the murderess!
Pluck down this contaminator of men!
If there's to be a council here,
send out this raving maniac!
Though you be a queen
and have faith in thy gods and idols,
yet in this night of reckoning
they shall not avail thee!
Moray, I demand his removal!
- Why don't you answer me?
- You shall have to leave your palace.
- That's at my choice, not yours.
- Not now.
I'm still your queen.
You gave your word
that I should rule as before.
That's impossible now.
Now...
I see your treachery.
You not only betray your sovereign,
you betray yourselves,
your own pledge!
- We defend Scotland!
- Aye!
You may remain here
if you'll sign what we dictate.
And what do you dictate?
Your abdication.
And your consent
to have your son crowned king.
And appoint me regent
till he comes of age.
- I refuse.
- We'll change your mind!
Remember Bothwell's warning.
He'll come.
- With his army disbanded?
- And a thousand crowns on his head?
So long as I live, no power on earth
shall take my throne away from me.
Come lock me up.
I'll bide my time and wait for Bothwell.
Milord Throckmorton,
ambassador to Scotland.
What news from Scotland?
- Bothwell has been defeated.
- Was he taken?
No, Your Majesty.
He escaped to Denmark
where he hopes to raise arms and money
for a final blow against Moray.
But I have more important news for you.
The son of Mary Stuart has been crowned
king, and Moray rules again as regent.
- Then she's abdicated!
- So Moray claims.
- She's still in prison?
- At Loch Leven. I've seen her.
She asks for Your Majesty's support
of her cause against the rebels,
and asks that you remember
that if you favour rebellion in Scotland,
you may eventually see it in England.
Rebellion.
How I hate that word.
Remember, Your Majesty, your security
depends upon her being behind bars.
Can I support rebellion...
so near to my own throne?
Remember that.
Neither can I afford to take sides,
so long as Bothwell lives.
If Moray's plans succeed,
he will be caged in Denmark for good
on some pretext or other.
Return to Scotland.
Tell Moray that in the eyes of the world
he is a rebel, a traitor.
Therefore I shall oppose him publicly...
Your Majesty.
...yet support him privately.
And Mary Stuart?
Give her this ring...
as a token of my friendship and support.
- But she will ask...
- I know what she'll ask.
And we'll put her off,
procrastinate.
Months. Years.
There's security in that.
I won't say I wasn't frightened
when you came tapping at the door
like a bird blown in off the sea.
Go sit down, ma'am.
It's poor vittles for fine folk, but it's
all we've got and you're welcome to it.
That's right. Sit down there.
I have a little boy like you.
Does he sit in a highchair too?
He wants to know
if he sits in a highchair, too.
Oh, yes. In a very high chair.
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.
Amen.
Thomas, who's that?
- Your Majesty.
- Do you come from Elizabeth?
Yes, Your Majesty. I have come
to conduct you to a place of security.
I thank Her Majesty.
I stand in need of her friendship now.
Thank you, my kind friend.
This will be your apartment,
Your Majesty.
Sir Francis Knollys,
your, er... host.
Thank you. Thank you.
How wonderful to be free again.
Where is Elizabeth?
Am I to see her now at last?
I want to thank her.
Where is she?
I place this lady in your custody, sir.
Custody?
What do you mean?
England has no jurisdiction over me.
I asked Elizabeth for refuge.
She promised it.
Am I her prisoner?
I demand an answer!
- Did you hear that?
- It's only the storm, sir.
Listen, Donal!
It's my pipers!
They're coming, I tell you!
- Lie down, sir, please.
- No, Donal, they're marching up, man!
We'll win yet!
- I thought I heard...
- Sir, lie down. Please, sir.
Oh!
Open up here! Open up here!
Open up!
- Still out of his mind.
- These Scotsmen have the devil in them.
Prison fever's a good match for the devil.
Open up here! Open up!
Sir, you're not yourself.
Please lie down.
I'm getting out, Donal.
I'm getting out. I'll get out tonight.
- Tonight, I tell you!
Ah!
- There it is again, you hear?
- What, sir?
The pipes, Donal. Listen.
Donal, go to England.
Find her.
Tell her I'm out, I'm free.
I'll free her, too. Tell her... tell her
she'll hear the pipes when I come to her.
Tell her to listen. Tell her my pipe...
my pipe... my pipers are coming.
Sir? Sir?
Speak. Speak to Donal, sir.
Oh! Oh, my laddie!
My laddie!
What's wrong with him?
You cannae hurt him now.
Aye, he spoke true.
He's free.
Bring in the prisoner.
Am I to see Elizabeth at last?
Her Majesty is present...
symbolically.
The accused will be seated.
I prefer to stand...
symbolically.
Do you acknowledge
the jurisdiction of this court?
Not of this court nor of Elizabeth.
There are no examples of sovereigns
condemned by courts of law.
In Rome, the tetrarch Cagetanus
was put to death by a trial.
There is another precedent.
Licinius, brother-in-law
of the emperor Constantine.
Not to forget Joanna of Naples.
You go back 1500 years?
Go back to Pontius Pilate,
who condemned to the cross a sovereign
greater than the world has ever known,
and remind Elizabeth what happened
to the memory of Pontius Pilate.
<i>Please remember
that you are the accused.</i>
Accused? Of what?
Of attempting to take the life of
our sovereign lady, the Queen of England.
I have lain in prison
ever since I came to this land.
Even had I wished it,
how could I make such an attempt?
By conspiring with certain English
subjects of your religious persuasion,
to wit Anthony Babington.
A true friend who sought only
to release me from unjust imprisonment.
- Where is he?
- Executed, for treason.
And his friends?
Executed, for treason.
Poor, generous friends.
So the first step to prove me guilty
is to murder those
who would prove me innocent.
The accused will confine herself
to answering questions,
not framing them.
I am the accuser here,
not the accused.
<i>I accuse Elizabeth of treachery
and plotting against my life,</i>
not I against hers.
Do you deny secretly communicating
with the aforesaid Anthony Babington?
Do any of you deny that you would try
to escape from unjust imprisonment?
Do you know what it means
to be shut up from everything you love?
From your husband?
Your... son? Your own people?
Confined like an animal
until each day grows so long
that it seems a lifetime?
Yes, I've smuggled out letters.
Isn't it true that you approved the plot
against the life of our queen?
As true as to say that you are honest men.
Isn't this letter in your own handwriting?!
The way you shout, milord, tells me
even at this distance that it is a forgery.
Will you confine yourself
to answering questions?
I have heard no questions,
only accusations phrased like questions.
But why prolong this mockery?
Elizabeth, fearing there might be a real
plot to kill her and put me on her throne,
has invented a false plot
so that I may be condemned to death.
But still she fears to spring her trap
because of Bothwell.
She knows he wins support
for my cause abroad.
And when he returns this time,
he'll carry the field in Scotland
and I'll be queen again.
While he lives, I'll live.
Bring in the other prisoner.
Your Majesty.
Donal.
I tried my best to reach you, ma'am,
but I couldnae get past your jailer,
and I was taken.
Donal,
where is he?
Where's Bothwell?
No.
No.
Oh..!
He... he spoke of you
at the last, ma'am.
He said...
he said he'd be waiting for you...
with the bagpipes playing.
And all the time...
you knew.
Now I see.
Now I understand.
Condemn me.
Kill me.
I don't care.
Ten of the clock and all's well!
All's well!
All's well!
Take pity on the weakness of my sex.
Strengthen me
as thou alone can strengthen.
Comfort me in this,
the hour of my agony.
And may thy will be done.
Elizabeth.
I've only seen a poor likeness...
but yes,
you are Elizabeth.
At last.
Aye.
A Stuart.
I see now why men love you.
Even now, standing where I am,
my last night in this world,
I wouldn't change places with Elizabeth.
I might've known you'd come to...
gloat like this.
Stealthily, under cover of night,
as you've done everything to destroy me.
And you've done nothing to destroy me?
- When was I your enemy?
- Always!
Always your life was a threat to mine.
How? Why?
You were born too close to my throne.
It was you or I.
A knife planted between my shoulders,
and my kingdom was yours.
I never wished it.
But you'd have taken it if it came.
Ah, yes.
You're not even a woman.
I'm a queen.
You've been a woman.
See where it's brought you.
It has brought me happiness
you'll never know, Elizabeth.
I wouldn't give up the memory
of one day with Bothwell
for a century of your life.
What do you know of my life?
You were born a queen.
Honours, thrones...
Everything fell into your lap.
What do you know
of the struggle for power?
I started with nothing, robbed even of
a name, not acknowledged by my father.
My own mother -
yes, Anne Boleyn -
was executed.
And I learned how a woman
may be a queen one day
and stand on the scaffold the next.
I was sent to the Tower by my own sister.
Oh, I know what prisons are
and being threatened
month after month with execution.
I died a thousand times.
But I fought my way upward,
inch by inch,
until I wore the crown.
I gave my love to no man,
but to my kingdom, to England.
And you prate to me of love.
What do you know of my life?
I know it's been a failure,
a magnificent failure.
It's you who failed, not I.
You threw away a kingdom for love,
for Bothwell.
Aye.
And I'd do it again a thousand times.
You were always afraid of me.
You're afraid of me still.
You know my blood will stain you.
You'll never wash it off.
And the pity of it is, Elizabeth,
that you and I,
we might have been friends.
Do you think I want your death?
- Mary Stuart, save yourself.
- How?
Renounce your Stuart claim to my throne,
sign your name to it.
Still driven by fear -
fear of me even dead.
- So that's why you came here tonight.
- Renounce your claim and live.
You've always loved power,
cherished it fiercely.
I've loved as a woman loves,
lost as a woman loses.
But still I win.
You have no heir.
My son will inherit your throne.
My son will rule England!
Still, still, I win!
Your Majesty...
it is time.
Your Majesty...
It is time.
Even...
Even as thine arms
were spread upon the cross...
so receive me into the arms of mercy.
And forgive me my sins.
<i>We hail from the burn side</i>
<i>The hills and the glens</i>
<i>When the pipes o' the queen
sound the call</i>
<i>And glad are the hearts</i>
<i>O'her loyal highland men</i>
<i>Whether victory or death</i>
<i>May befall</i>
<i>Tho' the road be long and drear</i>
<i>When the pibroch's ringing clear</i>
<i>With the skirl of Stuarts</i>
<i>Off to war</i>
<i>We will fight for our queen</i>
<i>She's the fairest ever seen</i>
<i>So the Scots may be free as of yore</i>
<i>For chains shall not bind us</i>
<i>No English yokes shall fall</i>
<i>Let us free Scotland for evermore</i>
<i>We will fight for our queen</i>
