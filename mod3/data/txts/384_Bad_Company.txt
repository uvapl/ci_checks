Your friend is late.
He'll be here.
Oh, yeah?
I do have other bidders.
I personally vouch for this man.
Oh, well,
I trust you, Michael, but...
you see, with each degree
of separation...
comes a degree of uncertainty.
Mr. Turner.
Mr. Vas.
The KGB once tried
to set me up...
so I had to kill
three of their agents...
and then I hunted down
their families.
The point is, if I sense
anything out of the ordinary--...
No, the point is, I haven't seen
anything from you yet...
to justify a payment
of $20 million.
So, before I hand over
a small fortune...
and risk my life,
I want to know 100%...
that you can, in fact,
deliver the device.
That's the point.
Very well.
Michel...owner's manual.
This is your show of good faith?
Well, you're still alive.
You consider that
a show of good faith.
-What do you have for me?
-Down payment--$ 1 million.
So, when do I get the device?
Let's say ten days.
Michael,
you take that telephone...
and I will call you
and tell you how to proceed.
You keep it on you all the time.
As for you, sir,
the next time we meet...
I suggest you be on time.
Nice coat.
Well done.
See you around.
-So far, so good?
-Yeah, so far.
-Kevin's got a tail.
-Is it Vas?
They don't look Russian,
but they don't look friendly.
We'd better go back for him.
You ordered us not
to jeopardize our cover, sir.
Hey, turn left.
Turn left!
Kill him!
-Ambush on the castle steps.
-Come on, faster. ...
Let's go!
Get down! Get down!
There he is! Pull over!
You're jeopardizing the mission.
You are the mission.
God, that was close.
Did you see who they were?
Kevin?
Doesn't this all smack
of extreme desperation?
A nuclear bomb that fits neatly
into a carry-on suitcase?
Kevin spends two years
getting close to these people...
in order to position you
as the buyer.
Vas won't deal
with anyone else...
and we have nine days
to make this work.
I'd say desperation
was the order of the day.
Maybe Vas set Kevin up.
My guess is,
it's a rival buyer.
Could be Pakistanis,
Chechnyans, North Koreans.
-Libyans.
-Try the entire Middle East.
Adrik Vas is a businessman.
He'll take anyone's money.
Why kill Kevin
if they could just outbid him?
We have deeper pockets.
He priced them out of the game.
-Who do you think it is?
-Well, the cold war is over.
These guys
don't wave flags anymore...
and fanaticism,
terrorism is global.
Whoever it is decided
to eliminate the competition...
and force Vas to deal with them.
So, the future
of the so-called free world...
may rest in
this young man's hands.
Jake Hayes here--
Big-time Tickets.
Whatever you want, I'll get you.
Yankees, third base line.
Knicks, courtside.
Rangers, on the ice.
Masters, I'll put you
on Tiger's tee, a'ight?
No matter what you want,
I got it for you.
Big-time Tickets.
What you need?
Come on, man. You call me
three hours before tip off...
against the Lakers?
The Knicks sell out every game.
Since I like you, for 850,
I'll get you section 24, row 9.
Twelve back from the bench.
Right behind Woody
with a good view of Spike...
unless he's got that
turban thing on his head...
lookin' like Yasser Araneck.
Check.
Hold on a second.
What's up? Big-time Tickets.
Jake Hayes. What you want?
Checkmate.
"Lion King"? I can't do that.
Jake Hayes here.
Big-time Tickets.
Mr. Johnson, you gonna
go to the game tonight...
or you want to do some business?
Shit, he's kickin' your ass!
Don't look at me.
You need to watch that castle...
'bout to bitch-slap your bishop.
Ehhhh! You lose, Opie.
Damn!
OK, so I'll give you
four hundred for the two.
-Yo, Jake, let's get a slice.
-Hold on one second.
Hello? Big-time Tickets.
Hey, man. I can't.
You always workin'.
Hey, honey. What's up?
OK, I'm gonna
pick you up from work.
Then we'll talk all about it.
Love you, too. Bye.
I gotta pick up
my girl, man.
So check this out--
you're gonna do this, right?
I'm gonna do this.
You're gonna do this.
I'm gonna do this.
Then you're gonna do this.
But I'm gonna do this...
and when you're
thinkin' about this...
I'm gonna do this.
Then the game's over.
So why don't you
give me $20 right now...
-and we'll save twenty minutes?
-Screw you.
You didn't know chess
was a contact sport, did you?
Hey, honey.
Julia Benson.
She's a nurse's aide.
They've been together
three years.
She lives with her sister
and brother-in-law...
in Jersey City.
Amazing resemblance
to Kevin, sir.
Yeah.
Like seeing a ghost.
I don't know how
you're gonna react.
Come on. Wait a minute.
I should've known.
The mood swings,
the weight gain.
What weight gain?
You're pregnant.
I want everybody to know.
Hey, everybody!
My woman's havin' a baby,
and we're gettin' married!
I'm not pregnant.
We don't have to get married.
Marriage is a big step.
We should wait a while.
We're young.
I'm moving to Seattle.
Seattle, like,
Seattle Supersonics, Seattle?
Wait a minute.
That's pretty far.
I got offered a job there.
What kind of job
are you gonna get in Seattle...
that you can't get in New York?
A friend of mine
from junior college called.
-Who?
-Kenneth.
Your ex-man Ken?
He's managing a company
out there, and he offered.
So, you're leaving me
and going back to Ken.
No.
-Are you leaving me?
-Sort of, but it's not--...
So, you're leaving me
and going back to Kenneth?
-That's what I asked you.
-The Ken part is just business.
And what's the leaving me part?
Pleasure?
Pain.
Your sister put you up to this.
She never liked me.
-It's been three years, Jake.
-I know it's been three years.
We're in the same situation
that we were in when we met.
Meaning, we're not married.
We're not married,
we can't afford to get married.
And it doesn't look like
it's ever gonna change.
You know, poor people
do get married.
I know, but I don't feel
like fighting with you...
every day because we're broke.
Marriage is hard enough
without being poor.
Hey, what happened to the love?
What happened
to all that romance?
You know I love you.
But you are living
in this fantasy.
It's like you're waiting
for some kind of miracle.
I gotta live in reality.
I am not gonna be young forever.
So you gotta put yourself
back on the market...
while the merchandise
is still fresh.
You act like there's
a damn expiration date...
on your forehead!
Come on, come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You think I like
living like this?
Movin' tickets, hustlin' chess,
DJing at these little clubs?
I should've stayed in college.
I messed up.
I messed up.
I'll go back to college.
I love you, Jake.
I love you, too.
But l--...
So, when are you leaving?
Couple weeks. But l--
We'll talk before then.
Why?
Jake.
-What's up, man?
-Hey, what's up?
-What's wrong?
-Julie left me.
Sorry. I gotta go.
But I'll catch you tomorrow.
Hey, you get
your shit together...
or I'm gonna have
to fire your ass!
That's right!
Julie, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Big-time Tickets.
Yeah, for what game?
How much you want to spend?
Yeah, I can get it.
So. where you at?
Where the hell's that?
Thank you very much.
Now, take off.
Whatever.
-Hop out.
-Hey, what's up?
-Give me your phone.
-What's up?
Hey! Come on, now!
What y'all want?
-Hey, come on!
-Relax.
You know how hard it was for me
to get a cab to come up here?
I hope y'all givin' me
a ride back.
I know you're cops, man.
What do you want, money?
Oh, I understand.
Y'all shot somebody,
and now y'all need a suspect.
Mr. Hayes? Jacob Hayes?
I'm Officer Oakes,
that's Officer Seale...
Officer Swanson, Officer Carew.
CIA? What's that for?
"Crackers In my Ass?"
You're gonna arrest me
for scalpin' tickets?
We just want to talk to you
about something.
-About what?
-About your brother.
You got the wrong guy.
I don't even have a brother.
That's just a picture
of me in a suit.
You could've got that
off the internet.
I saw a picture of Bill Gates
with three titties on the net.
OK, September 8, 1970...
Bellevue Hospital,
New York City...
a woman registered
as Mary Jeffries...
gives birth
to identical twins...
but suffers complications
and dies the next day.
-What about the father?
-Thomas B. Jeffries.
Presumed alive.
Whereabouts unknown.
The state
rarely separates twins...
but one of the infants--
Jacob--that's you--...
was diagnosed
with severe lung infection.
You still have the scar
from the chest tube...
the incision mark.
An administrator at the hospital
altered the birth record...
to give the healthy child
a better chance at adoption.
A week later,
Roger and Glenda Pope...
took in Kevin Jeffries.
The Popes never knew.
Kevin never knew.
So, I have a twin brother.
Big deal.
What's the CIA
have to do with this?
He couldn't send me a letter?
Your brother's dead.
How?
A helicopter crash.
We need your help, Mr. Hayes.
Your brother was working
on something with us.
My twin brother was CIA?
Yeah, a clandestine operative.
And just before he was killed,
he set up a deal.
What kind of deal?
A very important one.
So, we need you to stand
in for him, just briefly.
-Pretend I'm him?
-Yeah.
-For how long?
-Nine days.
Nine days is not standin' in.
Standin' in is an hour.
Nine days is goin' on tour.
-Is this shit dangerous?
-There's some risk.
What kind of risk?
We talkin' bad credit risk...
or a bullet in the ass risk?
-You'd be well compensated.
-For a bullet in the ass risk?
I hope that's a lot
of compensation. How much?
Throw out a number.
-A billion dollars.
-You've overshot.
I don't know what kind of budget
you're working with.
We were thinking
somewhere in the region of...
let's say...$25,000.
Fifty. Yeah, fifty.
I figure you started with 25,
so I know you got more.
You ain't gonna give me
all your money. 50,000.
This is what I'm thinking,
Mr. Hayes.
With $25,000, your girlfriend
Julie could go to college.
She wouldn't have to go
to Seattle.
Or work with Ken.
OK, here's what I'm thinkin'.
You're gonna give me
$50,000 tax-free.
OK, 50,000 after taxes
after the job is done.
Half now, half after.
Ten now, forty after.
Unless my mother had triplets...
you're gonna give me ten now,
ninety after.
OK, you got a deal.
-So, when do we start?
-Now.
This is your brother's file.
Study it.
This is your brother's file.
Study it.
So there's homework.
-Preparation.
-OK.
Let's see, Dad sits on the board
of the New York Stock Exchange.
Mom, co-artistic director...
at Lincoln Center.
Must've been nice.
In my foster house,
we were so poor...
we used to lick stamps
for dinner.
Let's see.
Prep school at Exeter.
Then college at Dartmouth.
Served in the Naval Academy.
-That's right.
-What'd he serve, lunch?
Oh, man. "Rhoades scholar."
-So my brother was real smart?
-Yeah.
Damn, the CIA is cheap.
Y'all could've got me
a queen size.
What's this, jack size?
Hey, what's "Záchod" mean?
It's Czech for "bathroom."
You'll find the room labeled
with phonetic translations.
Why?
Because the deal goes down
in the Czech Republic.
-Czech Republic?
-Here's a dictionary.
How do I get an outside line?
I need somebody to feed my cat.
You don't have
an outside line or a cat.
So what am I
supposed to be doing here?
There's a tape in the VCR.
It's a video of your brother.
Watch it. The way he talks
and the way he moves.
I know there's a lot
to deal with here...
but we're all behind you.
We'll start in the morning.
You got any questions?
Yeah, if my brother
was such a genius...
then how come he's dead?
-5 A.M.
-Hey, I don't do 5 A.M.
So, bottom line,
what are our chances?
I'd say anywhere between
nil and zero.
Why do you say that?
I grant you,
he's got potential.
He's pretty street-smart.
In 6 months, he could probably
fool his brother's parents.
But eight days?
You gotta be kidding.
Probably get himself
killed on this mission...
and anyone else
who goes along with him.
Would you like to be replaced
on the mission?
Why? You're going ahead
with or without me?
That's precisely
what I'm saying.
Well, sir, when do I tell him
what this mission involves?
If I were you, I would tell him
as little as possible.
Don't put anything
into his head he can't use...
and certainly nothing that
could pop out at the wrong time.
-OK.
-What's he doing now?
He's studying.
We told him to learn...
a few key phrases in Czech.
He seems dedicated.
What's he saying?
He said, "I haven't had
my period in three months."
Now what?
"Where's the hospital?
I have a vaginal infection."
This is gonna be
really interesting.
Can't wait to get started.
Rise and shine, Mr. Hayes!
5 A.M., and all is well.
How about three more hours
of sleep and some breakfast?
How about a nice shower?
Aah! Aah! Hey!
What's wrong with you?!
Good morning.
Today we'll be covering
basic operations protocol...
for the acquisition
of foreign assets...
a procedure we like to call
"The Three I's"--...
identifying the target,
initiating the contact...
and infiltrating the network...
Now you do it like him.
Man, this is buggin' me out.
I feel like Michael Jackson...
lookin' at old album covers.
Look at this guy.
He looks like me,
but it's not me.
-Yeah.
-So, what did he like to do?
What kind of sports was he into?
What kind of music
did he listen to?
He liked music.
Jazz and classical.
-Classical, like Run-DMC?
-He didn't like rap.
What 29-year-old brother
don't like a little bit of rap?
He didn't listen to rap.
So, what kind of sports
was he into?
Skiing.
OK, so you got skiing,
the Navy, no rap.
We'd have had a lot in common.
-Sir.
-Hmm?
What time?
OK. All right.
Thanks.
So, what's up with
you and Swanson?
-Hmm?
-Aw, come on, man.
I see there's something
goin' on there.
You got a little
something goin' on. ...
Look at you. You're blushing.
Do you mind if I say something
to you, Mr. Hayes?
My friends, Officer Seale,
Officer Swanson...
they have faith in you.
I don't.
And that creates a problem...
because you're in so deep
with us now...
we can never let you go.
So you'd better
learn this stuff...
stone-cold by 0500 hours
tomorrow morning.
Or what?
I'll kill you.
Can we start
a few hours later tomorrow?
Get dressed.
It's 4:59!
Swirl.
Checking for sediment.
Sniff...
And taste.
Morning, Mr. Hayes. 5 A.M.
No, 5:01 .
Pope. Kevin Pope.
Look at this suit.
Man, I got initials on my cuffs.
The only thing I ever have
on my cuffs is steak sauce.
They say "M.T."
What's that for?
Michael Turner.
But I thought I was Kevin Pope.
Kevin Pope is Michael Turner.
Michael Turner
is Kevin Pope's cover identity.
He is a very successful,
very knowledgeable...
very sophisticated
international dealer...
in fine antiquities.
Well, if I'm Jake Hayes
playing Kevin Pope...
playing Michael Turner,
then I should get two checks.
Cheers.
This is a very rare
expensive cognac.
What do you think?
Dry. But never precocious.
I love your shirt.
Egyptian broadcloth?
Three days.
Pretty impressive.
Yeah, he's bright.
-I think he can do it.
-He's got my vote.
I said he was bright.
I didn't say he was capable
of saving the world.
-Let's run a real test.
-Like what?
Send him up to New York.
Put him in Kevin's apartment.
Let the neighbors, the doorman,
everybody get a look at him.
See if they buy him
as Michael Turner.
Might even serve
a double purpose.
Whoever tried to kill
Kevin as Michael Turner...
probably doesn't know he's dead.
Might still be looking for him.
So we dangle him as bait,
keep him in the dark.
-He'll be protected.
-What do we tell him?
You're giving him a chance
to practice being Kevin.
That's all you need to tell him.
You're the boss.
You see the van
in front of us?
The one behind us?
Those are our guys.
Here's my cell phone number.
Use it if you get
into any kind of trouble.
-What kind of trouble?
-Any kind.
Shark attack?
Call you. All right.
Could you pop the trunk?
Take this.
Get yourself some shoes.
Little punk.
Mr. Turner, welcome back, sir.
Thanks, Jim.
How was Europe?
Like another country.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Whoo!
You could put this on MTV Cribs.
Man, this is dope!
God damn.
So if I paid taxes...
this is where
the money would go, huh?
Could have
a Puffy party in here.
Let's get some music in here.
What's that music?
-Just hip-hop stuff.
-It's terrible.
Jake, it's your
downstairs neighbor...
Mrs. Patterson.
Don't forget the radio.
OK.
Hi, Michael! Welcome back.
-Vera, how are you?
-Fine, thank you.
Hi, Annabella.
We just came in and the doorman
said you were back.
-Annabella missed you.
-Oh, you're far too kind.
I've been waiting desperately
for you to come back.
-Oh? Why?
-I bought a little treasure.
Come on down and tell me
if I got a good buy.
-Oh, OK.
-Hold your baby.
-Yes, my baby.
-How was your trip?
This is gonna be a disaster.
Hello! Go see your nanny, baby.
What do you think?
Is it a good piece?
Uh...
-It's exquisite.
-Ooh! Do you think?
Go ahead, pick it up. Feel it.
Just see how delicate it is.
Pick it up, right?
Yes. Just grab it
and pick it up.
Michael...
that's what we keep
the doggy treats in.
Of course, I knew that.
I was just getting it...
out of the way
so I could see the--...
-The vase.
-Of course, the vase! Yes!
May I ask, how much
did you pay for this?
150,000.
Good lord! What you gonna
put in it, cocaine?!
He fooled the doorman,
he fooled the neighbor...
and the neighbor's dog.
What more do you want?
Oakes, we need to know
who's after that bomb.
You're willing
to sacrifice him to find out?
Don't be dramatic.
He's got plenty of protection.
I'll tell you when to pull him.
Hope y'all not watching this.
I don't have
to watch this, do l, sir?
-Oh, no. Holy shit.
-Code red. Code red.
Code red! Code red!
Parish, McCain, cover the exits!
Help! Help! Help!
God.
Sir, he's headed for the roof.
-We need him alive.
-Yes, sir.
Drop the knife.
Hey, Elvis, if you drop
the knife and step down...
no one is gonna hurt you.
So...
who's got Jake?
Well, these last
ten minutes will be used...
as a teaching aid on how
an operation can get totally--...
-Screwed up, sir?
-Thank you.
We'll find him, sir.
Yeah? Where are you?
The corner of eat shit
and fuck you!
I'm not gonna let you trace me!
Bye! I'll call you back!
I'm stuck in traffic.
I ask you to do--...
Give me that!
Yo!
Run fingerprints, DNA,
anything we can get...
on the guy
who jumped off the roof.
-Yes, sir.
-He looks Afghani, sir.
Don't assume anything.
Just find Jake.
-Yes, sir.
-Jake--...
Kevin was murdered!
And they're gonna murder me!
-Let's meet some place--
-No more bullshit!
We lost him
because we lied to him.
No, you lost him
because you lost him.
We treated him like an idiot.
He had a right to know
what we were doing with him.
We're wasting time!
Find him and bring him back...
and spare me your conscience.
Spare my conscience.
-Take it easy, buddy.
-Bye.
Yeah?
Hello? Pam, it's Jake.
Can I talk to Julie?
-She don't want to talk to you.
-Who's on the phone?
I need to talk to Julie.
Please. This is serious.
It is Jake?
Wait, let me talk to him!
-She's moving on.
-Give me the phone.
We don't need
no more trouble, Jake...
and you ain't nothing
but trouble.
Two suits came around today
looking for you.
Give me the phone!
Hey, hey, hey.
Shit, your phone's tapped.
If Julie's there,
tell her I love her...
and, Oakes, if you're listening,
kiss my ass!
-You get a trace?
-No.
Tch. He hung up.
Mr. Hayes, where are you?
Where in the hell are you?
Ma.
-Help! Help!
-Ma!
-Ma! Ma! Ma!
-Somebody help!
Ma, please! It's me!
Ma, it's me!
Jakey?
Yeah, yeah.
You gonna break my arm.
Well, what are you doing
in the dark?
Some people are looking for me.
-What did you do?
-I didn't do nothin'!
It's not what you think.
It's not the police.
It's way too hard to explain.
Look at this.
Eight foster kids I've taken
into my house over the years...
and all of them made something
of themselves...
and not one of them
had your potential!
Oh, come on, Ma!
Sellin', scramblin'
and hustlin'.
Ma, did you know
I had a brother?
Stop talking crazy.
You had lots of brothers.
How's that nice girl
I met last Christmas?
She left me.
Hand me that umbrella
so I can hit you again.
You know, Ma,
maybe it wasn't my fault?
-You need money?
-No.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, I need money.
How much do you need?
I won $250 at bingo.
It's just for a little while.
I'll pay you back.
I know.
Want something to eat?
You know what?
I really gotta go.
I'm never giving up
on you, Jakey.
You're going to do something
to make me very proud one day.
I know it.
I owe you an apology.
You hear me?
I was just wondering how many
of your people are listening in.
We're alone.
No cameras, no wires.
Just me.
You got the floor.
Your brother was assassinated.
By the same guys
who came after me, right?
I guess so.
Doing the same job as you.
Which is what?
Your brother,
as Michael Turner...
was helping me buy something
off the black market.
What? Cuban cigars?
PlayStation 3? What?
I can't tell you if you're not
coming back in with us.
I'm not comin' back in
if you ain't telling me.
Your brother died saving
my life. Did you know that?
Wish it had been otherwise,
but that's the way it is.
How are his parents taking it?
You didn't tell his parents?
No. That's the way we want it.
How would you feel if you died
and nobody told your wife?
I'm not married.
-There's no Mrs. Spy?
-Not anymore.
Relationships and attachments
are useless in this business.
So that's how this job is.
Even if they don't shoot you,
they take your life. ...
I know it sounds hokey,
but I honestly believe...
our lives are about something
bigger than ourselves...
and I'm offering you a chance
to commit yourself to something.
You ain't offering me nothin'...
but a chance
at a bullet in my ass.
I don't see
the higher meaning in that.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
-Thank you.
-No problem.
I'll go and sit in the car
and count to ten...
and if you want to join me,
fine, and if not...
I'll tell the agency
I couldn't find you.
We can't pull this job off
without you.
We need you.
Tch.
Think about it.
Oh, well.
That didn't work, did it?
No.
"I'm gonna go outside
and count to ten"?
Who the hell are you?
You'd have done better with
"Bitch, get in the car."
OK. Get in the car...
bitch.
This is the man
who tried to kill you.
We now know that he's a member
of a multi-national...
terrorist organization
led by this man.
Meet the man
who killed your brother--...
Dragan Adjanic.
He's wanted by The Hague
for terrorist crimes...
against humanity,
so he's a fugitive...
everywhere in the world,
including his own country.
He calls his movement
"The Black Hand."
His members
take a death pledge...
becoming suicide soldiers
to further their cause.
Last year, the FBI
caught four of his men...
in a Washington, D.C. motel...
with enough urea nitrate
to level the Capitol building.
He doesn't like America
and he doesn't like you.
-Wait a minute. What did I do?
-He's your rival buyer.
For the item
that this man has to sell.
Now, this is Adrik Vas.
He's a Russian ex-army colonel,
kingpin in the Russian mafia.
Up to his neck in prostitution,
drugs, and extortion.
Sounds like anybody
I went to high school with.
This is Vas's right-hand man.
His name is Michel Petrov...
otherwise known as "The Hammer."
Remember these faces...
because you're going
to be seeing them soon.
Why do they call this guy
The Hammer?
Whoa! Ooh.
Aah! Wha--what?!
Good evening. Isn't this fun?
This is an exercise
known as King's Game.
It's meant to test
your awareness.
What can you tell me
about your attackers?
They woke me up. Look, man,
if you want me to spy...
-I'm gonna need my rest.
-How many were there?
Didn't I just say
they woke me up?!
That's the weird thing
about an ambush.
Next time
we'll try and warn you.
Do you understand
what happened to you just now?
-Yeah. I was jacked!
-No, you panicked.
When you thought you were
in danger, your brain shut down.
So what's the point
of having a good brain...
if you can't keep it operating?
My brain didn't shut down.
I knew it was Swanson...
'cause I could feel her tits
on my back.
I knew it was Carew 'cause
his breath smelled like shit.
Probably from kissing
your ass so much.
I knew it was Seale
because I took his wallet.
Hey, Seale, why's a married man
need a condom? Your wife know?
You want to know
how I knew it was you?
OK, thank you.
Game's over. Good night.
Oh, where you going?
You gonna leave like that?
Come back!
Y'all got me up!
Let's do something!
Let's hit a club or something.
Based on our
intelligence projections...
and the text manual
provided by Agent Pope...
this is a mock-up
of what you'll be buying.
Does it play DVDs?
It's a portable
thermonuclear weapon.
-So that's a bomb?
-lt's a reproduction.
Last year,
a Russian suitcase bomb...
was stolen from a dismantling
facility in the Ural mountains.
Your brother tracked it down,
we need you to recover it.
Two things
you're gonna have to do--...
Would one of them
be shittin' in my pants?
Welcome to Prague.
Looks like Newark.
Welcome back to the hotel,
Mr. Turner.
Thank you.
Mr. Turner. So glad
to have you back, sir.
Thank you, Lempenka.
Hope you haven't
given out my room.
Certainly not, sir.
This is beautiful.
Her name is Lenka.
You just called her "Lempenka,"
which means "cardboard."
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh ho ho ho!
Man, it's gonna be hard
to go back to Jersey.
We'll be in the suite
across the hall...
with full video and audio
surveillance of this room.
All right, now,
when I go to the bathroom...
press the pause button.
Just stay in the room. You've
got nothing to worry about.
Except for my little date
with a nuclear bomb.
OK, this is our lifeline.
Our only link to Adrik Vas.
Nothing happens till he calls.
Don't let it out of your sight.
And remember, from now on,
there's no Jake...
there's no Kevin,
only Michael Turner.
Well...
I think I'm gonna like
being Michael Turner.
Think maybe you want
to take a look at this.
OK, what the hell's
he up to now?
Hey!
Fish egg?
Beluga, sir.
It's 12,000 crowns an ounce.
Party's over.
Naw, the party just started.
Soon as y'all leave...
I'm gonna have my ass buffed.
Hey! This little piggy
go to market...
Make sure you put
my initials on the big toe.
People need to know
whose feet this is.
That's Vas.
Where's the cell phone?
Phone, phone, phone.
Thank you.
Shhh!
Hello?
Yeah, we'll be there.
It's Vas.
The deal's on in an hour.
Now your eye.
Now your eye.
Look right into
the computer screen.
Blink for confirmation.
OK, that's it.
All right.
From this point on...
only you will be able
to access your computer.
It won't operate without
your retinal signature--...
your eyes--so when they show you
the bomb, connect your laptop...
determine if the bomb
is the real thing...
and take enough time doing it...
so Wells can download
their arming codes...
and hopefully
their disarming codes...
into our computenr.
Good luck. Mr. Hayes.
We have visual.
You'll do fine.
Everyone's nervous
the first day of school.
I always cut
the first day of school.
Don't worry. You're covered
from every angle.
I can't wait to meet
"The Hammer."
Oh, these guys
must be "The Toolbox."
Should we move in, sir?
No. Not until we're sure
they brought the bomb.
There's too much at stake.
Nice coat.
Gentlemen, are we going
to do business or aren't we?
Depends, Michael.
Where have you been
for the last nine days?
I don't believe
that concerns you.
On the contrary.
It concerns me very much.
We make a deal, you disappear.
Doesn't look good, my friend.
Heads up, McCain.
Be advised, targets are armed.
Maintain your positions.
Everyone maintain your position.
Copy that, sir.
Do we have a problem?
I don't know. You tell me.
Do we have a problem?
Do we?
Give me the cell phone
I gave you earlier.
Don't worry.
I only made collect calls.
Look, I don't know what
this is about, but--...
No, you don't, so shut up.
Neither does Mr. Turner.
You see, this cell phone
has a global positioning system.
In a moment, it'll tell me
exactly where you've been...
the last nine days.
Fantastic, eh?
Well, haven't you been busy?
Oh, you get around.
Berlin, Rome, Zurich. Heh.
And not one decent treasure
to show for it.
Now, where's the money?
Where's the product?
Nearby.
So, how do we do this?
I'm gonna call you
on this cell phone...
then you have one hour
to get the money, Michael.
Then I'll call you again
and tell you...
where to bring it to.
You understand?
I'm gonna have to run
some tests...
so make sure you bring
authentic merchandise.
Fair enough.
I wouldn't buy a car...
without checking
under the hood. Ha!
Are we agreed?
Yes.
No. We're not
bringing money anywhere.
No?
I'll have someone transfer
the remaining 19 million...
when Mr. Turner tells us
we have a viable device.
It'll be done by computer.
One of my men will be
standing by at this address.
You will send
one of your brain trusts...
to verify the money is in
your account, and that's it.
Give you a hostage?
And you get one. We'll call it
a security deposit...
which neither of us
will get back if we screw up...
or if we leave a mess.
It's that simple.
Now we have an agreement,
I think.
Agreed.
Don't you go disappearing
on me again, Michael.
Hey, you did real well,
Mr. Hayes.
Hey, you did real well,
Mr. Hayes.
You knew they wouldn't
bring it, right?
Uh-huh.
Standard procedure.
Guys like him won't risk...
getting screwed
on the first date.
What if you hadn't changed
the chip in the phone?
It would have told him
that the phone had already...
traveled to CIA
headquarters in Langley...
and they would have shot
both of us in the heads.
-I'm hungry. How about you?
-I'm gonna pass.
Then good night.
Oh! Michael!
Hi.
This place comes
with everything, huh?
Could you get me a towel?
Very funny. Ahem.
I knew you'd be surprised.
I didn't think you'd be shocked.
Aw.
You want some room service?
No. I'd like a good stiff drink.
-Oh, shit. It's Nicole.
-What?
This isn't exactly
the welcome I expected.
Wassup?
Honey, I made
dinner reservations...
-at our favorite place.
-I love that place.
Honey, aren't you happy
to see me?
-Yeah.
-Good.
-Aah.
-Mm.
I gotta get that.
I'll be right back.
How are you doing?
-You see how I'm doing.
-Yeah. We have a problem.
Where I'm from,
people pay a lot of money...
for problems like that.
That's Nicole.
That's Michael's girlfriend.
She works for CNN in Europe.
So how come didn't you tell me
Michael had a girlfriend?
Well, they broke up
several weeks ago.
They had a fight,
and she walked out.
Well, it looks like
she forgave him.
What the hell did he fight
with her fine ass for?
Well, apparently
he had intimacy problems.
He was distant,
some kind of psychotherapy crap.
Anyway, she went off
to cover the Balkans.
OK, so what do you
want me to do?
Take her to dinner. She's CNN.
If you handle this badly,
she could blow your cover. OK?
-OK.
-Good.
...Cheat.
Just...don't cheat...
just...don't cheat...
just...don't cheat...
just say...
That was Jehovah's Witnesses!
-Just...
-Michael...
I hope you're hungry, baby.
Yeah, I just gotta
go brush my teeth.
Hey! You've reached
the residence of Pam...
Manvin. Julie. and the kids.
Leave a message at the tone.
Julie, it's Jake.
Are you there?
OK, if you haven't left yet,
please wait for me.
Please, please. I got a new job.
It's totally legit.
And I've changed.
I've totally changed.
I'm a new man.
I'm the man who loves you.
I love you. I love you so much.
I didn't even know how much
I loved you till 2 minutes ago.
It's Jake.
-Julie!
-I love him!
No, you don't!
Honey, what's taking you
so long?
Big sacrifices.
Please wait for me.
Please wait for me.
Jake, I heard you.
I heard every word, baby.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be right here.
I love you so much!
Jake?
If you'd like
to make a call...
Jake? Hello! Jake!
If you'd like to make a call...
Thank you.
So are you gonna make me grovel?
No, not unless you want to.
Is this fish?
Yeah, of course. You love fish.
That's right. I love fish...
but that's before
I became a vegetarian.
Oh, waiter, waiter!
I can't eat this.
Can you get me something else?
How about a steak,
medium well, please.
-Of course, sir.
-Ah, thanks a lot.
I thought
you were a vegetarian.
Vegetarian? I'll eat a pig's ass
if they cook it right.
But enough about me.
How about those Balkans?
I missed you, Michael.
I'm sorry I left.
What's the matter?
There's somebody else.
There is? Hmm.
When did that happen?
-Right after you left.
-I left you two weeks ago.
I mean...
Did you meet her here in Prague?
No, in Jersey.
New Jersey?
Yeah, I was in New York...
and Jersey's
right next to New York...
and I just took
a little day trip.
Who is she? What does she do?
She's a nurse's aide
at Saint Sebastian's Hospital.
Her name's Julie.
She's got curly hair.
I get it.
You want me to jump
through a couple of hoops...
before you take me back.
OK. I have it comin'.
But I'm willing to work for it.
Ah-ah-ah--Nicole!
You hurt me really bad.
And I can't just let you
yo-yo with my heart, OK?
You hurt me, and I'm never
gonna let it happen again!
Love don't live here anymore!
Michael, I've never
seen you like this.
So...open.
So...so in touch
with your feelings.
Like you could really be in love
with a nurse from New Jersey.
You're just much more--...
mmm...warm and vulnerable
and funny!
You didn't used
to be funny before.
That's funny "ha ha" funny...
or funny "this milk
tastes funny" funny?
See? That's funny!
You're not Michael Turner.
