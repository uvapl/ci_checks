(MAN SNORING)
MAN: (WHISPERING) Mr Happer.
Mr Happer, sir.
(WHISPERING) The main business today,
gentlemen,
is the report on the progress
of our acquisition of Scotland
that is, part of Scotland,
for the refinery and storage base.
I've got a few things to show you.
You know we have a two-year lead
in North Atlantic development.
We can double this,
if we could streamline
the processing end of things onshore.
The pipeline is well on its way
from all three production areas
and we have a site for the terminal
right here.
-What about the site acquisition?
-MAN 2: (WHISPERING) It's critical.
The survey teams have found
just about the only suitable bay
on the entire coast.
Total investment is 600 million,
spread over the next three fiscals.
We've got to buy Ferness Bay
for $60 million.
And we're dealing with close
and stable allies of the US
not to mention the links, historically,
between Knox Oil and Scotland.
We're not in
a Third World situation here.
I think we should get a negotiator
on the site right away.
Do I really have to go there?
I'm more of a telex man.
I could fix the deals in an afternoon
over the phone,
like with Salinas last year.
It's not like Mexico, MacIntyre.
We're dealing with people
like ourselves.
You're a Scot.
You'll be dealing with your own people.
That's why you're going. You won't be
dealing with a bunch of Indians.
Cal, look after Africa
for me while I'm gone?
CAL: <i>All of Africa?</i>
No, just the West Coast deals.
Sarah's got the files.
We've got the Congo development
minister's tit in the wringer
so squeeze another five percent
of the crude oil gross out of him,
I think we can close this deal.
<i>What abo</i>u<i>t the tanker franchise?</i>
I want franchises
in all three territories.
I think a couple of telexes
should do it,
and put a five-day deadline
on the offer.
<i>Yo</i>u <i>got it</i>.
You want to eat? Eat. You want to eat?
Cal, I got a confession to make.
I'm not Scottish.
Man, oh, man.
-Think I should tell Fountain?
-Hell, no.
Don't spoil the fun. Take the trip.
My folks changed their name
when they got off the boat from Hungary.
They thought that MacIntyre
was American.
Jesus, Mac.
You're not a Scotsman,
you're not a Texan.
MAC:
I can't even pronounce my last name.
Comets are important.
They could be
the key to the universe, maybe.
And what are you going to call this
comet, if and when you find it, Happer?
The Happer Comet or Happer's Comet
or Comet Happer.
I thought it might be!
The whole world'll weep with gratitude,
Happer, when the big day comes.
''Mr Happer's got his comet. Hooray!''
What an empty, hollow,
wasteful activity.
You're chasing comets around the sky.
Is your life around you so complete?
What about a wife, children, a family?
Are these human goals
too simple for you?
Get out, Moritz. That's enough
for today. I got some meetings soon.
Go on, out. Out, out, out, out, out!
Yes, sir, Mr Happer.
It seemed to go pretty well today,
didn't it, sir?
It was okay, Moritz.
In fact,
I think we could build up the sessions.
Maybe two or three a week,
at the same fee, of course.
We're at a crucial stage.
Check with Mrs Wyatt on the way out.
Fix a half hour for Friday.
Maybe I could give you
an abusive phone call some night.
Any time that's inconvenient.
The surprise element might do
a lot of good... I mean, harm.
Out!
Moritz!
Did you mean all that stuff
about me being a flop?
God, no, Mr Happer!
It's basic therapy technique.
Sometimes I get carried away.
You think if I had married
that things would be different?
By no means, Mr Happer.
The modern world
offers many alternatives
to the security of the family unit.
Look at me, Mr Happer.
I'm a single man.
Get out.
Mrs Wyatt,
who are we sending to Scotland
on that refinery deal?
MRS WYATT:
<i>Mr Crabbe has selected Mr MacIntyre</i>
<i>of Acq</i>u<i>isitions for the trip</i>, <i>sir</i>.
<i>His Scottish connections</i>
<i>seem to fit the bill</i>
<i>and he handled Mexico</i>
<i>pretty well last year</i>.
I remember Mexico. Tell him
I want to see him before he leaves.
Don't get up,
but I've just been called upstairs.
I'm going to go upstairs
to meet the man.
I mean, this could be it. Big doings.
When was the last time you know
anybody who was called upstairs, huh?
I get to ride the express elevator, too!
I have the Prime Minister for you now,
Mr Happer. Hold on.
Mr Happer, ma'am.
(CHUCKLES) Why, yes, I did. I tried it
with the raspberries. It was delicious.
Although I only had frozen.
Yes, ma'am.
Here's Mr Happer now. Goodbye.
(INTERCOM BUZZING)
I'm sorry, Your Excellency,
but Mr Happer can't talk right now.
If you could ask His Serene Highness
to call back in half an hour.
(MAC CLEARS THROAT)
MacIntyre, sir. Pleased to meet you.
-You're going to Scotland, MacIntyre.
-Yes, sir.
Be like going home.
Like we're going home, eh?
The founder of all this was a Scot,
Alexander Knox.
No, that's not him. That's my father.
He bought out Knox in 1912.
Would've been handy if he'd thought
to change the company name
at the same time but...
Well, anyway, you're going to Scotland.
The Old Country, eh, MacIntyre?
(LAUGHS)
Yes, sir.
Virgo is well up this time of the year.
Sir?
I'm talking about the sky, MacIntyre.
The constellation of Virgo
is very prominent in the sky right now
in Scotland.
I want you to keep an eye
on Virgo for me.
Will you do that?
Oh, sure.
(WHIRRING)
This is Virgo.
Find the Great Bear, the Big Dipper
and you can't go wrong. Get to know it.
I'm expecting something special
from there.
Keep your eyes skinned. I want reports.
-Reports, sir?
-Anything unusual in Virgo.
It might be a new star,
or even a shooting star.
I want to know about it. I want reports.
Anything out of the ordinary,
you telephone me, night or day.
This is my private number.
You'll be travelling six hours east
from here. You'll be ahead.
Think of that.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
-I have a general idea.
-You'll know when you see it.
And you telephone me, okay?
You do know what a comet is, don't you?
I feel sure I'd know one if I saw one.
-And you'd phone me?
-I'd phone you, sir.
Good man.
You've got the picture.
The northern sky is a beautiful thing,
MacIntosh.
You're going to have a wonderful trip.
Thank you, sir.
(PHONE RINGING)
Yes?
<i>Hi</i>, <i>Rita</i>.
Who is this?
<i>Mac</i>.
Yes?
<i>I</i>'<i>m gonna be leaving the co</i>u<i>ntry</i>
<i>for a while</i>,<i>j</i>u<i>st a short time</i>
<i>and I was wondering if yo</i>u'<i>d like</i>
<i>to celebrate this evening</i>
<i>with a drink or something?</i>
Uh...
No.
No, it's not, it's Mac. She knows.
No, Mac. M-A-C.
Hello, there.
How are you?
Good. Yeah, I know, I'm terrific, too.
No, I won't keep you, it's just
that I'm leaving town for a while
and you still have some stuff here.
Well, some mail.
Three letters. I'm afraid
they've been here for a while.
What else is just
your cigarette lighter.
The English one.
I thought you might miss that.
No, it's not important
if you can live without it.
There is something else.
Remember my camera case?
The one you kept your make-up in.
I want it back.
No, that's not why I called.
I just thought that...
No, it's not true.
Look, Trudy, I don't want to argue
with you, all right?
Now, look, I'm not calling you a thief.
Look, maybe you are a kleptomaniac.
You think you ought to see a doctor?
You're the pervert.
Look, just piss up a rope, all right?

Excuse me, I'm MacIntyre,
Knox Oil and Gas, Houston.
-Are you...
-Oldsen, yes,
Knox Oil and Gas, Aberdeen.
I didn't want to make a fuss.
I know how delicate this business is.
-Do you have a car?
-Sure.
-And you'll take me to the laboratory?
-Yes.
Well, let's go.
-Can I give you a wee hand?
-Yeah.
Could you close that door? This is
a controlled environment, you know.
Dr Geddes, Mr Watt, this is...
MacIntyre, Houston. Glad to know you.
Welcome to our little world, MacIntyre.
So, you've come to see the bay, eh?
Marina, this is Mr MacIntyre and Mr...
Oldsen.
Danny. Hello.
The sensor on 421 's gone haywire.
I'd better replace it.
NORMAN:
She's got a magnificent pair of lungs.
GEDDES: Oh, yes.
A great asset.
Five degrees in oceanography
and a very talented programmer.
I'll get rid of her when she surfaces.
She's not in on this Ferness thing yet.
Actually, she's better in the field.
Here's the dud.
You can take some lunch now, Marina.
Sure.
I'll show you the site models now,
shall I?
Aye, let you see what
you're in the market for, MacIntyre.
This is a bay in a million.
It's the only one
on the West Coast
where the silt's deep enough
to take the foundation piles.
And this harbour here is a natural
for blasting in the underground tanks.
Here.
Hold Ferness a minute, would you?
Plus, you see, the debris rock
will be used to fill in the other beach
for the refinery.
Of course, with 12 more miles
of coastline to play with
this place could become the
petrochemical capital of the free world.
Six months blasting,
two years construction.
It'll last a thousand years.
Forever.
It'll even survive the next ice age.
We've proved that, you know.
We've proved it.
We've simulated 10,000 years
of intense glaciation
over the whole bay.
Of course, we don't need that ice age.
We can divert the Gulf Stream
and unfreeze the Arctic Circle.
He proved it right here.
But they won't listen.
They want to freeze.
Thank you, Norman,
but there was no need to bring that up.
Will Marina be back?
GEDDES: No, not for a while yet.
We should head north soon.
-We'll see it when we get back, maybe.
-No. Take it.
Keep it.
Dream large.
Dream large.
What are you thinking about?
Girls.
Naked girls.
Me, too.
In a fish tank.
Yeah.
(TYRES SCREECHING)
What's up?
I think we hit something.
It got misty all of a sudden
and I think we hit something.
OLDSEN: Shit, I hate hitting things!
-It's just kind of stunned.
-Maybe a broken leg or something.
Should we put it out of its misery?
What do you mean?
Kill it. Hit it with something hard.
You've already done that
with a two-ton automobile.
Just put it in the car.
Well, we can't drive in this stuff.
Where are we?
The last couple of road signs
were in Gaelic.
It's not one of my languages.
You speak languages?
French, Italian, Spanish, Greek,
Turkish, Russian, Swedish,
German, Japanese, Dutch and Polish.
I have a facility with languages.
I've got some chocolate and some gum.
What have you got?
Nothing, <i>niente</i>,
<i>- nada</i>, <i>rien</i>.
-Okay, okay.
This is my car.
Porsche 930.
Turbo-charged.
A good car's important.
I used to get migraine headaches
when I drove a Chevy.
A car like this won't let you down.
(WATCH ALARM BEEPING)
Conference time in Houston.
I'll give them a call tomorrow.
(SIGHING)
Well, good night.
Yeah.
Do you think
we could have the lights off?
OLDSEN: Sure, sure.
(WATCH ALARM BEEPING)
-Morning.
-Hello.
(OLDSEN COUGHING)
(ENGINE WHIRRING)
Some place, huh?
Yeah.
I think I'll call him Harry.
MAC: No, her name's Trudy.
I'm hungry.
I'll drive.
Whole lot of scenery, though.
(CAR HORN HONKS)
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
MAN: What is it?
Sorry to trouble you so early.
We'd like to check in
and maybe eat something.
Breakfast isn't till eight.
Seven in the fishing season.
It's not the fishing season.
Could we check in anyway?
We've been on the road all night.
We have an injured rabbit also.
(DOOR OPENING)
It's never locked.
Passing through?
We might stay a few days.
Why don't you make yourselves
some toast and coffee
and we'll take care of the formalities
later. I have to go back upstairs.
Thank you.
There's some lettuce in the fridge
for the rabbit.
Nice people, huh?
Yeah. And they speak English.
Do you think they're at it up there?
No.
(MIMICKING MAC)
''We have an injured rabbit also.''
-Think it's them?
-Sure. Hundred percent sure.
Christmas might be early this year.
So, what do you want for Christmas?
Better get that new mattress.
Hang on!
(DOOR OPENING)
Hi. Excuse me,
would you have an adapter?
-I have to charge my briefcase.
-What?
It's an electric briefcase.
The lock is electric.
I have to charge it.
Would you have an adapter?
-Do you need it right away?
-Whenever.
Why don't you leave it with me
and I'll sort something out for you.
I'll just hold on to it.
Okay, fine.
Thanks.
(WOMAN GIGGLING)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
-Everything okay, gents?
-Very nice, thank you.
We only do a hot lunch every other day.
You were lucky.
We have to talk to a Mr Urquhart,
an accountant.
Can you tell me where might we find him?
Indeed, yes. He has an office next door,
to the left, on the first floor.
I know for a fact he'll be there
in about 15 minutes.
Thank you.
Delicious.
Delicious.
(MOTORBIKE APPROACHING)
Come in!
Hello again.
I'm Gordon Urquhart.
We double up on jobs round here.
I'm a taxi driver sometimes, too.
Sit down.
What can I do for you?
I represent Knox Oil and Gas,
Mr ''Og-hart''.
Gordon.
Gordon. Okay, Gordon.
I believe that some of my people
let you know that we would be calling.
(BANGING ON ROOF)
That's right. So, what's up?
We're in the way of acquiring
some real estate in the area and we...
Well, we wanted to ask for your help
in coordinating our work.
What do you want to buy?
(BANGING ON ROOF CONTINUES)
I don't want to be coy with you.
We want to buy the whole place.
We want to buy everything
from the cliffs to the north,
through to the bay on the far side
and we want to go
about a mile inland, too.
That's all.
Well, you're talking about 15,
maybe 20 properties.
You're talking about families,
businesses, farms.
You're talking about a lot of money.
We don't have to go into figures
right now.
I have a breakdown of the properties.
It's a matter of bringing
the community together
and making a collective deal,
if you like.
Why don't you get to know the place?
Take a day or so.
I'll take things as far as I can
and I'll let you know.
How about that?
Okay, Gordon, if you think
it'll take that long.
-You talking about the church, too?
-Yes.
That's gonna be tricky. The church has
very definite views about property.
-We'll leave it in your hands, okay?
-Take in the beach. Relax for a while.
It's a beautiful place.
-And you'll work out some numbers?
-I'll do my best.
Cheerio.
(BANGING ON ROOF)
Take it away, Andrew.
Boy, are we going to be rich.
We're going to sell this hotel.
(HUMMING)
<i># Why do yo</i>u<i>? #</i>
(LAUGHING)
<i># Mr MacIntyre</i>, <i>I know yo</i>u <i>do #</i>
Stella!
Thank you.
-Sorry.
-That's all right.
What do you make of Urquhart, then?
He smells the money.
Nice beach, this, isn't it?
Yeah.
We should come here
when we have to discuss business.
The hotel is too public.
Right.
That's where the jetty will be,
and the storage tanks over here.
All the way up.
It looks just like the model,
doesn't it?
Well, more expensive.
It's some business.
It's the only business.
Could you imagine a world without oil?
No automobiles.
No heat.
OLDSEN: And polish.
MAC: No ink.
OLDSEN: And nylon.
MAC: No detergents.
OLDSEN: And Perspex.
You wouldn't get any Perspex.
MAC: No polythene.
OLDSEN: Dry-cleaning fluid.
MAC: And waterproof coats.
They make dry-cleaning fluid out of oil?
OLDSEN: Yeah. Did you not know that?
(MAC GIGGLING)
MAC: No, I didn't know that.
You know anything about the stars?
Not much.
Why?
I want to check something out.
I'll get a book or something.
(WATCH ALARM BEEPING)
It's business time in Houston.
I want to make some calls.
Can I help you, gentlemen?
Yes. I'd like to use the telephone.
Is there one in the hotel?
There's a phone box across the road
at the jetty.
You'll need some change.
You can talk to anywhere in the world
from there.
Could you change this for me, please?
Tens, the lot.
Well, now,
I don't think we'll manage that.
You got any tens, lads?
The gentleman here would like
to make a very important long-distance
phone call. Intercontinental.
Come on, give me your tens!
Sandy! Got any ten pences? Ten pences.
(MOTORBIKE APPROACHING)
Ricky's on the road tonight.
You've got to look both ways.
Come on.
There you are, Mr Mac.
Full working order.
Thanks. I'm fine now.
Thank you very much.
You don't have to do that.
It's gonna be terrific. Thank you.
-Have you got the code?
-I got the code, yeah.
'Cause if not, I'll get the operator
to sort it for you.
I'll be all right. I'll be okay.
You put the tens in
when you hear the pips.
I'm fine. Thanks.
You've been a big help. I'll see you
later. Later on, I'll see you.
All right.
Bye-bye. Thanks again.
Bye! You've been a big help. Bye.

(DIALLING TONE)
Moritz, you're destroying me.
(LAUGHING)
Yes, now we're getting somewhere.
I think we can move on.
-What do you mean?
-The next stage.
We should physicalise things a little.
-What?
-I could hit you.
Wouldn't that humiliate you?
We'd progress by leaps and bounds.
I could tie you up.
Forget it, Moritz.
You're talking perversion, not therapy.
Go on, get out, and don't come back.
That's good! You're reacting.
You're upset already.
Think what it'll be like
when I punch you!
Get out before I punch you!
This is most gratifying, Mr Happer.
It vindicates my entire theory.
The whole programme.
I've got your ego on the run,
Mr Happer, you piece of shit!
Sorry, sir, that just slipped out.
You'll be hearing from me.
We can't give up now.
You're a star patient, Mr Happer.
I might have to raise my fee
when we do get physical.
But it won't be anything unreasonable.
Good afternoon, Mr Happer.
Mrs Wyatt,
cancel all future appointments
with Moritz and get me Hawaii.
I want Fisher at the observatory.
(COUPLE LAUGHING)
Hello, Danny. Morning, Mr MacIntyre.
We'll give ''Og-hart'' 24 hours.
Yeah.
Look at the birds.
They don't look like seagulls.
No, they're too small for seagulls.
And they're not white.
They'll get wet.
Maybe they're waterproof.
You get waterproof birds?
Yeah, sure you do.
(EXPLOSION)
(EXPLOSION)
Let's check out the church,
talk to the preacher.
I want to do something.
OLDSEN: Do you think Gordon and Stella
do it every night?
MAC: Of course not.
URQUHART: Look, please, everyone,
will you calm down!
Nobody's mentioned money yet.
Don't get excited.
Quiet, please, everyone!
Thanks, Murdo.
All I need just now is
your okay to negotiate.
I've got the Knox man on the hook.
Just give me the time
to land him in style.
Now, he's got a bag full of money.
So stay calm and let me handle him.
I need your patience and your faith.
Trust me.
Would they be wanting
to buy a boat, too, Mr Urquhart?
Gideon, if things go well,
they'll have to buy their own shirts
back off us this time next week.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Now, stay calm.
Trust me.
Gordon, I'd like to say a short prayer
now, since we're all here.
Fine, Murdo.
Quiet, please, everyone!
Murdo wants to say a short prayer.
-Lord...
-It's the Yank and the other one.
They're coming across to the church!
Quiet, please, everyone!
-Murdo, can you deal with them?
-Oh, God.
Just head them off.
Not a sound, please! Oh, God!
This is where the canteen'll be.
What's that?
It's where you have lunch,
you know, and dinner.
A commissary.
-Yeah, that kind of thing.
-Very nice.
Good morning! Can I help you?
-Reverend Macpherson?
-Yes.
My name's MacIntyre. And this is Oldsen.
MacIntyre, eh?
You're not Scottish, are you?
I'm an American, actually.
I'm not a Scotsman, either.
I'm an African.
I came here as a student minister
and didn't ever get away again.
What can I do for you?
We're, um...
We're here on kind of a mission.
Same here.
Well, we're in the way
of wanting to acquire
some real estate in the area, sir,
and we'd like to establish relationships
with those who have land hereabouts.
You want to buy my church?
Well, not as a going concern.
They're practising.
As long as they're bombing the beach,
they can't be bombing anywhere else.
It's kind of comforting.
(LAUGHS)
So far as your business here
is concerned,
all I can recommend is
that you talk to our Mr Urquhart.
He looks after the interests of the
church, in temporal matters, at least.
I understand.
It sounds like good advice, Reverend.
I know I don't have to ask you, sir,
but could you treat our conversation
with confidence, for the meantime?
I give you my word that I'll be as
discreet as the next man, Mr MacIntyre.
Thank you.
But news does tend to travel fast
around here.
I understand, sir.
The reverend says news travels
fast around here.
ALL: Hmm.
Don't know why I'm here.
I'm more of a telex man.
I could sew this whole deal up
in one afternoon over the wires.
That's the kind of person I am.
I need electricity.
(PLANE WHOOSHING)
I don't know about those jets.
They really spoil a very nice area.
It's a crime.
(SIGHING) Yeah.
Excuse me,
can I have another roll, please?
Certainly.
We saw an old man on the beach today.
Who was that?
That'd be Ben.
-Is that his shack?
-Yes.
-And he lives there the whole year?
-Yes.
-Doesn't he get cold?
-No. He's used to it.
-How's the casserole <i>de lapin?</i>
-Excellent. Terrific. Thank you.
<i>Lapin</i>.
That's rabbit.
-Is this my rabbit?
-Yes.
-Harry.
-Trudy.
We don't allow animals in the bedrooms.
I should have told you sooner.
It was a pet, not an animal.
It had a name.
You don't eat things with names.
This is horrific.
It was an injured rabbit, in shock
with a broken limb. It was in pain.
Excuse me, Mr Urquhart,
but I think you were a bit hasty.
Mac was looking after it.
All it needed was lots of rest
and the proper treatment.
There was every chance of
a full recovery and an active life.
Mac was on top of the situation.
They didn't like the rabbit.
Mac loved the rabbit,
that's just the point!
It had a name! Two names!
I'm sorry, I just don't think
there's a lot I can do.
Is it worthwhile
calling the vet, Stella?
Don't be a clown, Gordon.
Get into the kitchen
and make some coffee.
It had a broken leg.
It was a clean snap.
You check the bones in the dish
if you don't believe me.
I'm sorry, Mac, but we eat rabbits here.
The vet would have done the same.
I didn't know it had a name.
It's okay, Stella.
Look, you don't have to finish it
if you don't want to.
How was it, anyway?
It was nice.
Apart from it being Trudy, it was nice.
What lovely long eyelashes you've got.
Was it a wine sauce?
Yeah.
Yeah, I just let it simmer for a couple
of hours in some white wine.
Why did you call it Trudy?
No reason.
Apart from anything else,
a Rolls Royce will last far longer.
It is a false economy
to invest in cheap goods.
It's not cheap. The Maserati's
over 30,000 and it looks much nicer.
I can just see you getting
four or five winter lambs
and a box of mackerel
into the back of a Maserati.
That's what you need your Rolls for.
Its space, there's adaptability.
Are you sure there are two L's
in ''dollar'', Gideon?
Yes.
And are there two Gs in ''bugger off''?
-Andrew, can you knock it off for a bit?
-ANDREW: Okay.
Thanks.
STELLA: Coffee!
Ta!
Stella,
are you busy?
No, just fixing lunch.
Andrew! It's okay,
you can start again now!
(BANGING)
-Don't wave your arm so much.
-I got six!
I got a 10 before.
You didn't see it, but I did.
I think 10 is the maximum
you can get before it sinks.
It's a scientific law.
But it's the size as well.
A middle kind of size seems
to work the best, you know.
I think I'll check out the beach.
Want to come?
No, you go ahead.
I'm going to hang around here
and maybe catch Urquhart later.
Hey, I said it! Urquhart!
Gordon Urquhart.
Gordon Urquhart.
Working hard?
Fixing the creels.
Trying to keep the lobsters in
and the crabs out.
What do you do with the lobsters?
They catch a plane every night
at Inverness.
Oh, aye, the next day
they're being eaten in London or Paris.
Oh, aye, they see the world.
Don't you eat them?
Oh, no. Too expensive.
You work here as well as the bar?
Oh, aye, we all muck in together.
Do any job that's needing done, eh?
Oh, aye.
Have you only got one job?
Yeah, just one.
How's the telephone box?
Is it all right for you?
It's fine, yeah. Fine.
Gideon's going to give it
a fresh coat of paint.
Great.
Any particular colour you'd like?
Red's all right. Red's fine.
Cord could be a little longer though.
In America cords are a bit longer.
(BABY CRYING)
Whose baby?
Come down!
Come here, I want to talk to you!
Baby coral.
You're Mr what's-his-name from Knox.
Danny. We met in Aberdeen.
I remember.
-Did you swim all the way?
-No, I stay here a lot. This is my bay.
I'm working on a biological profile
of the whole area.
-Didn't Geddes tell you?
-Not in so many words.
I'm plotting everything,
from the two headlands right inshore
to the high-tide mark.
How's the water? Cold?
Not as cold as it should be.
The North Atlantic Drift comes in here.
That's warmish water from the Caribbean.
That's why it's special here.
There's stuff fetching up here
from the Bahamas.
That's a long way.
-You swim?
-Not that far.
How are things in the village?
Okay.
They're good people.
Let me know if I can help.
Good afternoon.
Hello. I'd like some toothpaste, please.
Something with fluoride or ammonia.
And some shampoo.
Dry, normal or greasy?
Normal.
Extra-normal.
That's normal.
It'll do your dandruff as well.
They've been smelling the money
ever since you two got here.
They must be going crazy.
-You know why we're here?
-Of course. It's my project, isn't it?
Your project?
The Marine Laboratory, here.
I sent the proposal
to Houston months ago.
You're here to check it out, right?
Don't be coy.
Sure. The Marine Laboratory.
I know it's only a public relations
number for Knox just now.
The future's in here, you know.
Well, actually, I'm not really
a very good swimmer myself, you know.
Hey, listen, when can I see you again?
I'm always around.
I'll pop up and see you again soon.
(STAMMERING) Have you got
enough air left to get you home?
Sure.
Listen, take care, anyway.
See you!
Have you got a telephone number
or anything?
(SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
(STELLA GIGGLING)
-No.
-No?
That's all it is.
No.
A little one over here?
No.
You could paint that out
and put this here.
No.
-No, huh?
-No.
Well, we don't see the point.
Why don't you just ask him
to make us an offer?
It's not that simple.
We can't appear too eager.
We string him along and the price
goes up. Don't you see that?
Aye, but what if he pulls out?
It's too much of a gamble.
We think you should ask him
what he has to offer right now.
-Just a half pint for you, Iain?
-Aye, just a half pint. And a whisky.
I told you I needed your trust
and your patience.
Let me take the strain. Relax.
Give me till the ceilidh, at least.
Twenty-four hours.
Okay, we'll talk at the ceilidh.
Nice to see you in here, Mr MacIntyre.
Mr Urquhart.
I want you to try something.
This is the MacAskill.
A pure malt whisky.
Forty-two years old.
Old enough to be out on his own.
(LAUGHS)
Very true.
<i>-Slainte!</i>
-Yeah.
-I want to talk to you.
-Good.
URQUHART: It's not a matter
of buying off people's feelings.
It's not as crude as that.
It's more a way of taking feelings
into account.
-I agree.
-We're talking massive disturbance,
a way of life changing, resettlement,
lives being restarted.
Sounds like a lot of money,
the way you put it.
One way, it strikes me,
might be a trust fund
over and above a purchase price
a way of letting the community
feel involved in the place.
Say, a lump sum, plus a percentage
of the profits over 10 or 20 years
with some local trustees
and some Knox ones.
I think we have to decide
on a basic price first
and then I'd know how
I could accommodate the frills.
I'll get you a fixed price
averaging over the whole area.
Good.
We have to be talking about millions.
Maybe.
What kind of millions do you reckon
we're talking about?
We'll have to talk about that.
Say, a target figure of maybe...
20 million.
-For the trust?
-For the community, yes.
Pounds.
Dollars, maybe.
-It's a nice evening, though.
-Pretty.
Evening, Ben.
It's a pleasant night, Gordon.
This is MacIntyre.
He's staying with us for a time.
How do you do, Mr MacIntyre?
I would offer you a cup of tea,
but there's only the one other cup.
Hope you don't mind sharing.
Not in the least.
No sugar, though, please.
MacIntyre was asking me how much
I thought the bay was worth, Ben.
That's a good...
That's a good one right enough, Gordon!
Do you know about the stars, Ben?
Well, I know my way around this sky.
What about comets? Any around?
Did you want to buy a comet as well?
Maybe.
If you want to find a comet
all you have to do is look
long enough in the right place.
Where would you look?
If I had the inclination,
I would look in Leo
but it seems like an awful lot
of trouble just to find a comet.
What about Virgo?
You never mentioned comets before,
MacIntyre.
You're opening up a whole new area
of negotiation.
We'll leave you in peace now, Ben.
We're having a ceilidh tomorrow, after
Mac and I have tidied up some work.
-You'll come?
-I'll be there, Gordon.
You can count on me.
Jesus, look.
Holy cow!
Jesus!
Calm down, Mac.
It's just a meteor shower.
(MOTORBIKE APPROACHING)
(BANGING)
Morning, Andrew.
Morning, Mr Mac.
I'll see you later, then.
(PHONE RINGING)
IAIN: Mr MacIntyre!
Telephone! It's a Mr Houston!
MacIntyre, hello.
<i>This is Happer. How are things?</i>
Sir, they're fine.
<i>The deal is abo</i>u<i>t there</i>.
What about the sky?
<i>The sky</i>, <i>sir</i>, <i>is amazing</i>.
There seems to be a lot happening
in it all the time.
Last night there was a meteor shower.
It was spectacular!
Where was the shower, MacIntyre?
It was in the sky. They came down.
-What part of the sky?
<i>-I don</i>'<i>t know exactly</i>, <i>sir</i>
<i>b</i>u<i>t I</i>'<i>m told that comet-wise</i>
<i>Leo might be worth a look</i>.
Should I switch from Virgo? I'll have
more time when we finalise the deal.
No, no. Do both, MacIntyre.
Leo and Virgo.
Have you ever seen a meteor shower, sir?
Oh, once or twice.
It's a sight worth seeing.
I know how you must feel.
<i>Yes</i>, <i>Mr Happer</i>.
I'll keep in touch.
<i>Goodbye</i>, <i>sir</i>.

MARINA: Grey seals.
OLDSEN: They look nice and friendly.
A salmon fisherman would shoot them

They steal his fish and ruin his nets.
And they know what they're doing.
They're rascals.
We're keeping an eye on them, though.
There's only 50,000 left

Aye, they did. They were wrong.

-Hello!
-Hello!
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
How are you all?
(SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN)
-Good to see you, Victor.
-Good to see you, Gordon!
Watch the booze, Gordon.
-Carry these.
-Okay.
Silly bitch.
This is plum brandy for Stella.
The rest is the usual.
How are things?
-I heard about the ceilidh.
-Oh, yeah. We have lots to tell you.
We've been invaded by America.
We're all gonna be rich.
Really?
We won't have anywhere to call home,
but we'll be stinking rich.
-Are there Americans here?
-Just one and a Scots kid.
They're on the beach somewhere.
They take a lot of long walks.
(DISTORTED BEEPING)

(REPEATING JAPANESE)
You taste salty.
You're on the fresh side.
URQUHART: I've got some
insurance policies for you to look at.
How do you make this thing add up?
Mac.
Come and meet Victor Pinochkin.
Victor, this is Mac.
MacIntyre, Knox Oil and Gas, Houston.
Pinochkin, Soviet Fishing Fleet,
Murmansk.
I'm here for the ceilidh.
We have been buying some fish
in the Minch.
You are doing some business too,
I believe?
Yes. I think I'll go upstairs
and wash out these shells.
Hey, hey, hey! What have you got there?
Is that a scallop shell?
A very nice one.
This is a razor fish or razor clam.
They call them spoots around here.
You can eat them.
Catching them is a problem though.
They jet through the sand.
Strong little things.
I wouldn't want to eat them.
Why don't you come down
for a drink later, Mac?
-Yeah. I'll see you later.
-See you.
URQUHART: I've left all of last year's
money on short-term deposit.
It wasn't worthwhile
moving it into stock.
I didn't know when you might need it.
Wouldn't it work harder
on the money market?
The amounts don't justify it, Victor.
Besides, the dollar is
all over the place just now.
It'd be a full-time job
just monitoring it.
Maybe I'm getting lazy.
No, I see what you mean.
You should think again
about some property.
I'll be pretty liquid
once this Knox thing goes through.
You could come in with me.
You know I am a cash man, Gordon.
I'll have to think about it.
Hey, that's a ribbed mussel. Nice.
Yeah. And this is a scallop.
A bay scallop, I would say, actually.
Yeah, yeah, and this is a razor shell.
So how's business, then?
Do you need any help?
No. Urquhart's got
all the powers of attorney.
We should have a draught agreement
by tonight.
So we've swung it, then?
It looks like it.
No opposition at all?
They'll do all right.
We're not robbing anybody.
Do they know
what's gonna happen to the place?
They're going to be rich,
that's all they know.
Do you think I could borrow
your ribbed mussel, please?
I want to show it to someone.
-Bring it back?
-First thing tomorrow.
Okay.
-Thank you.
-Bye.
Hey!
Yeah?
Do you speak Russian?
Yeah, that's one of mine.
You want my scallop, too?
No, thanks. The mussel will do.
Okay. See you at the ceilidh, then.
Bye.
(BAND PLAYING SCOTTISH MUSIC)
-Please, come on!
-No, no. Thanks very much.
Do you not want to dance with me?
It's not that.
It's just that I've got a drink over...
Come on. Just enjoy yourself.
(ALL WHOOPING)
(BAND PLAYING FAST-PACED MUSIC)
If we call the useless land,
the beach and the cliffs,
a third of the price of the working land
and the village
we get the average price
of 2,000 per acre.
-That's your work.
-Sounds fine.
Then I'm asking for a tiny, tiny
five percent of revenue over 10 years
on top of the 10 million at the start.
I can't say on the percentage.
But you can have the 10 million
plus some form of participation
to be mutually...etcetera, etcetera.

(SCOTTISH ACCENT)
Give me a 42-year-old whisky, Roddy!
We've none of that tonight, Mr Mac.
Well, give me four eight-year-olds
and a 10-year-old.
All right, that adds up!
<i># Yeah</i>
<i># Even the lone stars they get lonesome</i>
<i># Lonesome for a lone star man like me</i>
<i># Lonesome for a lone star man</i>

(ALL CHEERING)
Four generations of working that farm.
Digging and draining and planting.
Years and years and it comes to this.
Aye, strange times, Archie.
What was it Gordon Urquhart offered you?
One-and-a-half million in cash
plus two percent of the relocation fund
and a share in the oil field revenue.
Aye, strange times, strange times.
(BAND PLAYING FAST MUSIC)
(WOMAN WHOOPING)
-Come on, Mac, what do you say?
-What do I say what?
Let's haggle.
Haggle?
Dollars or pounds?
The 2,000 per or the 10 million?
Pounds. Let's say pounds.
Come on, Mac, negotiate!
Call it whatever you want, Gordon.
Pounds, yen, rubles.
You name it.
It was only <i>£</i>40 at Christmas.
But you were only charging two
at the door at Christmas.
Inflation's going up all the time,
you know.
It's your spiralling costs
you're talking about.
Anyway, Alan's got a new guitar now.
We're a fiver short, Murdo.
-Sorry, Gordon.
-Thanks.
You'll still give us a hand

Oh, aye.

We're waltzing.

Well, that would be James Stewart.
That's Cary Grant.

Humphrey Bogart.
No, that was James Stewart.

What's so special about him?
He's different.

You're bloody right he's different!
Cheer up.
You've made everybody very happy.
You are a success. Cheers.
It's their place, Mac.
They have a right to make
what they can of it.
You can't eat scenery.
Cheers!
Yeah.
You speak a lot of sense for an oil man.
(FLUTE PLAYING SOFTLY)
Is everyone celebrating?
Almost everyone.
Well, when do I get the good news?
Look, I want to talk to you about that.
There is a kind of alternative plan
for the place.
Geddes at the lab is in on it.
He's got all the details.
What do you mean?
It's a kind of oil thing
or terminal or something.
No.
I don't see that happening here.
I don't see that at all.
Holy mackerel! What's happening?
That's just the northern lights,
aurora borealis.
High-energy protons spilling over
into our atmosphere.
They get through the magnetic shield
where it's weak, at the poles.
It's still beautiful.
I don't care what you call it.
How often does this happen?
Any old time.
Although it's best
when the sun's active.
That gets the solar wind up
and that's where the protons come from.
You say the darnedest things, Marina.
I don't feel sick,
I just feel a wee bit dizzy.
I'll put a bit of colour
into your cheeks, darling!
What's happening up there?
That's the northern lights, Mac.
-What the heck is that?
-It's pretty technical.
Nice, though, isn't it?
Hey, everybody, I need tens!
Gotta have tens.
I need tens.

I'm watching the sky, sir!
It's doing some amazing things.
It's got everything. Reds, greens,
a kind of shimmering.
And there's a noise, too,
like a far-off thunder,
only it's softer.
I wish you could see it.
I wish I could describe it to you
just like I'm seeing it.
Be more specific, MacIntyre.
You're my eyes and ears there.

It's white and green and red.
I'm sorry, that's the phone box.
Oh, it's blue! It's just blue.

Oh, Gordon...

Well, Edward,
I wonder what the poor people

Aye. But Peter,
I thought all this money
would make me feel...
different.
What do you mean?
Well, all it's done is make me
feel depressed.
I don't feel any different.
Well, Edward,
you'll just need to buck up.
You need to accept the fact
you're stinking rich.
Nobody ever said that it was going
to be easy to be a millionaire, Ed.
I have a proposition for you, Gordon.
I know I may be a bit tipsy
but I want you
to consider this seriously, okay?
-Okay.
-Okay.
I want to swap with you.
Everything.
I want to stay here.
Run the hotel,
do little bits of business.
You can go to Houston,
take the Porsche, the house, the job.
It's a good life there, Gordon.
I pull down 80,000 a year.
Plus I have over 50,000
in mixed securities.
I want you to have it all.
(BEER SPLATTERING)
There's nothing due on the car,
it's pure ownership.
And I won't let down
your good name here, Gordon.
I'll make a good Gordon, Gordon.
What do you say, pal?
What about Stella?
I was coming to that.
I love her.
Very, very much.
She's wonderful.
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever loved
and I think she knows it.
I want you to leave Stella here
with me, Gordon.
Would you do that?
Would you leave Stella here with me?
Sure, Mac.
You're a good guy, Gordon.
MAC: Do you drive a car, Victor?
VICTOR: Yes.
I share a Volvo 144 Estate

I drive a Porsche 930.
What's the insurance like on a Porsche?
Very heavy.
But I get a deal through Knox Insurance.
You got hi-fi?
Quad and video.
I've got quad outfit, too.
Picked it up in Japan.
Here's my address in Houston, Victor.
If you ever get to the States,
give me a call.
Thank you very much.
Let me give you my address
in Murmansk, too, Mac.
I'm not there a lot but...
you never know.
Here's my card.
How come you're here?
Fishing.
I have been coming here for years.
(EXPLOSION)
I like it here
but it is tough life for the locals.
You should be proud of yourself,
making them millionaires.
I don't know.
(PLANE WHOOSHING)
(EXPLOSION)
-Breakfast ready, Gordon?
-We've a problem.
-What?
-The beach. Ben's beach.
What's the problem?
The problem is,
it really is Ben's beach.
(PHONE RINGING)
He owns the shoreline, four miles of it,
from the grass down
to the low-tide mark.
I found it in the parish records
when I was checking out title deeds.
Can he prove it?
We can't steal the beach
from him, Victor. It's his.
You'll have to buy it from him.
It's not in my budget.
I thought the shore properties
covered the beach.
I didn't make allowances for this.
Work out a price, Gordon,
juggle the figures,
steal something from the trust fund.
Something.
Does he know he owns it?
I thought we could just relocate him,
but this is different.
Can't you stick in some more money, Mac?
It's a new property, after all.
Mr Mac.
That was a telephone call from America.
There's a Mr Happer coming
to see you here.
-Happer?
-Yes. H-A-P-P...
P-E-R.
-They spelt it for me.
-Oh, Jesus!
One million sterling, Gordon,
and not a penny more.
Then you're on your own.
That includes the cliffs and the rocks.
Small rocks as well.
Okay, Mac, I've got the message.
Where's the door here?
There is no door.
Just bang on the window.
Jesus! How do you do business
with someone who doesn't have a door?
The ethics are just the same.
Ben, could I have a word with you?
Ben, hello.
We wanted to talk to you.
You know MacIntyre.
Hi, Mr MacIntyre.
This is Victor Pinochkin.
This is Ben Knox.
-How do you do, Mr Victor?
-How do you do?
Your name is Knox?
My name's Knox, yes.
Can we come in, or will you come out?
I'll tell you what.
I'll just get the fire started.
This is your beach, isn't it, Ben?
Oh, yes.
It's been in the family for, what,
400 years.
Aye, the Lord of the Isles gave it
to an ancestor of mine.
He helped him out
with a spot of trouble.
Killed his brother for him,
something like that.
You have a deed or anything? Papers?
It's in the museum in Edinburgh.
It's a historical document.
Mac.
Sure, sure. Ben,
what we wanted to ask you...
Have you ever thought about moving?
No.
-No?
-No.
MacIntyre represents some people
who think they have a use for the beach.
They want to pay you for using it.
Money?
A lot of money.
<i>£</i>100,000 pounds.
You see, the thing is, I'm still working
the place myself.
It's my living.
It supports me.
You'd have lots of money.
You wouldn't have to work.
We all have to work, Gordon.
I mean, the beach has to be worked.
Think of the state
the place would get into.
(CHEERFUL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Gordon, can this music be turned off?
Oh, yeah.
-Don't you like this?
-No.
-You mean you never liked it?
-No.
Even when you first came here,
you didn't like this?
No.
Oh.
Half a million pounds
is a lot of money, Ben.
Even enough to buy another beach with.
Look, I've got some postcards.
I've got some very fine beaches here.
I want to make you an offer.
How about this?
Any beach that takes your fancy,
anywhere in the world, I'll get for you.
Look at this, Hawaii.
I can get you five
or six miles of Hawaii, no problem.
Or, look here, Australia.
Look at that sand.
Yes, I mean, they look like
very nice beaches, Mr MacIntyre, but...
see, I only need the one.
I have this here.
I don't need another one.
Besides, I'm not sure that there's
a living in any of these beaches.
You've got to go into that kind
of thing in detail.
I'll buy you any beach you want
and I'll give you <i>£</i>750,000
to set yourself up with.
It'll give you some security
in the early stages. What do you say?
You're great at talking
the big numbers, Mr MacIntyre.
-Say, look, you're good at numbers, eh?
-It's part of my job, yes.
Would you give me a pound note for
every grain of sand I hold in my hand?
Now, you can have the beach for that.
Saved you a pound or two, eh?
Come on, I don't want to play games.
Let's negotiate in a businesslike way.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, I mean...
(SCOFFS) You could have had a very nice
purchase there, Mr MacIntyre.
I can't hold much more
than 10,000 grains
of sand in my hand at a time.
Did you think it would be
a bigger number?
You took advantage of me, Ben.
Did I?
How about a hatful of sand?
Ah, no, no.
I mean, that wouldn't be businesslike.
(BEN GIGGLES)
(BEN SIGHS)
Danny, get the wine glasses
without the stems, will you?
Sure. Now, would anybody like
some more potatoes?
-No, thank you.
-No.
Yes, please.
-Some roast, if you have them.
-Sure thing, Mr Knox.
And a couple more sprouts.
Anything.
Is he going to sell?
He wants some more sprouts.
Here, let's have a look.
Want to buy a house, Andrew?
I'm trying to sell one, Edward.
-Good night, Ben.
-Gordon, good night.
-I've enjoyed myself.
-Good.
Mr...
Good night.
URQUHART:
Can we have a word with you, Ben?
Let's walk him home.
What if I told you that 400, 500 people
could make a living right here
if things were allowed to change?
It wouldn't be the first time, would it?
-What do you mean?
-Local history, Gordon.
This beach used to be a good living
for 300 people.
They gathered the seaweed and extracted
the chemicals. Big business.
Two hundred years ago,
this beach was turning over
<i>£</i>15,000 a year.
Then the trade routes opened up again
to the east and so, ''Farewell, Ferness.''
The business went, but
the beach is still here.
If you got the place, it would be
goodbye beach forever, wouldn't it?
Have an orange, Gordon.
I found a box on Tuesday on the rocks.
Thanks.
I found a coconut once.
God knows where that came from.
What's the most amazing thing
you ever found?
Impossible to say.
See, there's something amazing
every two or three weeks.
I'll let you know the next time.
Good night.
Shit, this is South African.
-Maybe we ought to stick around, huh?
-No, he'll be all right.
Uh-oh.
They've taken the church road.
Maybe they just want to talk to him.
-You think that's all they'll do?
-Sure. They just want to talk to him.
-There's an awful lot of them.
-Yeah.
I'm travelling light, MacIntyre.
One bag in the luggage compartment.
Say, you didn't need
to put on this reception.
This is just an informal visit.
But now that I'm here,
I think I'd like to organise
a presentation.
Something these people might need.
A church hall, a piano, or anything.
I'd like to make it a personal gift.
You're can let me know
about it tomorrow, hmm?
How about the sky, MacIntyre?
Anything new?
Well, we'll talk about it later.
Thanks for the call.
(STUTTERING) I'm not MacIntyre, sir.
Well, where the hell is he?
I've been on the move for 24 hours.
I'm not playing games.
Are you MacIntyre?
Yes, sir.
-Get me a room.
-Yes, sir.
This is Gordon Urquhart, hotel...
Hotel. This way, sir.
Get the luggage, Danny.
(MAC SIGHING)
Good sky you've got here, MacIntyre.
Well done.
One or two unfamiliar objects
to look at up there.
I like this place.
The air is good, clear.
Get me a telescope. Tomorrow.
Two-inch refractor will do.
Hear that? I want a two-inch refractor
for tomorrow.
Ben's got a telescope.
It's bigger than two inches, though.
About this wide, this long.
Jesus! Ben's got this whole place
sewn up.
Come on, Danny, carry that stuff.
I'll offer him the piano,
if he's the problem.
We've tried most things, sir.
Did you try a piano?
No, we offered him
a million and a half dollars.
I don't know if he plays the piano.
And he owns the whole beach, hmm?
Yes, sir. It's been in the Knox family
for 400 years.
(MAC CLEARS THROAT)
Knox?
Ben Knox. I'm sorry, sir. It's his name.
Perhaps I'd better talk to him.
What's he like?
He's kind of eccentric, roams the beach,
has an interest in the stars, too.
In fact, he has a telescope.
About this big.
He knows the sky
like the back of his hands.
I'll talk to him.
He has this trick
he does with sand, sir.
So if he offers you
anything to do with sand,
say yes and we'll get him
to sign something right away.
Did you say sand?
Yes, sir. Anything up
to half a bucketful, say yes.
He wants to sell me the sand?
No, sir.
You'll get the drift if he does it.
Well, don't worry about it, MacIntyre.
I've got a plan.
I'm going to offer him a telescope.
A great big one!
Yeah. Well, good luck, sir.
Ben, it's Mac again.
Good morning to you, Mr Mac.
Ben, this is Mr Happer.
He'd like to talk with you.
Delighted to meet you, sir.
Mr Happer is from America, like me.
-America, eh?
-Mm-hm.
Well, then, Mr...
-Happer, Happer.
-Happer, Happer, is it?
You'd better come in,
if you've come that far.
Well, thank you, sir.
Oh.
That'll be all for now, MacIntyre.
Yes, sir.
See if they're still laughing.
What happened?
Well, they want some whisky
and Ben wants some beef sandwiches
with mustard and no salt.
Did Happer say anything?
He doesn't want any mustard at all.
He just wants the salt.
Nothing else happened?
I asked them if they wanted water
for the whisky...
Okay. Okay.
Stay cool, Mac. It's a good sign.
I'll get the food.
Bring some brandy back with you, Gordon.
I'm dying.
(BEN AND HAPPER LAUGHING)
(BABY CRYING)
Well,
<i>slainte</i>, everybody.
-What?
-What?
<i>Slainte?</i>
<i>Na zdorovje!</i>
<i>-Skol</i>.
-ALL: Cheers.
(BEN AND HAPPER LAUGHING)
Jesus, what's going on in there?
Sounds like they are buddies.
Any news about the money, Gordon?
Not yet, Edward.
Here, have another brandy.
EDWARD: Thanks.
OLDSEN: Hey, look!
-See you tonight.
-Tonight.
Hello, MacIntyre.
How did it go, sir?
Fine, fine.
This place has a lot to offer.
But I think the refinery site
was a mistake.
Ben's been filling me in.
Ben has eight unplotted objects
in this very sky right above us.
Think of that.
We're doing a scan tonight.
The acquisition is
at a pretty advanced stage, sir.
Oh, I want this place, MacIntyre.
Make no mistake about that.
But tell Crabbe to start rethinking
the refinery site
when you see him, tomorrow.
I see a kind of...
a kind of an institute here,
a place for research, and for study.
An observatory, so to speak,
with radio and optical telescopes.
And after a while, we can branch out.
The sea, sir!
This is a natural place
for a marine laboratory.
We've already prepared some data
at the Aberdeen Lab.
The North Atlantic Drift,
it comes right in here
and fetches up all sorts of interesting
things from all over the world.
Sea and sky. Hmm...
I like that, I like that.
We can do good things here.
You could call it
the Happer Institute, sir.
You might be right.
It might be just the name for it.
It says it all. Good thinking.
Good thinking...
Oldsen, sir.
Oldsen, we've got a job to do.
You stay here with me.
MacIntyre, Crabbe is gonna need you
right away.
Take the chopper, go to Aberdeen
and get on over to Houston.
Tell Crabbe to start thinking
along the lines of...
Well, of an offshore establishment,
but just for storage.
And tell him to put the refinery
nearer the models.
Tonight, sir?
The sooner the better.
And MacIntyre, get yourself a shave.
What's this laboratory thing, Danny?
You didn't tell me about that.
It's something I've been
piecing together recently.
Some of Geddes's people are in on it.
You remember the girl?
Oh, yeah, the girl.
MacIntyre, you'd better get moving.
I'm glad I got here in time
to stop your refinery caper.
Oldsen,
get my overcoat
and prepare some food for later.
Ben and I will be full-time
on the telescope tonight.
Yes, Mr Happer.
Oldsen, I could grow to love this place.
You don't really have to pay, Mac.
I could stick it on the Knox tab.
Anyway, it's been fun having you.
-No, I'll pay. I want to.
-Okay.
And make it out to Stella B Urquhart.
-Stella?
-She's the boss.
This is an American bank account,
Gordon. It might not be valid here.
Don't worry, we'll stick it
on the wall for a souvenir.
I hope things work out with Happer.
We can handle him.
It's always the same.
The big boys want the playground
all to themselves.
At least there'll be work
around the place, and money.
Yeah. Work and money.
It'll be okay.
(SIGHING) Well, so long.
You should say goodbye to Stella.
She's upstairs.
No, it doesn't matter.
Go and see her, Mac.
You say toodle-oo for me, Gordon.
And toodle-oo to you too.
I'll see you off.
Marina!
Marina?
Marina!
It's the plans!
The lab, it's going to happen!
I told them all about it!
The marine laboratory,
it's going to happen!
Hey, Mr Mac!
Hey! Can I...
Can I get your autograph, please?
(HELICOPTER ENGINE REVVING)
Ta! Good luck!
Hold on, Marina! I want to talk to you!
ALL: Goodbye!
Is that the Yank in that thing, Edward?
Aye, Peter, that's him away.
Bugger it! I meant to say cheerio.
