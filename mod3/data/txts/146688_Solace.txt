- Cuban.
- What's the word, Sawyer?
Looks like a match.
Yeah, it's Joe.
We've got a series.
Same M.O.,
same signature, no DNA.
Not one goddamn shred.
You said that already.
I'm doing everything I can.
Goddamn fucking asshole.
Fuck.
I need to go see him.
Joe.
I think it's a mistake.
You're entitled to your own opinion.
Well, let me rephrase that.
I think it's a big mistake.
Apart from time and resources,
it's bringing an unknown into a...
- into a really bad situation.
- Not unknown at all.
I've worked with him before, and I
actually considered him to be my friend.
You said he's unstable.
That's not what I said, Katherine.
I said he's had a hard time.
It's too early
for a Hail Mary, Joe.
You will learn it's never
too early for one of those.
Goddamn, are you seeing this?
I mean, look at all this...
pretty green shit.
How long has
he lived out here?
Two years.
Ever since his daughter Emma died.
Leukemia.
In his arms.
Gave up his medical practice.
Hell, he gave up everything.
What happened to his wife?
Well, therein lies
the truth about tragedies.
They bring some people
closer together and...
...drives others apart.
There it is.
Do you mind staying here?
Let me talk to him alone?
- You could have left me in the city.
- I could've...
But then you would have missed
all the pretty green shit.
Sentiment.
Yeah?
- John? It's Joe.
- Yeah, I know.
You gonna open the door?
There's something I'd like
to talk to you about.
Not interested.
John, I just drove 3 hours
to come and see you.
Come on. You know me well enough
to know that I'm not leaving.
And I'll kick down this door
if I have to.
A real pain in the ass,
you know that?
Yeah.
I've heard that before.
You know, I sent you a letter
like a year ago. Did you get it?
Yep.
What did it say, John?
"No parent should
outlive a child."
- So, this is where you've been holed up.
- Uh-huh.
I see you've settled in.
You know. It's a
beautiful day out there.
Yeah.
That's what they tell me.
So, you don't get out much?
- Do you want a soda?
- No, thank you, I'm good.
- Don't have cigarettes.
- It's alright.
I actually gave them up
a few months ago.
Meet my new addiction.
Laura and the kid okay?
Yeah, they're good.
Thank you.
Elizabeth.
You heard from her yet?
No.
You will.
So, besides wanting
to see you...
I've got a situation that
I'd like you to take a look at.
Uh-uh.
Maybe I could just tell
you about the victims.
I told you, I'm not interested.
By the way,
who's your girlfriend?
That is my loyal partner,
Agent Cowles,
who apparently doesn't listen
to a fucking word I say.
S.A.C., Joe.
I thought you might
want to take the call.
Excuse me, John.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I brought the case files.
- It wasn't necessary.
The Agency changed the guidelines
for the way we break down
the cases.
It makes them more readable.
Oh.
Well, that's a relief.
We gotta go.
Three murders.
Identical M.O.
Agent Cowles.
I'll leave the case files here.
John.
You okay?
If you change your mind
about this...
...you know where to find me.
WHO AM I?
- Hi, Joe.
- John.
Make no promises.
I'll stay maybe one day.
Maybe one week.
Deal.
No promises.
You knew I'd come back, huh?
Well.
I had high hopes.
- You remember Agent Cowles?
- Yup.
Or, perhaps I should say "Dr. Cowles",
with a doctorate in...?
Psychopathology, Columbia.
She was on her way to becoming
a professor in NYU
before the bureau snagged her.
You gave up academia
for this madhouse?
Oh.
They let me carry a gun.
Wow!
So sexy.
You two are going to
make a helluva team.
John, you know when someone's
about to do something and
Katherine, you know why
they're about to do something.
- Run this through, just keep it
down here for us when we come out.
- You bet.
Dr. Clancy, before we go upstairs,
with all due respect,
I don't hold an ounce of confidence in
the paranormal as a field, as a whole.
I think it's a sham.
I hope that won't be a problem.
No, no problem at all.
I feel the same about shrinks.
After only one thing,
your money.
Give them you little finger.
They'll take your whole hand.
Whoever said that has obviously
never met a good one.
It was Sigmund Freud.
Like I said, a hell of a team.
Consistency #1: Method.
Each victim was killed by a puncture
wound at the base of the skull.
Inflicted by a five-inch instrument.
It went straight into
the medulla oblongata.
Immediate, according to the coroner.
Painless execution.
These photos are all post-mortem.
A couple of them, they almost
look alive, don't they?
Consistency #2:
No mistakes.
Crime scenes so far have yielded
no evidence of DNA, hair-fibers,
- shoe-prints, nothing.
- No witnesses, either.
Ward lived in a secured
building with a doorman.
So, no signs of forced entry.
On the psych front, it's unheard of.
There's no geographical,
chronological
or astrological pattern
to the murder.
No robbery.
Other than that, I think
we got a good handle on this case.
John?
John.
Yeah.
Robert Ellis,
the kid in Mount Pleasant.
- He was eating ice cream.
- He was.
Where'd you want to start,
John?
Well...
What about at the beginning?
The residence of
Mrs. Ethel Jackson, age 69.
She lived alone with three cats.
Was a regular at church.
Landlady grew suspicious when she
hadn't seen or talked to her in two days.
She was found killed
in that rocking chair.
On the TV,
the Cooking Channel played.
And the note
we were looking at earlier?
Was here.
On this table.
WHO AM I? I WILL TELL YOU
IN TWO WORDS WHO I AM,
WHAT I DO, AND HOW I LIVE. MAY I?
It's my wife. I'm sorry,
I need to take this.
Sweetheart, hold on...
- What do you make of the note?
- A shrink's perspective?
- Yeah.
- It's a classic riddle.
"I will tell you in two words who I am,
what I do, and how I live. May I?"
Taunting questions
designed to mislead.
Asking our permission to reveal himself,
yet never intending to.
It's playful, but only one person
is playing here. It's solitaire.
Or is it something more?
Is it a cry for help?
Is it, an indication of
split personality disorder,
where the riddler is
asking themselves, and us,
who they actually are? But no.
That's not consistent with the crime.
This is too controlled,
too sharp.
There's something else
going on here.
It's like he's looking for someone.
- So?
- She likes hats.
Hey.
How are we doing?
Fantastic.
Katherine is working up a full
psych profile based on the note.
Which she's going to
go home now and finish.
Okay.
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yes.
John.
How about I buy you dinner?
Special treat. Best place in town.
Do I need a jacket?
Hell, no, you don't. I got connections.
I know the maître d'.
Goddamn it.
This is so good!
- John?
- No, none for me.
For John, one more please. Yeah?
Yes, sir.
Coming up.
My boy's having a rough time in school.
Came home in tears again today.
- Being bullied?
- Yeah.
I don't know what to do.
I know. Just give him a hug.
Tell him a joke, a pat in the back.
- A joke?
- Yeah. A joke.
I don't know any jokes.
I'm serious, John. Come on.
In the name of friendship,
tell me a joke.
Me?
I don't know any jokes.
Okay, just one.
Um...
This woman, Mrs. Jones, uh,
She's suffering from
a rare heart condition.
The doctor prescribes male hormones
to up her testosterone, 2 pills a day.
She takes them and a month later
she goes back to the doctor and says...
"Doctor. That hormone medicine
is doing wonders for my heart.
The only problem is
I'm growing hair
in places I've never
grown hair before."
He says, "Don't worry about it, Mrs. Jones,
excessive hair is to be expected.
Where exactly is this hair growing?"
She says, "On my balls, Doctor.
On my balls."
It's funny, isn't it?
John, I can't tell that
to my little boy.
- Say "testicles."
- Yeah. That cleans it right up.
Biology.
- It's a good joke, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I thought you'd like that.
I remember Elizabeth telling me
that's why she fell in love with you.
- Why was that?
- That smile.
Oh, the smile.
'Cos, I don't think it
was your joke telling.
So, John, do I have another
sandwich coming here or what?
Coming up.
Tonight, as we were
leaving Ethel Jackson's,
- you were onto something.
- Hmm.
Come on, John. Talk to me.
What do you know?
Look. I want this over as quickly
and as badly as you do,
but you gotta tell me
what you're seeing.
I don't know yet.
John...
What's "ATTICUS", John?
We received an anonymous call
from a pay-phone
an hour ago offering way too specific
information about the Peter Ward murder.
And listed a midtown address.
PD has secured the perimeter.
Waiting for us to go in.
Clear!
Clear!
[ 4:16 ]
Joe.
Take a look at this.
What do you think?
4:16.
Bible verse?
No, it's the time.
Four minutes ago.
Four-sixteen precisely.
Your watch is fast.
Fuck.
He's here.
- You good?
- Good. Go.
Mrs. Raymond?
FBI.
Would someone please
turn that shit off?
- Bingo.
- Wound on the back of the neck.
Familiar.
She's been dead a while,
5, 6 hours.
Perp must have hung
around to leave that note.
He left hours ago.
You two mind,
clear the room for us please?
Thank you.
John.
[ I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH. ]
Same type font as 4:16
and the note at Ethel Jackson's.
Mm-hmm.
- You okay?
- Shit.
- Go ahead. Take a look.
- Can I touch her?
Yeah.
David.
David?
There you are.
Come in.
Wash my back.
John?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- What do you see?
- I'm not sure.
- Okay.
- What?
- Don't touch the bathwater.
- Why?
Just don't touch it.
I'm not sure why.
Joe. Holy shit,
we may have a suspect.
- Who?
- David Raymond.
The husband.
He says
he was at the bar all night.
His bartender and his breath
corroborate his story.
- Agent Cowles, are you ready?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to take the lead.
Mr. Raymond, a cup of coffee.
- Been a long night for all of us.
- Thank you.
If you don't mind...
...I'm just gonna jump
right into this. Okay?
- Mr. Raymond.
- Yeah?
We regret to inform you
that your wife, Victoria,
died last night.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, God. Oh, God...
Mr. Raymond...
...you were seen leaving
your apartment building
last night in an agitated state.
Can you tell us why?
Did she leave a note?
Did she leave a note?
Mr. Raymond,
your wife was murdered.
- What?
- Your wife was murdered.
- She didn't leave a note.
- She...
No! No!
Oh, Jesus, God!
- David, what do you think happened?
- She didn't commit suicide?
Why do you think
she committed suicide?
The letter, I wrote... I...
I wrote a letter.
- This letter?
- No. What is that?
You didn't write this?
I left a letter.
What did it say?
David?
"I never meant to hurt
or betray you."
David.
David?
What did the letter say?
He left her.
I was leaving her.
Okay.
You were leaving her.
Why?
He left her for someone else.
I was leaving her
for someone else.
For another woman?
Yes.
He's lying.
Oh, V, I'm so sorry.
Oh, god, Victoria.
Uh, could I have a word with
Mr. Raymond?
- Dr. Clancy...
- Joe?
- All right.
- Thanks.
You're telling the truth,
or at least some of it.
You didn't kill your wife
did you, Mr. Raymond?
No.
But you believe the note you left
could've driven her to take her own life.
Your wife had a history of
emotional instability.
And the note was telling her that you
were leaving her for someone else.
But your note failed to mention
you were leaving her for a man.
How the fuck do you know that?
That, in fact,
you had contracted HIV.
Is that right?
Her blood was contaminated.
That's why:
"Careful with the bathwater."
I want to see the files again.
It's 7:30 in the morning.
My family's up. Feel like breakfast?
- Yeah.
- Let's go.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Laura.
- You need to eat.
- I'm good, baby. Thank you.
- Family is looking good, Joe.
- Yeah. They are, aren't they?
I've been trying to spend as much time
as I can to be with them.
We've seen Elizabeth.
- Oh, yeah?
- Laura.
We've kept in touch.
- Good.
- She still loves you, John.
All right. So, uh...
What do you think?
Well. They were all
incurably sick, terminally ill.
- That is the consistency.
- We explored that. It doesn't hold up.
Ethel Jackson.
The wigs, the hats and all that.
- She was under going chemotherapy.
- That's right. Three years ago.
She was in complete remission.
She was in the clear, John.
No.
No one's ever in the clear.
80 % of cancers return.
And whenever they do...
they're quite difficult to eliminate.
So?
So... Peter Ward, it turns out, had the
first signs of Lou Gehrig's Disease.
That can be a very slow,
rather painful death.
And Victoria Raymond, she suffered
chronic suicidal depression,
self-destructive behavior, cutting,
overdose, that kind of thing.
- You finished your breakfast, Kevin?
- Yes, Mom!
Hey hey hey.
Backpack!
Yes.
Come here, say goodbye to John.
- Bye-bye, John.
- Goodbye, monkey.
Give your dad a hug.
- Bye, Dad. See you after school.
- Yeah, man. Have a good day.
Okay.
- Have a good day at work.
- Bye, honey.
Okay. Let's say I give you
Ethel Jackson and Peter Ward.
Two words that destroy
this whole theory:
Robert Ellis, the boy in Mount Pleasant.
And not only was he healthy,
his parents were Christian Scientists,
they don't believe in medicine,
so, the boy didn't have
a medical file.
- Well, let's go talk to them.
- Okay.
You have an appointment, remember?
Right, I do. I have a phone call
with the director at 9:00 am,
which I am immensely
looking forward to.
So, I will call Katherine
and have her take you.
Okay.
Dr. Clancy...
How do you refer to it?
To what?
To, uh, what you have?
Is it prescience,
clairvoyance, precognition?
Oh, it's a hoot.
A laugh a minute.
I'm... I'm serious.
What is it you see exactly?
Do you see people's futures?
Oh, sometimes I see both.
Bits and pieces of their futures.
Bits and pieces of their pasts.
It's all the same in the end.
- Is it mystical or religious in any way?
- No. No. I'm a scientist.
I believe in
theoretical physics and...
biochemistry and that's it.
Whatever it is, I happen to get
this super duper deluxe edition
of what people now call
intuition or gut reaction.
Do you see anything now?
What do you mean?
About you?
I guess so.
No.
Nothing.
- At all?
- At all.
Just nothing.
Nothing at all.
So, how...
how is the investigation going?
It's improving.
We believe we know why
your son was killed. Why he was chosen.
Mr. Ellis, I need to ask you a few
questions but I don't want to upset you.
It's all right. Ask.
If I can, I'd like to help.
Do you remember in the weeks
or months leading up to Robert's death,
was he at his best?
Was he healthy?
- Perfectly.
- He never complained of any pain?
Did he ever have trouble keeping up
with other boys at school?
Was he ever short of breath or...?
Uh...
No. No.
- Be careful.
- I will.
Robert was a sculptor?
Yeah.
He enjoys it.
He enjoyed it.
He had very good hands.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ellis.
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.
What happened to this one?
He knocked it over
maybe a day or two before...
How did he knock it over?
I don't remember.
Kids are clumsy.
Robert especially?
Well...
Sometimes.
He'd upset his glass at dinner...
- You're talking to them?
- They just got here.
Did you catch him?
No.
- Then what are you doing here?
- Mrs. Ellis...
There was another murder
last night.
We believe it's the same man
that killed your son.
All of the other victims have suffered
from an illness or a condition and we...
- Robert was 12. He wasn't sick.
- We'd like to verify that.
And, just, how do you
plan on doing that?
We like to
conduct an autopsy.
You want to dig
my son's body up,
you want to pry him open and
search around inside him?
Yes, we do.
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.
He wasn't sick.
And even if he was,
he did not need a man like you.
It's fate.
It's just that some people
do not have the courage
to accept the wisdom of the Lord.
I agree with you, Mrs. Ellis, absolutely.
I know the limitations of medicine first hand.
As a doctor, I've diagnosed
hundred of patients
and I watched death growing
inside a lot of them.
Inside my own daughter, for example.
She had Leukemia.
For 2 whole years, all I could do
is go to the hospital every single day
sat there, watched her suffer.
Every procedure, every test,
all totally useless, of course.
And one day she died.
And that was that.
In the end, of course,
it was a bit of a blessing.
At least, I think it was.
So, yes.
I do understand something about fate,
Mrs. Ellis.
And, uh, I certainly wouldn't use
medicine to alter God's plan.
I... just want to know
why your son was killed.
And medicine can help me
discover that.
And then, perhaps, it can
help me catch the man...
...who killed your little boy.
Dr. Clancy. Fax for you.
It's marked urgent.
What is it?
Check the cerebellar lobe.
Whoa!
What's this?
- Well, here's your answer.
- What?
Brain tumor. Size of a pea.
Hidden in the cerebellar lobe.
- John?
- What's up, Doc?
Christ!
- John?
- I'm out. Finished.
The fax?
What the hell did it say?
Sir, I don't know. The fax was
marked urgent and confidential.
Jesus Christ.
Somebody trained you too well, kid.
John!
John! God damn it!
You gotta let somebody in on this!
It's a trap.
The whole thing is a trap.
And we're walking right into it.
What? What?
You gotta talk to me.
He's way ahead of us. And we're doing
exactly what he wants us to do.
Don't you get it?
I'm out.
Doctor Clancy?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead. You're paying for it.
So, we find a tumor...
that no one could've
known about.
We've established connections
between victims that, I freely admit,
I could never have seen.
And instead of stepping up
and leading from the front,
you run out of an autopsy,
which you asked for,
coincidentally,
without any explanation,
and now you're packing your bags
and you're going home.
Forgive me, Clancy,
but what the fuck?
Hmm.
"Who am I?
I will tell you in two words
who I am, what I do, and how I live."
The riddle left be the killer.
What about it?
- That's not a riddle.
- What is it?
" Le dirò con due parole chi son,
e che faccio, come vivo."
It's from the opera,
La Bohème by Puccini.
So the killer is an opera nut.
Great.
That really helps with the profile.
- Thank you, Clancy.
- No.
I'm the nut.
I'm the opera nut.
I just happened to be listening to
those lines, those exact words
the very moment I was reading
the case files you brought me.
- I... I don't get it.
- He knew I'd be listening to that music.
He knew that you would
ask me to help. Also...
He knew that we would arrive at the
apartment at exactly 4:16 am.
Because he knows everything.
You see... He's just like me.
He sees things.
Only he's better at it.
A whole lot better.
Come, read that.
Come on, read it!
"Dr. Clancy,
Check the cerebellar lobe."
Okay.
So that's why you're quitting.
You've met your match.
Oh, no.
No. This guy, he's
more than my match.
He's way beyond me.
And I can't stop him,
which begs a more important question.
Is he really worth stopping?
I mean, these people, these victims
however which we choose to call them,
they were dying anyway.
So, he's not killing them out of
compulsion, or anger, or any...
banal deviant psychosis
or anything like that.
No, he's a...
I'm the cigar, the ice cream,
the cocktails, the flowers in the bathtub
and all that whacko stuff.
No, I mean.
This guy is brilliant.
And he's killing them with kindness.
Don't you get it?
It's mercy killing.
- Oh. Bullshit!
- Is it?
- It's murder.
- Mm-hmm.
The murder that maybe sparing
a whole lot of suffering.
If this was your daughter,
 would you be saying the
same thing, Clancy, would you?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
It's just...
I know your...
I know your daughter died.
But we all die someday,
don't we?
So what is it...
...that's so terrible
that you can't talk about?
Okay!
So, here's what I'm not telling you.
You lost your virginity to a drunk kid,
good looking stud called Bruce
in the back of his green
Ford Bronco when you were 17.
You didn't like it very much because
Bruce threw up all over you after.
5 years ago, you had a more
serious boyfriend called Kevin.
No, sorry. Gavin.
You thought that might
go the distance.
But, a year into that relationship
he discovered one day, Gavin,
that you were pregnant
carrying Gavin's baby.
Gavin didn't want it but you did,
so, Gavin ran away,  he left you.
And two and a half months later,
the baby was born.
She's a beautiful little girl
called Amanda.
Really beautiful, but one day you just decided
to give her away, give her up for adoption.
You haven't seen her since.
It's breaking your heart,
tearing your guts out and
that's why you pretend
to be so foul-mouthed,
thim slick and cool.
Exactly twice a year on each of your
parents' birthdays, Doreen and Frank,
No, it's Moreen.
No, it's Doreen, isn't it?
On each of their birthdays,
November 16th and October the 23th,
you call them in Cincinnati
where they live
to tell them that you
love them both very much,
and they tell you, "We love you
very much too, honey bunny."
And then you will cry
and sob your heart out
on that red goose down pillow
you love so much.
And you'll hate my
guts, wishing me dead
for telling you all
these horrible things.
But you know what, Agent Cowles?
Nobody gives a shit.
You want me to go on?
Go ahead.
What else do you see for me, Doctor?
Just go home, Kathy.
Just go home.
Alright, straight.
Holy Mother of God.
Unsub is male, between
the ages of 18 and 35.
Mental illness likely.
Look for a man with
little personal hygiene,
someone conspicuously short
on social skills. A...
...mercurial or
an artistic temperament.
And for Christ's sakes find
the bottom half of that dress.
Sexually motivated,
excessively violent.
This isn't even close
to our guy.
Hey, cop!
Does this look familiar?
- Joe.
- John.
John.
John!
John.
Maybe you're right, John.
Maybe we can't catch this guy.
Maybe...
Maybe that's exactly what he wants,
because we found a clue, John.
And I think it's a good one.
I want you to see it.
Call it a personal favor.
You know, something bad
is going to happen.
Something really bad.
Your mystery fax was sent over
the Internet by high anonymity proxy.
So, we had trouble tracking that down.
We also did a chemical analysis
of Victoria Raymond's bathwater.
HIV positive which we knew
from the autopsy and from you.
But we found trace elements
of an anti-invertebrate toxin.
Snail poison.
On the flowers.
John, I gotta ask.
You just know this kind of weird crap
or are you seeing into
my brain right now?
Alright.
We're here.
This is where
the flowers came from.
Hey.
I owe you an apology.
I'll explain later.
- You okay?
- John.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
We shouldn't be doing this.
Over here!
Too late now.
They look clipped.
Not torn off.
I'll call forensics.
- John?
- Uh-huh?
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure.
It's over there.
The bottom half of the dress.
Shit!
Get Otis in from the 14th now!
I'm on it.
This morning, we found the top half of
the dress pasted to a wall in a tenement.
At least half the victim's blood supply.
I was sure it wasn't our guy.
Still doesn't feel right.
- Otis is here.
- And Otis is who?
Besides you,
he's the best there is.
Otis! Come on, boy.
Let's go.
- Where's the item?
- Right here. Right here.
Let's go, boy.
Find it.
Let's go! Move it up!
Let's go!
I want a 3-block perimeter.
We're on our way to Riverside.
- How far do we follow him?
- As far as he goes.
I don't trust it.
Either this is useless or...
he's leading us somewhere,
maybe into a trap right now.
What do you want me to do, John?
Not follow the lead?
No. We have to follow him.
I don't know. It's weird.
Let's go! Move it up!
Let's go!
Possible subject location.
Give me all units, now!
- You wearing a vest?
- Of course. We all are, John.
Let's go! Move it up!
Let's go!
2 men on each exit, 6 going in.
Sawyer, here, is going to run the perimeter.
Let's go.
Go!
Stairway up.
Landing.
Clear.
Stairway up.
Landing.
Clear.
Open door! Open door!
Closed door left. Closed door left.
On hallway.
Closed door right.
Closed door left.
Closed door left.
Closed door right.
Closed door right.
FBI!
Open up!
- Wait here, okay?
- Yup.
Go.
FBI!

Danger left!
Danger left!
- Left side clear.
- Right side clear.
Room clear!
Whoa!
- Do you live here, sir?
- No.
- Do you live here?
- No. This is my-This is my studio.
What's your name?
Linus.
Linus Harp.
Mr. Harp, do you know who occupies
the studio across the hall from you?
No no no...
No one does.
- Turpentine?
- I'm a painter.
That's great. Can you
please step outside with us?
Can I lock up first?
No. Your studio is safe.
Step outside.
Frogs.
Freeze!
- Man down!
- Let's move! Let's move!
Shots fired!
Agent down!
Suspect on foot!
Move!
Oh, the mother fucker jumped out the window
of the south exit. I'm coming down!
- Should we get him to county!
- John.
- What?
- How's it-How's it look?
It's not great. Come on!
Get an ambulance! Now!
Go with Katherine.
Go with Katherine.
Come on and get him!
- Sloman, you got anything?
- No sign!
- We got anything?
- Nothing.
- Anything?
- Spread out! Spread out!
- What am I looking for?
- I've no idea!
- White male suspect...
- Left!
- Left here?
- Left here.
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- On Baltimore, in pursuit.
- Agent, can you give us a visual description.
- Right!
- We will when we can.
Yellow cab.
He's stolen a yellow cab.
I need a number.
- 5, M, 4, 3.
- There!
Hey!
Look out!
We're gonna lose him!
Hey!
- Take a left.
- But, he went straight.
Take a left!
- Okay, stop!
- Just, sit back, John! I got this.
- Just, stop the car!
- John, I got this!
Stop the fucking car! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?
He's gonna get away.
He's no going to get...
Just stop the car.
- John, you want me to let him go?
- Shut up!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Alright.
Go!
- You okay?
- Yeah. Are you?
Yeah.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Hey, cop!
You're not him.
- You want a moment alone with him?
- Yeah.
- Did you get the guy?
- No, Katherine did.
Good for her.
It wasn't the guy, was it?
Nope.
So you were right.
He was just leading us
down a path.
Mm-hmm.
Handing us that psychopath, huh?
And now...
Now he's got another
terminal case to show for it.
Stage four cancer.
You'd picked up on that,
hadn't you?
I figured.
I appreciate you
not making me talk about it.
I got the diagnosis...
...a few months ago.
And...
It's too advanced
to do anything about it.
You will...
You'll check on Laura and
my little man every now and again?
Yes, of course, I will.
Hell, John!
I'm not ready to die.
I guess, uh...
You know, I'd been planning on it.
I've been expecting it for a little bit.
But... not for a few more months.
You know, I...
I have so much stuff to do.
I want to move Laura
to the country.
I want to teach
my little boy to drive.
You were always
a lousy driver.
I know.
I wanted him to
take after his dad.
You know, we, uh...
We want for so much in life,
you know?
And then we get it.
I have it.
But I've run out of time.
There's just no time left.
Well, you did a hell of a lot
with your life and time.
My friend.
- Not enough, John.
- You did.
No.
It's good having you back,
you know?
Hey.
Tell me one of your
crappy jokes.
Crappy joke, I can't.
How about I disconnect you?
Would that make you laugh?
It's true.
You really-You really fucking can't.
That smile right there.
You do me a favor.
You take that to Elizabeth, alright?
You make it up with her.
Sorry I said to you
what I said last night.
You're about to tell me
something at the park.
What was that?
Oh, yeah, I remember.
Yes, it was a...
...beautiful Sunday afternoon.
June 24th 1990.
I was watching my daughter, Emma,
playing in the garden.
Everyone singing "Happy Birthday."
It was her sixth birthday.
All the other kids were playing around
having a great time.
And suddenly, there it was.
I saw it...
Standing just behind her, behind Emma.
It was a...
... shadow.
It was moving like a curtain.
You know, like a...
... curtain moving in the breeze.
I knew what it was. It was
no trick of the light.
I could feel it
all around me and...
inside me.
Oh, God.
It was weird.
And then it just sort of faded away.
And, uh...
I didn't tell anyone, of course,
not even my wife Elizabeth, no one.
But I had no doubt,
no doubt at all.
And 20 years later,
to the exact day, she called us.
Thursday morning, 9:23.
I thought, "Okay,
This is it. Here we go."
Then came the diagnosis,
Leukemia,
followed by two years of
agonizing treatment.
Then came the worst day
of my life when she...
...died.
And she was gone.
Emma.
And on the third day,
He arose from the dead,
In accordance
with the scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and sits at the right hand
of the Father.
He will come again in glory,
to judge the living
and the dead.
And his kingdom
will have no end.
Amen.
Hey, Kevin, come here.
I know, okay.
*Give me a five.
John.
Hey.
♪ Your time is near
Anything else I
can get you, Mr.?
- Yes, I'll have the same again.
- Okay.
I wanted to meet you
for the longest time.
I can't believe
we're finally face-to-face.
Here you go.
 Sweetheart, could I have
another one of these please?
Sure thing.
John, each life I take,
it's a life that's saved
from enormous pain.
I see what lies ahead for them.
The suffering and the sickness.
I see them writhing in agony.
I hear them screaming,
begging for release.
They beg for it, John.
And I grant them their wish.
Only better.
I get there before
the wish is even made.
I get there before
the pain even starts.
As for their loved ones,
those that were left behind, well...
there's always an autopsy, and that's
when the pre-existing condition is found.
That's when I see them
go from shock to relief.
I hear them say things like,
"Thank God it was so sudden."
"At least she felt no pain."
In the end, they're grateful
for what I've done.
That's why I helped
your friend, Joe.
He had 73 days
of horrific pain ahead.
Do you know what benefits
his family would've gotten?
Dying of natural causes,
14 years into his career? None.
At least, now his wife gets a
federal line of duty pension,
that will put their son through college.
Stanford, actually.
You think Joe wouldn't have
taken that deal?
Please don't call to them.
Come on.
You know I have a gun on me.
He's got a gun!
- Gun!
- Get down!
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't seen
all the possible outcomes of this meeting.
I walk away healthy
from each one.
One version is particularly gruesome for
our waitress which would be unfortunate
as her shift ends
in a couple of minutes.
I don't enjoy the work I do.
John, it's not a fetish.
It's about allowing those
who are already dying...
...to die with some dignity.
Sometimes the greatest acts of love
are the hardest acts to commit.
Why are you giving me
the silent treatment?
I got it.
It's a lot to process.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
To be continued.
Gun!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
It's him! It's him
for Christ's sake!
Leave me alone!
It's him, get him!
Oh, he was drinking beer.
But it was non-alcoholic.
He had a scar on his forehead.
It was kind of jagged, like, scar.
The search you asked for.
All unsolved murders over
the last 10 years
which the victims themselves
with terminally ill .
- How many?
- 7.
No punctures to the medulla oblongata,
but theoretically all painless.
- Poisons, carbon monoxide.
- These are all local?
You want the national data, too?
Okay.
Is this how you see it, John?
What's Atticus?
John?
We're connected.
We're the same animal.
Does this look familiar?
I'm scared.
- Hi.
- Did she leave a note?
Concentrate, John.
Focus, John.
John!
Hey, cop!
I'm scared.
Just... focus.
Concentrate, John.
<font color="#ff8080">[Sodium Solution]</font>
Focus.
62 in the last 10 years,
ranging from Juneau to Miami Beach.
Shit!
Do one more search.
Remove the terminal constraint.
Look for other unsolves in the
same region, same time period.
The killer may have known the people
were sick when no one else did.
Run everything you find
against this description:
Male, 30s, front-left cranial scar,
almost certainly post-surgical.
Bring me everything...
anything you come across.
Okay?
Hmm.
Of course. That's what it means,
"Congratulations, partner."
I'm getting upped!
Yeah, well. That's what 20 minutes
with a rich geriatric will get you, huh.
Well, I'm the youngest partner
in the firm's history.
You can tell your friends that.
I don't know, I mean...
They bring me on... on Monday?
I guess, you know.
Whatever they think is right.
HOW to kéep—
is there ány any,
 is there none such,
nowhere known some,
bow or brooch or braid or brace,
láce, latch or catch or key to keep
Back beauty, keep it, beauty, beauty,
beauty, … from vanishing away?
Ó is there no frowning of these
wrinkles, rankéd wrinkles deep,
Dówn? no waving off of these
most mournful messengers,
still messengers, sad and
stealing messengers of Grey?
- No, there's none, there's none,
-  O no there's none,
Nor can you long be,
what you now are, called fair,
Do what you may do, what,
do what you may,
- And wisdom is early to despair:
- And wisdom is early to despair:
So be beginning.
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Charles.
Oh no, there's nothing
can be done. To keep at bay
Age and age’s evils,
hoar hair,
Ruck and wrinkle, drooping, dying,
death’s worst, winding sheets,
tombs and worms and
tumbling to decay;
Anyway, you were right about me.
I was...
- What's the word I'm looking for?
- Conflicted.
Yes.
I was conflicted about you.
Yeah, but not anymore.
Oh, no.
Yeah. You had no right to take
one hour, one minute,
not even one second of time
away from my friend, Joe Merriweather.
I don't know if you've ever known
anyone who was dying, Charles.
I mean really know them
and...
watched them struggling
on the edge of terror and horror
as they try to hold on to their
last shred of life. I don't know, but...
if you had, perhaps you would have
appreciated how time at the end is...
well, it is...
kind of precious, I guess.
At that point,
even the pain of life itself
may be quite beautiful.
You know what I mean?
Is that how
your daughter felt?
That her...
...her pain was "beautiful?"
Well, my friend, I'm afraid you're not
going to be around to find out.
Who the fuck are you guys?
Sit down and shut up.
I don't see you pulling
that trigger.
Ditto.
This is not your style.
It's not mercy.
No?
A bullet to the head is a hell of a lot
better than what he's got coming.
You see, Jeffrey here...
has a fight ahead of him
with neurofibromatosis.
And that's gonna turn him into
a writhing, crooked beast.
Tomorrow night, after a couple of cocktails,
Jeffrey gets his girlfriend pregnant.
And the real charm about NFB
is that it's hereditary.
All medical journals tells you
there's a 50 percent chance
the kid gets it,
but I can tell you now:
the kid... gets it.
- What's NFB?
- And you want to give him that suffering?
Destroy three lives in one,
all because of
some moral judgment?
We can't play God.
No. I have no interest
in playing God.
As far as His work is concerned,
I'm not impressed.
Shhh.
Shhhh.
It's okay.
Look at you.
You're so confused.
You don't even know
which one of us to shoot.
You'll figure it out soon enough.
Hey, you, call an ambulance.
You've Seconal poisoning.
You need to get to hospital. Throw up,
vomit, do whatever you have to do.
Take plenty of milk.
Good luck.
I think we got him.
Your search came back.
I crossed him with
the gun records.
Gun was purchased by a Charles Allen,
Charles Ambrose.
Oh, man.
Let's go.
Concentrate, John.
Someone dies tonight.
Don't lose me now.
FBI!
Open door right! Open door right!
Open door left! Open door left!
Move in!
Room, clear!
What is this place?
There's no furniture, nothing?
Not a bad view.
Listen!
Katherine.
Who is Charles Ambrose?
Who is he, really?
How the fuck is he doing this?
Of course, I know
what they'll look for.
Dysfunctional childhood
that involved abuse and neglect.
Later on...
couldn't hold a job,
couldn't keep a relationship.
- Wrong on all counts.
- What the....
Concentrate.
Mom never left me.
Dad never beat me.
You won't find any trace of violence
or antisocial behavior in my past.
I'm not a radical.
I have no interest
in fame or power.
I'm simply a man
who could no longer look away.
Don't stop.
God knows, I would prefer
to live the quiet life...
...away from all
that I have become.
But we don't always get
to choose what we are.
There you go.
It hurts so bad.
I'm so scared.
Officer Pearce.
My name is Charles Ambrose.
Call your supervisor,
tell him you just met me.
It will do wonders for
your career, I promise you.
Hey, Dispatch.
Officer Pearce here.
And now the savior...
needs to be saved.
Clancy doesn't want you to respond
to that call, Agent Cowles.
Sloman.
He doesn't want you to be
there when it happens....
- When?
- ... But you will.
You'll respond.
You'll be there.
You can't help yourself.
Hey.
Hey, a beat cop
just reported a Charles Ambrose
at Ashland Station.
Where are you going?
Hey! Get back here.
See you soon.
And here you are.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Just as I've seen it all those years.
You, me, this train.
You've seen it, too, right?
You've heard it?
Day after day.
Month after month.
Except something's not right.
He's got a gun!
Captain, this is Agent Cowles.
Our suspect is headed into Ashland Station.
We have radio contact
with the engineer.
We're gonna set up shop
at a station up ahead.
Have him stop the train there.
- And then what?
- We take him out.
- I advise you to stay clear from here on.
- Captain, I'm not staying clear.
We have control.
Stay clear.
Shit!
We're connected.
- The same animal.
- No, no. I'm not a killer.
Well. We can talk about
that in seven minutes.
Seven minutes?
That's when you're gonna kill someone.
- Oh. Who might that be?
- Me.
Move, Move!
Move it!
- Let's go!
- Move!
Go!
Move!
Go!
Move! Move! Move!
Train is five minutes out!
Let's go!
Move!
I'm dying, John.
I can't continue this work anymore.
That's why I need someone
to carry on for me.
Someone who can see the pain.
The suffering.
Sickness.
There's another reason you have
to shoot me which you're not seeing.
Concentrate!
John.
John.
There it is.
Thank you.
Agent Cowles.
You've grown so fond of her.
It's been like having
your daughter back, huh?
I'm sorry.
You've lost me, Charles.
She doesn't fit your profile, pattern.
She's not even ill.
So.
Why would you kill her?
You're right. Of course, I won't kill her.
She's a perfectly healthy young woman.
That's the beauty of it, John.
You're going to stop me first.
Yes.
With one bullet, right here.
- And after that, there's no turning back.
- No. Sorry, my friend.
The game stops here.
Now.
I want 4 shooters, 3 low, 1 high!
Train is 60 seconds out.
Let's go.
Move!
FBI!
- Ma'am, you got to...
- FBI! Let me through!
Look at me, John.
Does this look familiar?
See now?
All your visions are becoming real.
50 seconds to target.
Do you have a visual?
Captain.
- Do you have a shot?
- Affirmative.
She's going to make it
just in time.
- Take the shot!
- Take the shot!
Fuck!
I lost him!
Gold team.
Take the shot! Take the shot!
Target is locked.
Let's go!
Say hello to your destiny, John.
Out of the way, sir!
Visual on tango.
Fire!
Hold!
Hold!
I told you you'd kill me.
Clear to fire!
Clear to fire!
Fire!
- John.
- You're okay.
You're okay.
Oh, hi.
Hey.
- How are you doing?
- I spoke to the chief surgeon.
He said the surgery was a success.
- Good.
- He said the bullet went clean through.
I was hoping you would
consider a reinstatement.
As Joe said, we'd make a...
a hell of a team.
Oh no, I want a quiet life.
Yeah.
Joe would be proud of you.
Don't cry.
You're a good kid.
It was good
working with you, John.
- I'll see you around.
- See you around.
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.
Oh, yeah, um...
Nearly forgot.
Could you help me with this?
See it gets delivered.
I got it.
Joe.
Hello, Elizabeth.
Hello, John.
You look so beautiful.
I read your letter.
Several times.
It's different
than the others.
Which way?
It's all about the past.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I think of Emma.
Every single day.
Okay.
Come here.
It's okay.
Oh, my.
It hurts.
I'm scared.
I'm so scared.
Oh, my....
It hurts.
Sometimes, the greatest acts of love...
...are the hardest acts to commit.
Let's walk, shall we?
See you soon, John.
