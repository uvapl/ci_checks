We start with breaking news.
- Previously on "Notorious"...
- My client, Oscar Keaton,
was arrested for his wife's murder
without a shred of evidence.
"LHL" welcomes Los Angeles
District Attorney Max Gilford.
Oscar Keaton is guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt.
That man's a natural.
Not to mention he's hot.
Can I buy you a drink?
I was in love with Sarah.
And the night before she was murdered,
we slept together.
I want to see my damn lawyer!
You were sleeping with my wife.
You're fired.
Well, I guess we got our answer.
Oscar didn't know about the affair.
Now get me everything
you can on Jake Gregorian.
Ms. George.
I'm glad you came.
Of course.
But I was surprised to get your call.
Please.
You and Jake Gregorian... you're, uh,
close, right?
I'm not sure what you're asking.
I fired him.
- Really?
- Turns out he slept with my wife
the night before she was killed.
Oscar, what am I doing here?
I want the world to know
the truth about Jake.
I want to tell my story.
And we're back in three, two...
Welcome back. For our
final segment tonight,
we go live to the L.A. County Jail
to speak with accused
murderer Oscar Keaton.
Oscar, you have a bombshell to drop.
- Let's get right to it.
- My attorney,
Jake Gregorian, has betrayed
me in the most atrocious way.
The man had sex with my wife
the night before she was murdered.
That's quite an allegation.
While in jail, I received a photo
of the two of them in bed together.
- I confronted Jake.
- Cue the photo.
- He came clean.
- "LHL" has obtained a copy
- of that photo.
- I thought this man was my greatest ally.
Turns out he was just acting in his own
vicious self-interest...
which is why I fired Jake Gregorian.
I don't trust the man.
Neither should the district attorney,
- neither should the public.
- Can you elaborate?
Maybe Sarah was planning
on telling me the truth.
Maybe Jake killed Sarah to
keep their affair a secret.
Hold on. You're accusing
Jake Gregorian of murder?
I'm just saying it wouldn't surprise me.
Ask the question, Louise.
Oscar, wouldn't your wife's
infidelity speak to your motive?
I mean, if you knew about the affair,
I can only imagine the
anger, your sense of betrayal.
Like I said, I didn't
know about the affair.
Yes. Well, we'll have to
take your word on that.
And our time is up.
From all of us at "Louise
Herrick Live," good night.
And we're clear.
Nice job, Louise.
Hey, Jake.
Louise's timing on that
last question was perfect.
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for the heads-up on the interview.
Louise knocked Oscar's
smug ass back in the dirt.
Now it's my job to dust him off.
Wait, you're gonna
keep working with him?
- Of course I am.
- He just fired you on national television
and accused you of murder.
It's not a bad Yelp review.
He attacked me in the media.
Once he hires me back,
all will be forgotten.
Seriously, though, Jules...
thanks. I owe you one.
Eternally.
Hey, boss. Quite a show, huh?
Yeah, a solid segment.
But have you been
following the competition?
I hope you're not talking
about Callie Connors.
Oh, yeah. Last night, she got
her highest ratings of the year.
She's got a follow-up story on now.
Darin, we shouldn't be
taking our cues from her.
- I'm not saying to...
- Because her show is a circus of tacky,
pandering histrionics...
and she still loses to us every night.
What I am saying is that if this is
the next Natalee Holloway
or Elizabeth Smart,
we're already behind.
42 hours since Emily Parker,
a gorgeous honor-roll
student and cheer captain,
was reported missing
- from her Pasadena home.
- And here it comes.
It's Crying Callie tonight.
Friends
it is just heart-breaking to think
that some dark force...
Dark force... Vaguely Racist
Callie joins the party.
Emily's parents have yet
to make a public statement,
but I can only imagine their
sense of loss and dread.
We need those parents.
Every moment wondering
where their daughter is.
Julia, please.
You can just feel
their grief, can't you?
Fine.
Jake's firm represents the parents,
and he owes me a favor.
Expose a guy's affair with a dead woman
and he owes you?
Twisted, but I'll take it.
- Yeah.
- Jake, I want Emily Parker's parents.
What took you so long?
I want them to sit down
with Louise tomorrow
- for the whole hour if they're up for it.
- I'll make it happen.
The front door was wide open.
A lamp in the entry was knocked over.
We called the police.
And the police came in minutes, but
it felt like hours.
Emily was just getting
further and further away.
Mm.
Laurie, Ted, that was great.
But in the 24-hour news cycle,
you get exactly one shot
to make these viewers care.
All right? The ring twists, Ted...
it could read as an unstable marriage.
Lack of eye contact hints at a secret.
And if the viewers get caught
up in those distractions,
they're not thinking about what matters,
which is your missing daughter.
JonBenét Ramsey's parents
had one bad interview on CNN,
never crawled out from under it.
Hey.
You guys are gonna be great.
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Look, Jake, we got to ask.
After Oscar Keaton said that
stuff about you on the news,
are... are you sure you
can help us right now?
Ted, I made a stupid, stupid mistake.
But this firm is fully focused
on helping you find Emily.
The media rollout is catching fire.
That means more police on the case,
more pressure on those police
until Emily comes home.
Okay?
Okay.
Why don't we call it a day.
We'll meet tomorrow,
we'll prep one more time...
... and then we'll head over
to "Louise Herrick Live."
Uh, actually, we need to talk
to you about the interview.
On the way over, we received an offer
to do an exclusive on
Callie Connors' show.
They offered us $100,000.
"Louise Herrick Live"
never pays for interviews,
but I can assure you
it is the better option.
We need the money to fund the search.
We've already spent that much on
private investigators, scent dogs,
a search helicopter.
Callie Connors... she's unpredictable.
I have an existing relationship
with Julia George and "LHL."
I know it's not ideal,
but we're going with Callie.
Jake, you promised me their interview.
Not to mention Callie
Connors is an unstable mess
and her show is a huge gamble.
I mean, depending on her mood,
she could rip the parents apart.
True, Julia, but it's not like your show
is all sunshine and softballs.
I'm sorry, Julia.
Really.
Hey, Julia, listen,
I think we should match
Callie's offer to the parents.
- We don't do that.
- I don't mean paying for an interview.
Rather, a donation to the
Find Emily Parker fund.
Darin, no.
Research just gave me the heads up...
Callie beat us last night.
First time in seven months.
If she owns this Emily Parker story,
we're gonna keep on losing.
What the hell are you doing here?
I want you to rehire
me as your attorney.
You're insane.
You accused me of killing Sarah.
Now, you can either double down, Oscar,
which will backfire as pundits speculate
on whether or not you knew
about your wife's affair,
or I can go on TV
and issue a mea culpa
stating that I did,
in fact, regretfully,
sleep with your wife
and then state with absolute certainty
that you had no knowledge whatsoever
about Sarah's infidelity.
Your ego...
... just can't handle
the fact that I fired you.
It's a conflict waiver.
It states that you are rehiring me
with absolute faith in the
efficacy of my representation.
You doing this for me or for you?
Does it matter?
Either shank me with this
pen or sign the damn document.
I'm your best shot out of
here, and we both know it.

Hey.
I've been digging deep on Emily Parker.
She's got an aunt and uncle in Denver,
but they're not returning calls.
I reached a couple of her classmates,
but no one's gonna stack
up against her parents.
I hate that we are
chasing Callie Connors.
I hate that two shows are
fighting over one missing girl
when 600 girls go
missing every year in L.A.
- 600?
- Yeah.
When I was researching Emily,
I went into the database.
Of course, those 600 aren't
all blonde, blue-eyed,
and upper-middle-class
like Emily.
"Princess stolen from her
castle" is the story that sells.
You know what?
Let Callie do it the easy
way. She found a princess.
I say we create one.
- What are you talking about?
- I want to go with one of the other 599,
and we are gonna make her just as big
and just as important as Emily.
We are gonna make the whole country
care about a girl they
never even knew existed.
Natalee Holloway.
Elizabeth Smart.
Emily Parker.
You know their names and their stories.
You've held your breath
along with their parents,
hoping that they would be found.
But tonight you'll be seeing
the faces of other young women
who have gone missing,
whose names are tragically unfamiliar.
These are young women
whose disappearances
have devastated their
families and friends,
yet garnered little
to no media attention,
which all too often goes hand-in-hand
with a lack of police attention.
And you'll hear the story of one
of these overlooked young women.
Silvia Baez's daughter,
Rosa, is 17 years old.
She lives just six
miles from Emily Parker,
and went missing the exact same night.
Silvia, what happened to Rosa?
My daughter works at
a burger drive-through.
She walks home every night at 9:00.
Three nights ago,
she didn't come home.
I understand you're disappointed
in the police response?
Yes. I called them,
and it took them two
hours to come to my house.
And they refused to ping
Rosa's phone to locate her.
I'm sorry. Why would they refuse?
They say it would cost the city $150,
and their budget wouldn't allow it.
"Be patient," they say.
"She'll show up."
Well, she hasn't.
And now it's too late for the phone.
Her battery is dead.
I miss her so much.
If you could say something to Rosa,
what would you want her to hear?
Rosa, mija,
I'm praying for you,
and I will do anything
to bring you back home.
If any of our viewers
know anything about Rosa,
there's an 800 number on our website.
Please call.
Before we go tonight,
a humble admission and a plea.
We realize that tonight's
story was a departure,
that our network has been guilty
of choosing certain victims over others.
We will make every
attempt to remedy that.
But I'd also like to
call on Callie Connors
and other outlets to
make the same efforts
and make sure every victim
gets an equal chance.
Good night.
And clear.
I was digging through Emily
Parker's online history,
looking for anything that
may aid in the investigation.
- Mm-hmm.
- Emily Parker's username
on a cheerleading forum is "BabyDoll99."
When I did a global search of
that name, look what I found.
Cam Girl Paradise.
Girls who use their personal webcams
to strip for paying strangers.
Take a look at this.
BabyDoll99 is Emily Parker.
Tell me what you want to see...
what you want me to do.
I'm up for anything.
Just ask.
Jake, she's only 16.
You need to tell her parents,
and then the police.
Friends,
I have come back on air tonight
to address something that simply
cannot wait until tomorrow's show.
I need to respond to a
cheap shot thrown at me
by the desperate folks over
at "Louise Herrick Live."
Earlier tonight, they accused me
of neglecting the case
of missing girl Rosa Baez.
Just so we're clear,
I've been so laser-focused
on Emily Parker's story
- 'cause nobody has any idea...
- Geez.
... what happened to Emily.
There is tragically little mystery
in what happened to Rosa Baez.
What is she talking about?
This is the thug responsible
for Rosa Baez's disappearance...
her boyfriend, Braydon Lucas,
a felon, grand theft auto.
Rosa had the misfortune of
dating this piece of work.
Police are investigating
him for Rosa's disappearance,
and it's only a matter of
time until the truth comes out.
She's wrong.
I mean, yeah, the boyfriend
came up in my research
as a person of interest...
he's even in my file. But...
the police quickly
questioned and released him.
So she's condemning him
based on his mugshot?
That's how she works.
Her audience laps it up.
... to make a petty,
hateful attack on our show.
- Instead...
- She accuses us
of taking a cheap shot?
We're gonna show her how
this job is really done.
We're gonna find out what
happened to Rosa Baez.
Where do we start?
I want to talk to this boyfriend.
Yes?
Uh, I... I'm looking for Braydon Lucas.
I was told he might be staying here.
Who the hell are you?
I'm a news producer.
I'm doing a story on Rosa Baez.
News producer?
From that show that lit me up on TV?
Called me some felon?
Called me a thug? You
think I didn't see that?
- That's a different show.
- They're all the same show.
You think you can call me out like that
and then stroll up here just to chat?
You think that's how
this is gonna go down?!
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
I can leave.
Forget about Rosa.
Megan.
For once in her life,
Callie Connors might be
right about something.
I met the boyfriend,
and he is not warm and fuzzy,
- that's for sure.
- What happened? Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I want Ryan to follow
this guy for a day or two.
Okay.
From a safe distance,
have him follow Braydon.
If he did something to Rosa,
maybe he could lead us to her.
No problem. I'll talk to him now.
Samantha is our daughter's best friend.
We asked her if she knew
anything about this...
this cam-girl site.
Turns out she knew all about
it and didn't say anything!
- I'm sorry. I thought...
- You're not in trouble, Samantha.
Just tell Jake what
you told us about Emily.
Please.
Emily said that it was just a
way to make some extra money.
She'd been doing it for maybe a month,
and since you never
had to touch the guys,
it seemed safe and easy.
In her own bedroom.
In our house.
How could we not know?
Someone who watched her videos
may have tracked her down.
We informed the police.
Can they get a list of names?
The site uses TOR networks
and viewers pay with Bitcoin,
so it's impossible to identify them.
Did Emily ever mention
any particular men
who contacted her through the site?
No, not to me.
Have you told anyone else?
Who?
Samantha, please.
Um, the lady from the news...
the one that's covering the story.
- Callie Connors?
- Yeah.
The producer from that show
came to the café where I work.
He said he was trying to find her
and if I knew anything that
would help, I should tell him.
- Oh, God.
- No, I asked if it could be
confidential, and he said yes!
I knew you'd be upset,
but I just wanted to help her.
Callie can't air this.
If someone from that
website has Emily, this...
this story could freak him out.
- He could do something to...
- I will go talk to Callie.
I think I can persuade
her not to run the story.
Sorry for the interruption.
The D.A.'s here.
He's waiting in the conference room.
I'll be in touch.
Do you ever call before you show up,
or is the element of
surprise your thing?
I heard Oscar Keaton hired you back.
Now I've known defendants
who would drop a lawyer 'cause
they didn't like their cologne,
so to keep one who seduced his wife...
Oscar must really believe in you.
What are you doing here?
Sarah's final autopsy report came in.
And you just rushed over to
share it with the defense?
The report only tells part of the story.
It says that Sarah Keaton
had parturition scars
consistent with having given birth
at some point in her life. So
I'm here to ask you and your client,
where the hell is Sarah's child?
We talked about having children,
you know, someday, but,
no, nothing about a pregnancy.
She wasn't just
pregnant. She gave birth.
She never said anything to you?
No, but I have an investigator
digging through hospital records.
You want to find this kid?
Don't you?
Kid has nothing to do with me.
That child is a part of Sarah.
So was the fake passport,
having an affair with you. Now this?
Every day that goes by,
I feel like I know that woman less.
Alan. Jake Gregorian.
I have nothing to say to you.
- I saw the news.
- Listen, Oscar's rehired me.
There's a question about your sister
no one's been able to answer.
- What is it?
- Come down to my office to talk.
Tonight. Thanks.
Sure, I was working with Rosa
the night she went missing.
Real sweet girl, never
missed a day of work.
And you said she clocked out at 9:00?
Yeah, that's the last I saw her.
You said you were... ?
- A friend of her family.
- Oh.
Did anything strange happen
the night of her shift?
Uh, nope. Nothing strange
happens around here.
Although a garter snake
once swam out the toilet.
What about her
boyfriend... Braydon Lucas?
Was he here that night?
I wouldn't have a clue.
I noticed that you
have, uh, a video camera.
Think I could see the footage?
That needs to be approved by corporate,
and corporate has his lazy
ass on a cruise, so I'm sorry.
But you can come back next week.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Sorry I couldn't help.
It's okay.
Bueno.
I owe my viewers the whole truth.
I never hide anything.
It's a sacred responsibility.
That's interesting. I
think you owe it to Emily
to forget the cam-girl stuff.
- Here you go.
- You know revealing that part of the story
is gonna turn public
sympathy against her.
People are gonna stop volunteering
for the search parties,
the tip lines are gonna go quiet, and
Emily's chances of
being brought home alive
- are gonna plummet.
- You are not gonna pin that on me.
The most likely abductor is somebody
who discovered Emily
on the cam-girl site.
Now, if you reveal that the police
are pursuing from that angle,
the abductor might panic,
maybe even kill her.
Okay, that is one barge
load of speculation.
So you're willing to risk a girl's life
- just to bump your ratings?
- Okay, okay.
If I drop the cam-girl story,
what have you got for me?
- You get me.
- Oh.
An exclusive announcement
on the Oscar Keaton case.
Does Julia George know you're
offering yourself to other newswomen?
Do we have a deal?
Exclusive on the Oscar Keaton case?
Oscar has actually
hired me back, Callie,
and I'd be telling your viewers why.
I need to think about
it. I'll get back to you.
So, what exactly are we looking for?
Anything suspicious that happened
during Rosa's last shift.
It's cued up to the right night.
Here you go.
- Speed it up.
- ... you.
Have you heard anything from Ryan?
He's been following the boyfriend
but hasn't seen anything
incriminating so far.
- Mm.
- He did ask if we reimburse for gas.
What did you say?
I said it depends on your mood.
Good answer.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.
Back it up. Mm-hmm.
Yeah,
I need a Coke and some criss-cut fries.
We're not serving those tonight.
Don't toy with me, kid!
I want some criss-cut fries now.
Sir, we're not serving them tonight.
- Have a nice night.
- Does it...
does it look like I'm playin'?!
You want me to pull you
out of that window? I will!
Go now, or I'm calling the police.
Shut up!
That is a lot of rage over fries.
Yeah, and this happened an
hour before her shift ended.
Can you back it up again?
Freeze it right there.
Julia, what exactly
are you asking me to do?
Rosa Baez went missing
shortly after an
altercation with this guy.
And I was hoping you could
run that partial plate.
This is cop work. You
know I'm the D.A., right?
LAPD said running a
partial could take weeks.
I was hoping you could
expedite it for me.
Do you know this girl?
No.
Her mother filed a report,
but the police haven't lifted a finger.
I just need a name.
I can do better than that.
Track him down and we'll bring him in.
Thank you.
Uh, for the record,
I don't mind being used by
you as long as it's mutual.
Well, the next time you need something
in front of 10 million viewers,
- you know where to find me.
- Good to know.
And the next time I need an audience
of one for some decent Italian food?
How's Friday night?
Perfect.
Welcome back to the show.
And now a disturbing and exclusive twist
in the Emily Parker case.
This is the Emily Parker
we have all fallen in love with.
But I've discovered there's
another side to this girl.
As it turns out, our
Emily... our perfect Emily,
from the perfect family...
well, she'd been moonlighting
as a cam-girl stripper.
Tell me what you want to see...
what you want me to do.
I'm up for anything.
Just ask.
It's hard to watch, isn't it?
Are you gonna call the parents?
Brad, they're watching.
What could I possibly say?
Imagine, friends,
this child exposing her private parts
to strangers from her own bedroom,
and her parents had no idea.
Have a nice night.
Does it... does it
look like I'm playin'?!
You want me to pull you
out of that window! I will!
Go now, or I'm calling the police!
Shut up!
Not a good look for me, is it?
Why don't you tell me
about that night, Gavin?
I was hungry... like, starving, really,
and when I get starving,
I get, like passionate,
which is, like, a
blood-sugar thing for me,
and I'm pretty sure I
missed lunch that day, so...
This girl you threatened...
- Rosa Baez.
- Yeah?
What'd you do to her
after this altercation?
What do you mean?
Rosa Baez went missing shortly
after you threatened her.
What did you do to her?
No, no, no, no! God, no!
I... I didn't touch her!
I figured you brought me
in here about the drugs,
which, I mean, she didn't even sell me.
The drugs?
Yeah, you know, the...
the criss-cut fries.
Which is what... code?
Yeah, for oxy.
That burger joint serves you
whatever you're fiending for.
They got this whole, like,
psychoactive secret menu.
Do you think people are
going there for their food?
Nah, man!
Like, a stack of bibles, I
swear I did not hurt that girl.
You know, after she oxy-blocked me,
I went across town, got
creative at a pharmacy.
Check their cameras. You'll see me.
I swear.
We'll do that.
Sounds like an alibi.
Yeah, you can't make
up a story like that.
And if that's the kind
of place Rosa was working,
anything could have happened to her.
Look, Alan,
I have to ask you a tough
question about your sister.
Sarah's autopsy report says...
that she had a child.
Do you know anything about that?
I haven't thought about
that in a long time.
Our parents were devout,
and Sarah was 17 years old
when she told them the news.
I don't think she or that
idiot boy from the choir
had even heard of birth control.
What happened to the child?
Our parents sent Sarah
to live with our aunt
in New Mexico until she delivered.
Baby was a little girl.
She was sick, lived for three days.
No funeral.
Sarah came home,
looked like a ghost until
she finished high school.
You know, Alan, she
never told me any of this.
We never spoke about it.
She was ashamed.
And the family acted
like it never happened.
A development tonight in the search
for missing Los Angeles girl Rosa Baez.
The fast-food restaurant
where Rosa was employed
has been raided by the LAPD
and exposed as a
drug-trafficking outpost.
Exclusive video shows
the police operation.
Restaurant manager Miguel Ortiz
is alleged to be the mastermind
of the criminal enterprise.
He's been charged with
multiple counts of possession
and sale of a controlled substance,
and has been released after
posting a substantial bail.
Unfortunately, no new information
regarding Rosa Baez's
disappearance has come to light.
Look to "LHL" or LHL Online
for further developments.
And cut.
What's going on?
I followed the boyfriend all over town,
and one thing's for
sure: He needs money.
It's like a non-stop
scramble for quick cash...
selling scrap metal, pawning stuff,
trying his luck at payday-loan shops.
A guilty man trying to
raise money to skip town.
I don't think so. I... I got
a look inside his apartment.
He hasn't packed any bags.
Doesn't look like he's
taking off anytime soon.
Trying to raise a bunch of cash
when your girlfriend is missing?
There's another possibility.
Braydon.
I need to talk to you.
Damn it, lady. Go away!
I'm not going anywhere.
Listen, I know you need
money. Is it ransom?
Are you trying to save Rosa?
Is that why you need the cash?
- Leave me alone.
- Listen to me.
I don't work for Callie Connors.
I never said you were guilty.
I'm trying to help Rosa.
And I think you are, too.
No.
Let me help.
S...
I think we're too late.
Rosa never wanted to be
working in that restaurant,
selling drugs to addicts,
but her mom set her up with the job,
and then she couldn't get out of it.
Silvia knew what was
going on in that place?
Silvia...
Silvia goes back in the day
with that creep-ass manager Miguel.
She offered Rosa up to him.
What... does that mean?
She promised him she
would never snitch on him.
And Silvia got paid for Rosa's work,
- and Rosa didn't make a dime.
- Why didn't Rosa just quit?
If she'd tried to walk
away, he'd have killed her.
So Rosa and I came up
with a plan to escape.
Every night for the last month,
Rosa skimmed from the register.
Almost two grand.
But it's what she was owed.
We put it down on a
place in another city.
You think Miguel found out
and did something to her?
After she went missing,
Miguel shows up to my apartment.
Says he knows Rosa's
been stealing from him.
Says if I ever want to see her again,
I have to pay him 10
grand by tomorrow night.
I have sold...
everything I own.
And I'm still $5,000 short.
That girl saved my life when I met her.
She got me off the game.
She made me go back to school.
And I can't save her?
We need to tell the police.
No.
Miguel says, if I go to the cops,
he'll kill her.
You need to trust me.
Okay?
The fallout from the cam-girl story
has been even worse than we thought.
People online are
saying Emily deserved...
whatever happened to her.
We had hundreds of
strangers searching for her.
Now our closest friends are
slow to pick up our calls.
I am so sorry I couldn't stop the story.
If I had it my way, I'd
cut out Callie's tongue
for what she did, but
time isn't on our side.
I'd say start another phone tree,
pass out more flyers, make
another Internet appeal...
whatever it takes to bring her home.
- Just keep moving.
- Okay.
Keep us posted.
Jake, more mail that's been forwarded
- from the Keaton house.
- Thank you.
Something else?
You didn't do anything wrong.
I heard you apologizing
to Emily's parents.
You did everything you could.
_
_
I got to say,
you put on one hell of an act.
What are you talking about?
Did you really think you
could go on national television
and no one would dig into your story?
I know about you and Miguel Ortiz.
Your daughter worked?
She made the money so
you wouldn't have to?
Do you know where she is?
I swear,
I don't know what happened to her.
- I don't know who took her.
- I do.
- Miguel Ortiz has her.
- No.
I... it's not him.
- He's known her since she was a kid.
- Right.
He wouldn't hurt her. He would
just use her to sell drugs
out of his disgusting drive-through.
She messed with his money, Silvia.
People do crazy things for money,
like let their kid work
for some scumbag drug dealer
and then pretend like they miss them
when what they really miss
is the money they were bringing in.
- That's why you want her back, isn't it?
- No.
I want her back because I love her.
And, yes, I've mad mistakes. Okay?
But I want to make it all up to her.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
'Cause I know exactly what you can do.
And if you refuse,
you can explain yourself to the cops.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I got this, uh,
letter about a new passcode.
Uh, unless you're Mrs. Sarah Keaton,
I can't give you a
unit number or a code.
Uh, my name is Jake Gregorian.
Um, I'm representing
Mrs. Keaton's estate.
Well, Mr. Gregorian, you didn't mention
you were co-registered on the unit.
Got some I.D.?
Yes, I do.

Remember Spain?
We took that train from
Salamanca to Barcelona?
- Mm-hmm.
- You held my hand.
I never trusted anyone like that.
It's Jake.
Hi, Jake, it's Megan.
Just confirming you'll
be on the show tonight.
We're an hour out.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Thanks.
We have the warrant. We're going in.
Gregorian just left the facility.
Let's do it.
Cops tore this place apart!
I'm facing 5 to 10 on that
narco rap, and bail bled me dry.
Your kid's got a lot to answer for.
- Do you have any idea where she is?
- Yeah.
She ran off. That's where she is!
Please, Miguel. I just
want to know she's okay.
Silvia, your kid is a thief
and her boyfriend is a punk,
but I didn't take her.
And we're done talking
about your little bitch.
This is her fault,
bringing attention to my operation.
You give the mom any pointers?
How you get an interview to crack?
I'm begging you.
I told her tears are always good.
Let me just see her.
Let me speak to her, just for a minute.
Plays a concerned
mother pretty damn well.
- Maybe there's a scrap of truth in it.
- I can't sleep!
- I can hardly breathe!
- Look, she is fine, okay?
My cousin Tomás is
taking good care of her,
which is better than she deserves.
His cousin.
She needs a little more
time to learn her lesson.
Yeah, it's Gilford. We may have a lead.
How'd it go? Is she okay?
Rosa's fine. She and
Braydon have left town.
I thought you'd want them for the show,
when we tell the world how you
you kicked ass and saved her.
We don't do that.
I'm not the story.
You made the world care about Rosa.
You can't just leave
our viewers in the dark.
When she's safe and settled...
... we'll do an update.
Okay.
- Afternoon, ladies.
- Thank God you're here.
- We're 10 minutes till air, Jake.
- Oh.
I guess that means I'm
8 1/2 minutes early.
You're all dusty.
You okay?
Never better.
I can't wait to tell your viewers
all about my affair with
Sarah. It's gonna be...
great. Come on, let's go.
Good evening. I'm joined tonight
by attorney Jake Gregorian,
who until recently
represented Oscar Keaton,
awaiting trial for the
murder of his wife, Sarah.
Jake, I understand you'd
like to make an announcement?
Yes, uh, I'm actually
pleased to share the news
that Oscar Keaton has
rehired me as his attorney.
And how in the world did
you persuade him to do that?
Because, last we heard from Oscar,
he was accusing you of
sleeping with his wife.
Yes. Uh,
it was one night...
a moment of regrettable
weakness for both of us...
which has absolutely
no bearing on this case.
Oscar and I are focused
on moving forward,
finding the real killer.
That's the only thing that matters.
- With that single purpose in mind...
- What are you doing here?
Good to see you, Julia. I'm, uh...
I'm here for work.
... way of securing
justice for my client.
Oscar Keaton is an innocent man.
- Cover that other exit.
- And I'm just happy to be returning to the job
of proving that to the world.
I'm sorry, viewers, I don't
mean to interrupt this interview,
but it appears there are
several policemen on my set.
Put the "A" camera on the cops.
Excuse me, Officers, you
realize we're live on the air?
Sorry, ma'am. I'm here
for Jake Gregorian.
Officer, whatever it is you need,
in a few minutes, I'd
be happy to help you.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.
Max, what the hell is going on?
Police received an anonymous tip
Jake had rented a storage unit.
He was hiding the murder weapon.
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.
You are being charged with homicide
in the death of Sarah Keaton.
Stand up and put your
hands behind your back.
I'm innocent of these charges.
- Viewers, if you're just...
- This is a setup.
- It has to be.
- Find out where they're booking him.
Call watch command to discuss bail.
Anyone hears from Jake, I'm on my way.
Police officers are leading him
off the set at this very moment.
You couldn't have given me a heads up?
- I'm sorry. I couldn't.
- ... to a police station for questioning.
Are we staying on this?
Should we cut the feed?
Uh, no. Louise, go to commercial.
Hell no, Louise. We're staying
on the air. Keep talking.
Put a handheld camera on his face.
Tight on his face now.
Follow him all the way
out to the parking lot.
... to announce he'd been
rehired by Oscar Keaton,
despite the sexual relationship
he shared with Oscar's wife, Sarah.
He was in the middle of
reiterating his support
for his client when police officers
arrived to arrest him live on the air.
The timing of it was...
I've just gotten word
that there's an update
on the Emily Parker case...
and this is breaking news.
As police sources have
confirmed that the body of...
of Emily Parker has been... found.
The discovery was made in a vacant lot
in downtown Los Angeles.
This is...
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm just, um...
According to an LAPD spokesperson,
a homicide victim
brutally killed within
the past few hours.
At this time, there are no leads.
