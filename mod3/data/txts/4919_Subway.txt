Lend me $20,000, and you get
your papers back.
Lend? You intend to pay it back?
I don't want your money,
letters, photos...
Except one photo of you,
when you were a kid.
9 years old, 60 lbs!
Already a beauty.
Give it to me:
I'll come down to $10,000.
OK.
What? Repeat that?
Where and when?
In the subway...
Tonight at 10 p.m., OK?
Don't overdo it.
Got the papers?
Was it hard to find?
No problem. Got the papers?
Thanks. I love this picture.
The papers!
You're rough on me.
I am? Why?
I dunno, it's nice seeing
you again in a quiet spot.
Your place was noisy and crowded.
"The papers!" You're a spoilsport.
You're the spoilsport!
Why did you blow the safe in my home?
Because I hate safes!
Not funny!
Is this funny?
We said $10,000.
Minus expenses!
Thanks for coming.
Be reasonable.
You wrecked my office and my car.
That's enough!
Why'd you invite me to your party?
Because you seemed...
No longer?
I like you.
But you're unbearable.
You're lovely:
the dress, the jewels.
Thanks.
Your hair's still messy.
Look who's talking!
Will I see you again?
I don't think so.
I think I will!
Stop!
Go check over there. Go on!
Hello, Lieutenant.
Let's see the log.
The Skater again!
Never fails. I figured it up:
he commits 11 crimes a week.
You're into statistics now?
Guess so.
You being paid to loaf?
Lieutenant!
Quit talking and go get me coffee.
Let's get to it.
Who's with me tonight?
Batman and Robin.
The best!
Tough!
Evening, Lieutenant!
Hi!
It's Fred.
Did I wake you?
What do you think?
Sorry. I wanted to talk to you.
I don't believe it.
What do you want from me?
Trying to find out
how much I can take?
Not at all.
I just want to talk to you
At 2 a.m.
OK... Go ahead.
What's your first name?
Helena.
Helena...
I love you.
Was that him?
Yes.
- Any news?
- Yes. He says he loves me.
What?
Anyone here?
Who are you?
Why are you here?
On vacation!
- Go slower!
- No, we can't stay here.
Why?
Bad neighborhood.
Wait. I'm bushed!
How did you get here?
By chance.
OK, bye.
Know how I can get rid of this?
You don't hide your troubles.
Hi, Big Bill.
My pal's got a problem.
Show him.
He ditched the other guy.
Work that muscle!
I said he was OK.
Nice place.
He's got a nice place.
Show him what you can do!
Come here!
Great!... Big... Bill... Great!
Hate to ask, but I'm hungry.
Want retirement pay, too?
Why are you down here?
Good question! Can I trust you?
No, but go ahead.
I'm doing a subway story.
Sure! In handcuffs!
Yeah, they're no trouble.
Who was it in the photo?
- My wife.
- You're married.
No... engaged.
Who's the booze for?
A buddy's birthday party.
Wanna come?
I love birthdays.
What took you so long?
I brought a pal, OK?
Happy birthday!
Hi, Big Bill.
- Know him?
- Quit buggin' me.
- You're talented!
- Thanks.
Who's that guy?
- A reporter.
- A what?
I've got a singer, a great singer.
We're forming a group.
He wrote this.
Happy birthday Yourself.
When did you call back?
About 4 a.m.
He didn't discuss money?
No. He said he'd return the papers...
But first he wanted to see you. Alone.
Then get lost!
Who can live in this dump?
Never any sun. A real nowhere.
A little light helps!
Reams you out!
What a get-up!
Find yourself an outfit.
Get rid of that...
You look like a tourist.
Miss?
Mrs! Hello. I'd like to see
Lieutenant...Gesberg.
What's it about?
It's personal.
He's not here now. But he'll be back.
Care to wait in his office?
Yes, thank you.
Up already?
Yup...
Great jacket!
Think so?
Real good.
Got something to discuss with you.
Deal that might interest you.
Let's do it over coffee?
Coffee?
Drummer boy's awake!
Every Friday at 7 a.m. sharp,
2 guys from...
security come down from
the head cashier's office.
They take the train to
the next station.
By then it's too late to do a thing.
But while they're on the platform,
they have to wait a couple of
minutes for the train.
That's when you pull a gun on them.
Then you beat it with the loot:
through the tunnel,
I know the passages by heart.
What do you say? It's a sure thing!
Cut that out, OK?
Got a gun?
Let's see.
3 bullets?
Still, be careful.
See what it's like to tell a guy
you'll blow his brains out?
Keep still!
Scared? I'm scared too that
it'll go off on its own.
My hands are clammy.
That'd be a shame.
Quit clowning!
Stop that tap-tapping! It's a drag!
What a fathead!
What is it?
That girl...
I swiped her purse.
Why'd you pick her?
I don't pick.
I grab what I can.
Miss.
So he's a captain now!
He's gone up in the world!
How's my pal Lorenzini?
My husband knows him. I don't.
You haven't missed a thing.
What's the problem?
What is it?
I need to check the files.
So tell me all.
This way.
Wait here.
I'll get the duty officer.
Excuse me, Lt.
What now?
Another theft, Mr Batman.
The Skater?
Fetch us some coffees, since it's
on your way. For you, madame?
If it's real coffee.
The last one tasted of...
Of soup!
I've told him for months!
Go on, go on!
Fill out this form.
Your name and first name here.
The contents of your bag.
Here describe how it happened.
Sign at the bottom.
Fill out both forms: I've no carbons.
Any chance I'll get my purse back?
Maybe not your purse.
But I'll nab that guy some day!
Fill'em out.
I'll be back.
Interesting face!
The picture was taken at the party.
He should still be dressed like that.
OK, we'll hunt him down.
A man in a tux in the subway
is easy to spot.
It's vast. Even we get lost.
Your address and phone, pIease?
You didn't sign here.
Sorry.
If there's news, we'll be in touch.
If you see this joker, run him in.
Batman here Chief!
No sign of that guy. But the Skater's
right here. What do I do?
Follow the Skater.
Thanks, Chief.
- Robin, read me?
- Strength 5!
I need men in the Vincennes line
crossover.
I'm tailing the Skater.
I can spare 2 men, OK?
I need more.
I lost my antenna.
We've got him!
Spread out!
After him, move!
Shit!
He jumped over the...
Shit!
You miss the first guy,
then the second!
You're pathetic, Batman!
Flowers, miss?
I'll be 5 minutes.
How are you? Shall we have a drink?
I'm busy.
Don't say no, you'll upset me.
Give us 5 minutes.
There's never an opener.
You're well-equipped!
Nice suit. What's it made of?
Fox!
That's a good one!
It's a perfect fit, the right size.
What size would you say he is?
Medium.
- When did you buy it?
- This morning.
Is the seller still around?
Dunno... Is it important?
Would I be here otherwise?
What's he done?
Dumb things. You want details?
No, just asking. Being attentive.
That's good.
Got the Skater's address?
Ain't seen him in a week.
And your tailor's address?
Only met him once. We're not close.
All this is very annoying.
When I'm annoyed, I get testy.
The slightest thing sets me off.
I can even be unpleasant...
Overstep my authority...
It's terrible the violence dormant
in us all...
This violence...
blind, all-consuming...
The only way I can calm myself...
is to vent my rage...
on the first comer.
It's hard life, isn't it!
I don't know the guy.
He sold me his suit, that's all.
He's the Skater's pal.
Where's the Skater?
I dunno...Honest!
I'll find out, I'll do my best.
Good... And I'll do my best...
to keep my rage under control.
Want another?
You've had enough.
Pay me so I can close up.
- Sorry.
- Shit!
Can't you watch out?
I'm really sorry
Your nose is bleeding.
What the hell are you doing here?
I got lost.
You already asleep?
Here, meet... What's your name?
I'm Jean-Louis.
Want a drink... Scotch?
Thanks.
What do you do, Fred?
I'm forming a group... of musicians.
Interesting.
"The Blackmailers"?
You do vocals?
I can't sing.
I was in a car accident as a kid.
My dad was driving.
He bet his sedan could go
under a truck.
It did!
I was 5 hours on the operating table,
5 months in the hospital.
5 years unable to speak.
The accident was on my 5th birthday!
Weird, eh?
The law of numbers. 5 kept coming up.
Ever since, I've loved birthdays.
I'm leaving. You're a real downer!
Don't you go to the movies?
Sure...
So stick 'em up!
I'm glad to see you.
Me too, where are the papers?
- In my tuxedo.
- Where is it?
Upstairs, with my pal
who owns a music store.
Slip this on.
Put your arm around the crate.
You're queer for handcuffs!
I want those papers, sweetheart!
Getting familiar?
Did you buy my accident story?
No.
- You the owner?
- Yes.
Fred sent me.
The guy who left you his tux.
The blond...
He didn't leave me a thing!
Thanks Big Bill.
- Time you quit this crap!
- I know.
I don't get it...
You think it's funny?
Let's go for coffee.
You've got 3 seconds. One...
What a slum!
Put that toy away.
It's useless here.
You can't shoot a florist.
You're a mess! Look at that!
Grease stains!
Wear this. I'll have yours cleaned.
No, thanks.
You know Fred?
The blond guy who was here?
He's an old friend.
Known him for years.
Is he always like that?
What do you know about him?
Less than nothing.
Fabulous! No feelings,
no friends. Only a spark of passion...
You'll get along fine.
A bouquet?
What's she doing, goddamit!
It's closed. Beat it, move on,
everybody out!
What are you doing here?
Keeping the lady company.
My ass! Snitching my scotch
behind my back!
Your crummy scotch? No chance!
You two about through?
One in the tub at night
is good for your flowers.
But put them in head first.
Beat it!
He's delightful. I'll leave the bag
in case you have problems.
That prick drinks all my Liquors.
I can't even entertain!
I may just move out!
Where can we go for dinner?
I'm starving.
What're you waiting for?
Pick me up at the station bar
at 8 a.m.
Make it 9. See you tomorrow.
Go stare at my picture!
What are you cooking up?
Nothing.
Your eyes have changed color.
Don't you like it?
No.
Your face has changed color.
You're radiant!
You've lost interest in those papers.
Maybe I interest you?
You want me?
Well, you won't get me.
Shall we dance?
Why do I love you?
Because I'm a fabulous girl.
Why don't you love me?
I don't have the guts.
Are you lazy?
Very.
Who cooks at home?
The cook.
- Who does the house work?
- The maid.
Who makes love?
May I?
Hi, cats!
Shit, that's all we needed!
Who's she?
Cinderella.
Your Cinderella packs
a helluva pistol!
Her magic wand!
Can I have a coffee, please?
Your husband's waiting over there.
Couldn't resist bringing him, eh?
Slept well?
Where do I start?
At the beginning.
I met a guy...
- A croissant?
- No, thanks.
Piece of pie?
No, thanks.
We've got great desserts,
but no takers!
I met him in front of our house.
He helped me get my shopping
out of the car.
I liked him. So I invited him...
to my birthday party.
And he blew the safe during the party?
Yeah...
But he gave it all back a bit later.
Except that file.
He lost it.
We found this in the mail box.
"Get $50,000 in small bills...
if you want to recover your papers.
Further instruction follow".
Happy now?
I'm just a nobody you found,
Mr Moneybags!
You're smothering me, Mr Moneybags!
I need air!
I didn't cheat on you last night.
I didn't even feel like it.
I mostly watched fireworks.
It felt good.
I'm sick of your way of life.
Your schemes, your smiles.
I'm even sick of your money.
So why not divorce me?
What do I owe?
Take care of the young man. And fast.
We're dining out tonight.
Be ready by 8.
Smile now and then!
Smiling makes me want to puke!
- What's that hairdo?
- Iroquois!
- What?
- Iroquois!
How are you?
So nice to see you!
My goodness!
Come in, Raymond!
Business! You look well.
Been on the Riviera?
You're so right!
Good thing! It's been raining in Paris.
Can I take your coat?
No!
- Are you cold?
- No, but I won't stay long.
...she said, that antique-dealer's
a thief...
I said, maybe, but I need furniture...
She said, then try...
what's his name?... Baptiste...
I thought, now you're
on the right track.
So I go to old Baptiste...
What class you in?
Senior, my second repeat.
He wanted cash. What to do?
Awkward! Next day I went back...
Stop! Tell it to your neighbor!
I don't give a shit!
Dearest, what's going on?
Trouble, Mrs Kerman?
No. I simply told your wife
I don't give...
a shit about her asshole stories.
Helena apologize immediately!
Apologize? What for?
Being bored for 3 hours?
Trade places with me.
You'll see how dull it is.
Leave the table at once!
Mr V.I.P., your dinner party stinks,
your apartment stinks...
Fuck you all!
Want the boss?
He may not be back.
Tell me. I'm almost his right arm.
Know where Quimper is?
On the North coast.
And Saint Raphael?
I've heard of it. On the Riviera!
I lost my passport on the trip.
Between the Riviera and the North
coast?
Exactly! I know, it's not
your territory.
But the Lt spoke so well of you.
That so?... Well... I, er...
It's not going to be easy.
What kind of car were you in?
Flowers?
Do I look like I want flowers?
You look like you're waiting for
someone. It'll be a long wait.
How much?
2 bucks. Plus a brandy!
Bravo! René, a double brandy!
Lieutenant! This young lady...
lost her passport...
So, uh...
She was in a car and...
- 2 coffees.
- 2 coffees, right!
- Anything new?
- Yes.
$50,000! Better pay up now.
His price is rising fast!
Some men are looking for him...
To kill him.
It's like in a cowboy picture.
You're the sheriff...
It's better if you find him first.
Better for whom?
For everybody.
If you don't do something...
This'll be your Waterloo.
How many are after him?
About ten.
With luck, they'll miss him today.
And we close in 20 minutes.
Let's hope.
On your feet, you worms!
OK, spread out!
OK, stick together!
This is Paul, the singer.
OK, meet Jean-Claude,
on guitar, Emile...
on bongos...
The drummer, who's nameless...
Mr Saxophone!
And this little mite is Eric,
composer and bass player.
Sit down.
Chief, I found his hideout!
Look at these!
He's never here! What a pain!
You nuts?
Police... handcuffs... prison!
ID papers, please.
Papers!
Shit! Fuck it!
Block off all of level 2!
Robin here.
Seen anybody?
OK. Only one left!
Identity check!
OK, do your job!
- Patrol's been alerted.
- You're a pain!
Now we've lost him.
You can be a real pain!
Is he here?
Who?
The pope.
I don't know.
All I saw was the Lieutenant.
Horse's ass!
Batman! You're the one who gave me...
a nice pair of skates. Fine.
Now I've got 2!
I'm going to become a roller fiend.
Read these letters?
Answer the Lieutenant!
Mr Batman, be so kind...
as to fetch me a small coffee,
with a hint of milk and 2 sugars!
What a jerk!
I've got a weak nose.
Should've told him.
Pleased with yourself, huh?
It's easy to sneer now!
For 8 months you've sneered at us.
8 months he's been after you.
You can't blame him.
Where'd you get these?
Found them lying in a corridor.
In a corridor?
"Get $50,000 in small bills...
Further instructions follow.Fred."
I'm not Fred.
Me neither.
This is Lt. Gesberg.
Let me talk to Mrs Kerman.
How's things?
Didn't we say $1 ,000?
After I get my man!
I don't like it!
I don't like your face.
Take it easy!
Don't get mad for $500!
See that phone?
It's 6 p.m. Pick it up at exactly 7:15.
You'll have his address.
Darling boy!
Asshole!
I have to phone The shades!
- Again ?
- Yes, again!
Fifty-fifty!
One of us should shed his shades.
Don't move!
Got any kids?
Your wife work too?
Shut the doors!
Beat it!
You blew $500!
Hi, pal!
Damn him!
We'll be late!
Where we playing?
We could go on ahead.
I don't know where.
Don't worry. He'll be here.
There he is!
Sorry kiddies!
You really scared us!
Yeah, I'm sorry.
So where we going?
Nowhere. This is it.
You putting us on?
This is a hall?
Let's get set up.
This equipment stinks!
Thanks, Lieutenant.
There's been a stick-up
on the suburban line.
Well?
Well, nothing.
What are you waiting for?
OK, I'm going!
So go!
I'm gone!
What will you do about Fred?
That Fred gets on my nerves!
So look for him, find him,
tell him to take a walk! Do him good!
On that stick-up :
I'm on the platform...
I'll try to trace them...
Use some initiative, Batman.
Sent a riot squad into the tunnel.
See what happens!
Thanks, chief.
We're not through!
Fill this out: name, first name, etc.
Objects lost and recovered,
and sign it.
Where are the others,
the bass player, Paul?
In the anteroom.
Weren't you told?
What?
Concert's canceled
Didn't the subway staff inform you?
Where's Mr Lemoine?
This is the second time!
We'll play for free,
but there are limits!
That's what I said to Mr Lemoine...
Here, for your trouble.
Please forgive us.
Where's Mr Lemoine?
Wise up!
Today just listen.
Tomorrow you get to play!
That OK?
Wait.
Can I pay by check?
No problem.
Give it all you got!
Can I ask you a question?
Do you love me a little?
I'll call you later.
