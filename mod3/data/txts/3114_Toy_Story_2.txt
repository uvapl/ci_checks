Buzz Lightyear mission log.
All signs point to this planet
as the location of Zurg's fortress,
but there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.
Come to me, my prey.
To infinity and beyond!
So, we meet again,
Buzz Lightyear, for the last time.
Not today, Zurg!
-No, no, no, no.
-Oh, you almost had him.
-I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
-Sure, you will, Rex.
ln fact, you're a better Buzz than I am.
But look at my little arms!
l can't press the "fire" button
and jump at the same time!
Where is it? Where is it?
Woody?
Hang on, cowboy!
-Woody, are you all right?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your
list of things to do while I'm gone.
Batteries need to be changed.
Toys in the bottom of the chest
need to be rotated.
Oh, and make sure everyone
attends Mr. SpelI's seminar
on what to do
if you or a part of you is swallowed.
Okay? Okay. Good. Okay.
Woody, you haven't found
your hat yet, have you?
No! And Andy's leaving
for cowboy camp any minute,
and I can't find it anywhere!
Don't worry, Woody.
ln just a few hours,
you'll be sitting around a campfire with
Andy making delicious, hot "sch'moes."
-They're called s'mores, Buzz.
-Right. Right. Of course.
Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?
Keep looking, men.
Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching.
The lawn gnome next door says it's not
in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'.
It's not in Molly's room.
We've looked everywhere.
-l found it.
-You found my hat?
Your hat? No.
The missus lost her earring.
-Oh, my little sweet potato!
-Oh, you found it!
Oh, it's so nice
to have a big, strong spud
around the house.
Oh, great. That's just great.
This'll be the first year I miss cowboy
camp, all because of my stupid hat!
-Woody, look under your boot.
-Don't be silly.
-My hat is not under my boot.
-Would you just look?
No hat. Just the word "Andy."
And the boy who wrote that
would take you to camp
with or without your hat.
I'm sorry, Bo.
It's just that I've been
lookin' forward to this all year.
It's my one time with just me and Andy.
You're cute when you care.
-Bo, not in front of Buzz.
-Let him look.
Miss Peep, your sheep!
<i>This is Al from AI's Toy Barn,</i>
<i>-and I'm sittin' on good deaIs.
-Whoa!</i>
<i>I think I'm feeling
a deal hatching right now.</i>
<i>Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got
boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck...</i>
-Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!
-Which one is off?
<i>Buck, buck, buck!
And that's cheap, cheap, cheap!</i>
<i>So hurry on down...</i>
For cryin' out loud, it's this one.
-l despise that chicken.
-Fellas! Fellas!
Okay, I got some good news,
and I got some bad news.
What news?
The good news is
l found your hat, Woody.
My hat! Slink, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-Where'd you find it?
-Well, that's the bad news.
Oh, it's Buster!
Canine alert! Man your battle stations!
Let's move, move, move!
Woody! Hide! Quick!
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay! You found me!
Buster, all right.
Hey, how did he do, Hamm?
-Looks like a new record.
-Okay, boy. Sit.
Reach for the sky.
Gotcha!
Great job, boy.
Who's gonna miss me
while I'm gone, huh?
Who's gonna miss me?
Andy, you got all your stuff?
Have a good weekend, everybody.
I'll see you Sunday night.
It's in my room.
Stick 'em up.
l guess we'll work on that later.
Hey, Woody.
Ready to go to cowboy camp?
Andy, honey, come on.
Five minutes, and we're leavin'.
Five minutes.
Help, help! Somebody help me!
Let her go, evil Dr Pork Chop!
Never!
You must choose, Sheriff Woody.
How shall she die?
Shark, or death by monkeys?
Choose!
l choose Buzz Lightyear!
What? That's not a choice!
To infinity and beyond!
-I'll save you, Miss Peep.
-My hero.
-Thanks, Buzz.
-No problem, buddy.
You should never tangle
with the unstoppable duo
of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, no.
Andy, let's go!
Molly's already in her car seat.
-But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped.
-Oh, no.
-Maybe we can fix him on the way.
-No, just leave him.
I'm sorry, honey,
but you know toys don't last forever.
-What happened?
-Woody's been shelved.
Andy!
-Woody?
-Woody? Honey, are you okay?
Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!
He's back?
Hey, everybody! Andy's back!
He's back early from cowboy camp!
Places, everybody! Andy's coming!
Yeah!
Hey, Woody! Did you miss me?
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap.
Ride 'em, cowboy!
l forgot. You're broken.
l don't wanna play with you any more.
No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No!
Andy. Andy.
Bye, Woody.
No! No! Andy!
Wheezy, is that you?
-Hey, Woody.
-What are you doing up here?
l thought Mom took you
to get your squeaker fixed months ago.
-Andy was so upset.
-Nah.
She just told him that
to calm him down
and then put me on the sheIf.
-Why didn't you yell for help?
-Well, I tried squeakin'.
But I'm still broken.
No one could hear me.
Besides, the dust
aggravates my condition.
What's the point
in prolonging the inevitable?
We're all just one stitch away
from here to there.
Yard sale? Yard sale!
Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up!
There's a yard sale outside!
-Yard sale?
-Sarge, emergency roll call!
Sir, yes, sir! Red alert!
All civilians fall in position now!
Single file! Let's move, move, move!
-Hamm?
-Here.
-Potato Head, Mr. and Mrs.?
-Here.
Troikas. Check,
check, check, check, check.
l hate yard sales!
Someone's coming!
Okay. Let's see what's up here.
Bye, Woody.
Wheezy! Think, think, Woody.
Think, think, think.
Hey. Here, boy. Here, Buster!
Up here! No, no, no, no, no, no!
Okay, boy. To the yard sale!
What's goin' on? He's nuts.
His arm ain't that bad.
Don't do it, Woody! We love you!
Careful on the steps, now.
Okay, boy. Let's go.
And keep it casual.
Not that casual.
Piggy bank coming through,
coming through.
-Is he out there?
-There he is.
He's getting in the box!
He's sellin' himseIf for 25 cents!
Woody, you're worth more than that.
Hold on. Hold on. He's got something.
-It's Wheezy!
-Wheezy?
Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue.
Good boy, Buster. Hold still.
There. There you go, pal.
-Bless you, Woody.
-All right, now.
Back to Andy's room.
Way to go, cowboy.
-Golly bob howdy!
-Woody, I'm slipping!
Mommy... Mommy, look! Look at this!
-Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!
-Hey, that's not her toy!
What's that little gal think she's doin'?
Mommy, Mommy, can we get it?
Please? Mommy, please?
Oh, honey. You don't want
that toy. It's broken.
<i>There's a snake in my boot.</i>
Original hand-painted face.
Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest!
Little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had
your hand-stitched, polyvinyl...
A hat!
l found him! I found him! I found him!
Buster! Quiet down!
-Excuse me. Can I help you?
-Yes.
You can help take his paws off my pal.
I'll give you 50 cents for all this junk.
-Oh, now, how did this get down here?
-Hand her the sheriff.
Nice and easy.
-$5.
-I'm sorry. It's an old family toy.
Now just walk away.
-Wait.
-The other way.
-I'll give you 50 bucks for it.
-50 bucks ain't bad.
-It's not for sale.
-Everything's for sale.
-Or trade. You like my watch?
-Sorry.
-He's safe. Way to go Andy's mom!
-She showed him!
Molly, don't touch that, sweetie.
Yeah. Go home, Mr. Fancy Car.
-Hold on.
-What's up?
What is it, Buzz?
What's happening?
What's he doing?
l can't watch!
Can someone cover my eyes?
-He's stealin' Woody!
-What? He can't take Woody.
It's illegal.
-Where's he going?
-Do something.
Buzz!
Get him, Buzz.
Where's the red jacket?
Why would someone steal Woody?
All right.
Let's review this one more time.
At precisely 8:32-ish,
Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped.
Exhibit B,
a composite sketch of the kidnapper.
-He didn't have a beard like that.
-Fine. Etch, give him a shave.
The kidnapper was bigger than that.
-Oh, picky, picky, picky.
-Let's just go straight to Exhibit F.
The kidnapper's vehicle.
Now, the vehicle fled the scene
in this direction.
Your eyes are in backwards.
It went the other way.
Hey. Put a cork in it.
-How do you spell FBl?
-My crime scene!
Oh, why don't you watch
where you're going, Godspilla?
-l didn't know there was a crime scene.
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
A little quiet, please. Thank you.
<i>Lazy toy brain.</i>
<i>-Lousy try, Brian.
-What are you doing, Buzz?</i>
It's some sort of message
encoded on that vehicle's l.D. tag.
<i>-Liz try bran.
-It's just a licence plate.</i>
-It's just a jumble of letters.
-Yeah, and there are about
3.5 million registered cars
in the tri-county area alone.
<i>Lou's thigh burn.</i>
Oh, this can't help.
Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys.
Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on!
<i>-AI's Toy Barn.
-AI's Toy Barn!</i>
Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit.
It's the chicken man!
That's our guy.
l knew there was something
l didn't like about that chicken.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there.
And we're gonna do this commercial
in one take, do you hear me,
because I am in the middle
of something really important.
You, my little cowboy friend,
are gonna make me
big buck, buck, bucks.
Andy!
l can't believe I have to drive
all the way to work on a Saturday.
All the way to work!
What? Whoa!
Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy!
Stop it! Sit, I said!
Whoa! Whoa.
Yee-haw!
It's you! It's you!
It's you! It's you! It's you!
-It's really you!
-What's me?
<i>There's a snake in my boot.</i>
-It is you!
-Please stop saying that.
Prospector said someday you'd come.
Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln!
The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya!
Say "hello" to the Prospector!
-It... It's a box.
-He's mint in the box.
Never been opened.
Turn me around, BulIseye,
so I can see.
Why, the prodigal son has returned.
Yee-haw!
It's you! It's you!
You're here! It's you! It's you! It's you!
Okay. I'm officially freaked-out now.
Oh, we've waited countless years
for this day.
-It's good to see you, Woody.
-Listen. I don't know...
-Hey, how do you know my name?
-Everyone knows your name, Wood-y.
Why, you don't know
who you are, do you? BulIseye?
That's me.
Wow.
Holy cow.
<i>Cowboy Crunchies,</i>

Woody's Roundup
l can't find it! It doesn't seem
to be on any of these stations.
-Keep looking.
-You're going too slow.
Let me take the wheel.
It's too fast.
-How can you even tell what's on?
-l can tell.
Stop! Back, back, back!
Too late. I'm in the 40s.
Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster.
<i>-Back, back! Stop!
-And look for the giant chicken!</i>
Now, Etch!
That's where I need to go.
You can't go, Buzz.
You'll never make it there.
Woody once risked his life to save me.
l couldn't call myseIf his friend
if I weren't willing to do the same.
So who's with me?
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.
This is for Woody when you find him.
All right,
but I don't think it'll mean
the same coming from me.
Mr. Buzz Lightyear,
you just gotta save my pal Woody.
I'll do my best, son.
Okay, fellas. Let's roll.
Geronimo!
You'd think with
all my video game experience,
I'd be feeling more prepared.
The idea is to let go.
We'll be back before Andy gets home.
Don't talk to any toy you don't know!
To AI's Toy Barn and beyond!
<i>They don't call this</i>
<i>the old abandoned mine
for nothin', Prospector.</i>
<i>I reckon we oughta get outta here.</i>
<i>Where's my gold?
Hold on. I'll light me a candle.</i>
<i>This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.</i>
<i>Blast us to smithereens!
That there's dynamite!</i>
<i>-Holy tarnation.
-I'll call for help.</i>
<i>Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody.
Now scurry!</i>
<i>Good job, BulIseye.</i>
<i>I reckon the new schoolhouse
is finally done.</i>
<i>What's that?</i>
<i>Jessie and Prospector are trapped
in the old abandoned mine,</i>
<i>and Prospectorjust lit a stick
of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle,</i>
<i>and now they're about
to be blown to smithereens?</i>
<i>Ride like the wind, BulIseye!</i>
<i>You're fannin' the flames, Jessie!
It takes brains to put out that fire.</i>
<i>My biscuits are burnin'!</i>
<i>Will Woody
and BulIseye land to safety?</i>
<i>Can they reach Jessie
and Stinky Pete in time?</i>
<i>Tune in next week for the exciting
conclusion, "Woody's Finest Hour."</i>
All right! All right! Next tape!
Hey, wait.
What happened? What happens next?
-Come on! Let's see the next episode!
-That's it.
-What?
-The show was cancelled after that.
Wait. What about the gold mine and
the cute little critters and the dynamite?
That was a great show!
l mean, why cancel it?
Two words, Sput-nik.
Once the astronauts went up, children
only wanted to play with space toys.
l know how that feeIs.
But, still, my own show.
-l mean, look at all this stuff!
-Didn't you know?
Why, you're valuable property!
l wish the guys could see this.
Hey-howdy-hey. That's me.
I'm on a yo-yo.
Oh, hey. Nice teeth.
And yet still a good-lookin' guy.
Oh, it's a bank! Cool.
What do you do?
You push the hat, and out...
Oh, out come bubbles. Clever.
Oh, wow. Hey, what's this thing do?
l get it.
"There's a snake in my boot."
Oh, hey, BulIseye. Go long! Go long!
A record player!
l haven't seen one of these in ages.
Okay, now. Slow.
Oh, that's funny, BulIseye.
Hop on, cowgirl! Think fast!
Not bad.
It's time forWoody's Roundup
<i>He's the very best</i>
<i>He's the rootin'-est
tootin'-est cowboy...</i>
Look at us! We're a complete set!
-Now it's on to the museum.
-Museum?
-What museum?
-THE museum.
We're being sold
to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo.
-That's in Japan!
-Japan?
No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan.
What do you mean?
l got to get back home to
my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See?
-He still has an owner.
-Oh, my goodness.
No. Can't go.
l can't do storage again. I just can't!
-Jessie. Jessie.
-l won't go back in the dark!
What's the matter?
What's wrong with her?
Well, we've been in storage
for a long time
waiting for you.
-Why me?
-The museum's
only interested in the collection
if you're in it, Woody.
Without you, we go back into storage.
-It's that simple.
-It's not fair!
How can you do this to us?
Hey, look. I'm sorry,
but this is all a big mistake.
-You see, I was in this yard sale...
-Yard sale?
Why were you in a yard sale
if you have an owner?
Well, I wasn't supposed to be there.
l was trying to save another toy when...
Was it because you're damaged?
Did this Andy break you?
Yeah, but... No, no, no, no, no!
It was... It was an accident.
-l mean...
-Sounds like he really loves you.
It's not like that, okay?
And I'm not going to any museum!
Well, I'm not going back into storage!
AI's coming!
Go! Go on, Jessie.
Jessie, look at me.
l promise you'll come out of the box.
Now go! Go!
It's show time!
Oh, money, baby.
Money, money, money.
And now
the main attraction.
No! His arm! Where's his arm?
No. No, no, no, no!
What am I gonna do? I know. I know.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Pick up the phone!
<i>-Hello?
-It's me. It's Al.</i>
l got an emergency.
<i>-I'm busy.
-Yes, we're all busy.</i>
Look. It has to be tonight.
All right. All right.
But first thing in the morning.
It's gone! I can't believe it!
-My arm is completely gone!
-All right. Come here. Let me see that.
Oh, it's just a popped seam,
easily repaired.
-You should consider yourseIf lucky.
-Lucky?
Are you shrink-wrapped?
l am missing my arm!
Big deal.
Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy
is dying to play with
a one-armed cowboy doll.
Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last
an hour on the streets in his condition.
It's a dangerous world
out there for a toy.
All right.
Nobody look till I get my cork back in.
Good work, men. Two blocks down
and only 19 more to go.
-What?
-Nineteen?
Are we gonna do this all night?
My parts are killing me.
Come on, fellas.
Did Woody give up when Sid
had me strapped to a rocket?
-No.
-No.
And did he give up when you threw him
out of the back of that moving van?
-Oh, you had to bring that up.
-No, he didn't!
We have a friend in need, and we will
not rest until he's safe in Andy's room!
Now let's move out!
<i>And that concludes
our broadcast day.</i>
BulIseye. BulIseye, go, go, go, go.
Come on. You don't wanna
help me. I'm the bad guy.
You're gonna go back in storage
because of me, remember? Just go.
BulIseye... All right. All right.
But you have got
to keep quiet. Come on.
Over here. Attaboy.
Okay, BulIseye. Upsy-daisy.
BulIseye. Cut it out.
Stop it.
Stop it, BulIseye. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.
<i>Woody's Roundup
Come on, it's time to play</i>
No, Officer! I swear. What?
Get in there.
There you go. Cheap case.
Where is the remote?
Why don't I put it in the same place
every... Oh, here it is.
What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry
l can't help you guys out.
Really, I am. But you didn't have
to go and pull a stunt like that.
What? You think I did that?
Oh, right, right.
The TV just happened to turn on,
and the remote magically ended up
in front of you!
-You calling me a liar?
-Well, if the boot fits...
Say that again.
If the boot fits.
Okay, cowboy.
How do you like that?
Take it back! Take it back!
Don't think just 'cause you're a girl,
I'm gonna take it easy on you.
Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once.
l don't know
how that television turned on,
but fighting about it
isn't helping anything.
-If I had both my arms...
-The fact is, you don't, Woody,
so I suggest
you just wait until morning.
-The cleaner will come, fix your arm...
And then I'm outta here!
Oh, no, no.
BulIseye, don't take it that way.
-It's just that Andy...
-Andy, Andy, Andy.
That's all he ever talks about.
Hey, Buzz, can we slow down?
May I remind you that some of us are
carrying over $6 in change?
Losing heaIth units. Must rest.
Is everyone present and accounted for?
Not quite everyone.
-Who's behind?
-Mine.
Hey, guys.
Why do the toys cross the road?
-Not now, Hamm.
-Oh, I love riddles. Why?
To get to the chicken
on the other side!
The chicken!
-Oh, well. We tried.
-We'll have to cross.
What the...
You're not turning me
into a mashed potato.
l may not be a smart dog,
but I know what roadkill is.
There must be a safe way.
Okay.
Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go.
Drop!
Go!
Drop! I said "drop"!
Go!
Drop.
Go.
That went well.
Good job, troops.
We're that much closer to Woody.
Oh, thank goodness you're here.
Is the specimen ready for cleaning?
So, how long is this gonna take?
You can't rush art.
Oh, no. It's closed.
We're not preschool toys, Slinky.
We can read.
Hey, Joe, you're late.
We've got a ton of toys to unload.
All right. All right.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.
All right. Let's go.
But the sign says it's closed.
No, no, no, no. All together. Now!
Whoa, Nelly! How are we going
to find Woody in this place?
Look for Al. We find Al,
we find Woody. Now move out!
-Woody?
-Woody.
There you go.
He's for display only.
You handle him too much,
he's not gonna last.
It's amazing. You're a genius.
He's just like new.
Wow.
l could use one of those.
You know, they make it so you can't
defeat Zurg unless you buy this book.
It's extortion. That's what it is.
Hey, I always thought
the golden sector was the only...
l thought we could search in style.
Nice going there, Hamm. So how about
letting a toy with fingers drive?
Am I really that fat?
-What are you doing?
-You're in direct violation
of Code 6404.5,
stating all Space Rangers
are to be in hyper-sleep
until awakened
by authorised personnel.
Oh, no.
You're breakin' ranks, Ranger.
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
-I've got an AWOL Space Ranger.
-Tell me I wasn't this deluded.
No back talk!
l have a laser, and I will use it.
Mean the laser that's a light bulb?
Has your mind been melded?
You could've killed me, Space Ranger.
Or should I say "traitor"?
-l don't have time for this.
-HaIt!
l order you to haIt!
Listen to me. Listen. Wait.
-We've been down this aisle already.
-We've never been down this aisle.
-It's pink.
-Face it. We're lost.
Back it up. Back it up.
What a great party!
How low can you go?
How low can you go?
Excuse me, ladies.
Does anyone know where we might
find the Al of AI's Toy Barn?
l can help.
I'm Tour Guide Barbie.
Please keep your hands, arms
and accessories inside the car,
and no flash photography.
-Thank you.
-I'm a married spud.
-I'm a married spud.
-Then make room for the single fellas.
To our right is the Hot WheeIs aisle.
Developed in 1967,
the original series had 16 cars,
including the Corvette.
l beg your pardon, ma'am,
but where's AI's office?
Please hold all questions
until the end of the tour. Thank you.
It says how you defeat Zurg! Look!
-Excuse me, sir.
-Get this outta here, geekosaur.
-Look out!
-Stop, stop, stop!
Turn into the spin, Barbie!
My source of power!
No! Come back! Hey!
Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down!
Dinosaur overboard! Slow down!
Remain seated, please.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not really a Space Ranger.
You're a toy.
We're all toys. Do you hear me?
Well, that should hold you
till the court martial.
Let me go! You don't realise
what you're doing!
And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle.
ln 1995, shortsighted retailers did not
order enough dolIs to meet demand.
-Hey, Buzz!
-HaIt! Who goes there?
Quit clownin' around
and get in the car!
Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg!
-You do?
-Come on. I'll tell you on the way.
No, no, guys! You've got the wrong
Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz!
Say, where'd you get
the cool beIt, Buzz?
Well, slotted pig,
they're standard issue.
No!
It's like printing my own money.
Yeah? What?
Mr. Konishi.
Yes, I have the pictures right here.
ln fact, I'm in the car right now on
my way to the office to fax them to you.
I'm going through a tunnel!
I'm breakin' up!
Oh, wow! Will you look at me?
It's like I'm fresh out of the box!
Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna
have a hard time rippin' this! Hello!
Hi! Hello!
Great. Now you can go.
Well, what a good idea.
Woody, don't be mad at Jessie.
She's been through
more than you know.
Why not make amends
before you leave, huh?
It's the least you can do.
All right.
But I don't know what good it'll do.
Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?
Thought I'd get one last look at the
sun before I get packed away again.
Look, Jessie.
l know you hate me for leaving,
but I have to go back.
I'm still Andy's toy.
Well, if you knew him,
you'd understand. Andy's a real...
Let me guess.
Andy's a real special kid.
And to him, you're his buddy,
his best friend.
And when Andy plays with you,
it's like even though you're not moving,
you feel like you're alive,
because that's how he sees you.
How did you know that?
Because Emily was just the same.
She was my whole world.
<i>When somebody loved me</i>
<i>Everything was beautiful</i>
<i>Every hour we spent together</i>
<i>Lives within my heart</i>
<i>And when she was sad</i>
<i>I was there to dry her tears</i>
<i>And when she was happy, so was I</i>
<i>When she loved me</i>
<i>Through the Summer and the Fall</i>
<i>We had each other
That was all</i>
<i>Just she and I together</i>
<i>Like it was meant to be</i>
<i>And when she was lonely</i>
<i>I was there to comfort her</i>
<i>And I knew that</i>
<i>She loved me</i>
<i>So the years went by</i>
<i>I stayed the same</i>
<i>But she began to drift away</i>
<i>I was left alone</i>
<i>Still I waited for the day</i>
<i>When she'd say</i>
<i>I will always love you</i>
<i>Lonely and forgotten</i>
<i>I never thought she'd look my way</i>
<i>She smiled at me and held me</i>
<i>Just like she used to do</i>
<i>Like she loved me</i>
<i>When she loved me</i>
<i>When somebody loved me</i>
<i>Everything was beautiful</i>
<i>Every hour we spent together</i>
<i>Lives within my heart</i>
<i>When she loved me</i>
You never forget kids
like Emily or Andy.
But they forget you.
-Jessie, I didn't know.
-Just go.
How long will it last, Woody?
Do you really think
Andy is gonna take you to college
or on his honeymoon?
Andy's growing up,
and there's nothing you can do about it.
It's your choice, Woody.
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.
You'll be adored
by children for generations.
Who am I to break up
the Roundup gang?
-Hey, Woody, are you in here?
-Nah. This one's empty too.
-Woody! Woody!
-Woody!
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but have either of you seen
a cowboy doll with a bad arm?
-Why, no, I haven't.
-Hey! He was talkin' to me!
-No! He was talkin' to me!
-Why, you...
You see, all along,
we thought the way into Zurg's fortress
was through the main gate,
but in fact the secret entrance is
to the left, hidden in the shadows.
To the left in the shadows. Got it.
-Someone's coming.
-Everyone, take cover.
It was a big pile-up, but I don't want
to bore you with the detaiIs.
Yes. Now, let me confirm
your fax number.
<i>-011 ...
-011 . Wait.</i>
That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it.
-It's him.
-The chicken man.
Funny, he doesn't look like pouItry.
That's the kidnapper, all right.
A kidnapper!
An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one.
And the pièce de résistance!
l promise the collection will be
the crown jewel of your museum.
-It's Woody!
-Now that I have your attention,
imagine we added
another zero to the price, huh?
<i>-I'll pay anything you want.
-Yes! Yes!</i>
You got a deal!
I'll be on the next flight to Japan!
Quick.
lnto the pouItry man's cargo unit.
He'll lead us to Zurg.
Move, move, move!
Don't touch my moustache!
Rich, rich, rich, rich!
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
Destroy Buzz Lightyear.
-He didn't take the bag!
-No time to lose!
He's ascending
in the vertical transporter.
All right, everyone. Hang on.
We're gonna blast through the roof.
-Buzz?
-To infinity and beyond!
What are you? lnsane? We're
wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla.
l don't understand.
Somehow my fuel celIs have gone dry.
Blast. He's on level 23.
How are we gonna get up there?
Maybe if we find some balloons,
we could float to the top.
Are you kidding?
l say we stack ourselves up,
push the intercom
and pretend we're delivering a pizza.
How about a ham sandwich
with fries and a hot dog?
What about me?
You can be the toy
that comes with the meal.
Troops! Over here.
Just like you said, lizard man.
"ln the shadows to the left."
Okay. Let's move!
Mission log. Have infiItrated
enemy territory without detection
and are making our way
through the boweIs of Zurg's fortress.
You know, I think that Buzz aisle
went to his head.
Oh, no. Which way do we go?
-This way!
-What makes you so sure?
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure.
We've been detected. The walIs!
They're closing in! Quick!
Help me prop up vegetable man,
or we're done for.
Hey! Put me down, you moron!
Guys, look! It's not the walIs!
It's the elevator!
Come on. We've got no time to lose.
Everyone, grab hold!
What?
Buzz, why not just take the elevator?
They'll be expecting that.
Hey, Buzz! Stop!
Slow down!
To overnight six packages
to Japan is how much?
That's in yen, right?
Dollars?
You are deliberately taking advantage
of people in a hurry, you know that?
All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine.
I'll have the stuff in the lobby,
and you'd better be here in 15 minutes,
because I have a plane
to catch, do you hear me?
We're finally going.
Can you believe it?
That's custom-fitted
foam insulation
you'll be riding in, BulIseye.
First class all the way!
You know what?
I'm actually excited about this.
l mean it. I really am!
-And why shouldn't you be?
-Yee-haw!
<i>Swing your partner do-si-do</i>
-Look at you, dancing cowboy!
-Look! I'm doin' the box step!
Hey, heads up down there!
-Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'.
-Hey, how much farther, Buzz?
HaIfway there.
My arms can't hold on much longer!
Too heavy.
What was I thinking?
My antigravity servos!
Hang tight, everyone.
I'm going to let go of the wall.
-What?
-He wouldn't.
-One...
-He would.
Two...
Three!
To infinity and beyond!
Approaching destination.
Reengaging gravity.
Area secure.
It's okay, troops.
The antigravity sickness will wear off
momentarily. Now let's move!
Remind me to glue his helmet shut
when we get back.
How 'bout givin' me
a little intro there, Jessie?
lntroducing the high-ridin'-est
cowboy around...
You forgot "rootin'-tootin'-est"!
The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est
cowboy hero of all time,
Sheriff Woody!
Say, little missy, you notice
any trouble around these parts?
Nary a bit,
not with Sheriff Woody around.
Wait, wait, wait! I got it!
This is great! Okay!
The bandits got the critters tied up
in the burning barn. Now the best part!
Help us! The barn's on fire!
I've got ya, critters. No need to worry.
Woody saves the day again!
Yee-haw!
Now, where's my trusty steed BulIseye?
l have to ride off into the sunset...
Ride like the wind, BulIseye!
Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay?
Oh, you are?
No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it.
No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop!
Mission log. Have reached
Zurg's command deck,
but no sign of him
or his wooden captive.
-Please, no!
-That's Woody!
This way!
Please, please, no!
Buzz, can you see? What's going on?
-Take that!
-To the left.
No, your left.
-Take it up higher.
-What's happening?
Oh, it's horrible.
They... They're torturing him.
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!
But I don't wanna use my head!
What's going on here?
Buzz, guys!
Hey, how did you find me?
Watch yourseIf!
We're here to spring ya, Woody!
You heard of kung fu?
Well, get ready for pork chop.
Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes!
Hold it, now!
Hey, you don't understand!
These are my friends!
-Yeah, we're his friends!
-No, Rex, I mean they're my friends!
Hey, stop it!
Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey!
-Grab Woody, and let's go!
-Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down!
-Quick! To the vent!
-They're stealing him.
No!
Hold it right there!
-Buzz?
-You again?
-Thank goodness you're all right.
-Buzz, what is going on?
Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear,
and I'm in charge of this detachment.
No, I'm Buzz Lightyear.
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!
-I'm Buzz Lightyear!
So, who's the real Buzz?
-l am!
-Don't let this impostor fool you!
He's been trained by Zurg himseIf
to mimic my every move.
Buzz!
l had a feelin' it was you.
My front end just had
to catch up with my back end.
Will somebody please
explain what's going on?
It's all right, Space Ranger.
It's a code 546.
-You mean it's a...
-Yes.
And he's a...
-Oh, yeah.
Your Majesty.
Woody, you're in danger here.
We need to leave now.
AI's selling you to a toy museum
-in Japan!
-l know.
It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go.
-What?
-Are you crazy?
Look, the thing is,
I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll,
and these guys are my Roundup gang.
<i>-What are you talking about?
-Woody's Roundup!</i>
Oh, it's this great old TV show,
and I was the star. See? Now look.
Look! Look at me! See? That's me!
-This is weirdin' me out.
-Buzz, it was a national phenomenon.
There was all this merchandise
that got packed up.
You should have seen it.
There was a record player and a yo-yo.
Buzz, I was a yo-yo!
-"Was"?
-Stop this nonsense and let's go.
Nah, Buzz.
l can't go. I can't abandon these guys.
They need me to get into this museum.
Without me, they'll go back
into storage. Maybe forever!
Woody, you're not a collector's item.
You're a child's plaything.
You are a toy!
For how much longer? One more rip,
and Andy's done with me.
And what do I do then, Buzz?
You tell me.
Somewhere in that pad of stuffing
is a toy who taught me
that life's only worth living
if you're bein' loved by a kid.
And I travelled all this way
to rescue that toy
because I believed him.
Well, you wasted your time.
-Let's go, everyone.
-What about Woody?
He's not coming with us.
But... But Andy's coming home tonight.
Then we'd better make sure
we're there waiting for him.
l don't have a choice, Buzz.
This is my only chance.
To do what, Woody?
Watch kids from behind glass
and never be loved again?
Some life.
<i>-Is everybody okay?
-Sheriff Woody!</i>
<i>-I knew you'd make it!
-Now, remember, deputies,</i>
<i>the real treasures are
your friends and family.</i>
<i>Before I go, kids, I want to share
somethin' special with you,</i>
<i>-for the times I'm not around.
-Good going, Woody!</i>
l thought they'd never leave.
<i>You've got a friend in me</i>
Woody?
<i>You've got troubles</i>
<i>Well, I've got 'em too</i>
<i>There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you</i>
<i>We stick together
and see it through</i>
<i>'Cause you've got a friend in me</i>
<i>Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am</i>
<i>Bigger and stronger too
Maybe</i>
<i>But none of them will ever love you</i>
<i>The way I do
It's me and you, boy</i>
<i>And as the years go by</i>
<i>Our friendship will never die</i>
<i>You're gonna see it's our destiny</i>
What am I doing?
-Buzz! Wait! Wait!
-Woody, where are you going?
You're right, Prospector.
l can't stop Andy from growing up.
But I wouldn't miss it for the world.
-No!
-Buzz!
-Yes?
-Yes?
I'm coming with you!
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll be back in just a second.
Way to go, cowboy!
-Hey, you guys... Come with me.
-What?
Andy will play with all of us. I know it!
Woody, I don't know. l...
Wouldn't you give anything
just to have one more day with Emily?
Come on, Jessie. This is what
it's all about, to make a child happy.
And you know it.
BulIseye, are you with me?
Okay, good boy.
Prospector, how 'bout you?
-Prospector?
-You're outta your box!
l tried reasoning with you, Woody,
but you keep forcing me
to take extreme measures.
Wait a minute. You turned on the TV
last night, not Jessie.
Look, we have an eternity
to spend together in the museum.
Let's not start off
by pointing fingers, shall we?
You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you?
Prospector, this isn't fair.
"Fair"? I'll tell you what's not fair.
Spending a lifetime on a dime-store
sheIf watching every other toy be sold.
Well, finally my waiting has paid off,
and no hand-me-down cowboy doll
is gonna mess it up for me now!
Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys!
It's too late, Woody. That silly
Buzz Lightweight can't help you.
His name is Buzz Lightyear.
Whatever. I've always hated
those upstart space toys.
It's stuck! What do we do?
Should I use my head?
It's Al!
Look at the time. I'm gonna be late!
Figures. I can't miss this flight!
I've gotta pack.
All right. Let's see.
Wallet, keys, tickets,
passport, beefjerky,
very expensive over there.
Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower.
l just gotta get outta here now!
Quick! To the elevator!
Hurry. I can hear it coming.
So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear,
for the last time.
It's Zurg! Watch out!
He's got an ion blaster!
Quick! Get on!
The emergency hatch! Come on!
-Come on! Hurry!
-But Buzz is in peril!
<i>Buzz Buzz Buzz...</i>
Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.
I'll never give in. You killed my father!
No, Buzz. I AM your father.
No!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Buzz, you could have
defeated Zurg all along!
You just need to believe in yourseIf!
-Prepare to die!
-l can't look!
Whoa!
l did it. I finally defeated Zurg!
Father.
Finally!
How are we gonna get him now?
Pizza, anyone?
-Go, go, go!
-l got it!
Buzz, are you coming?
No, I have a lot of
catching up to do with my dad.
Good throw, son.
That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!
-Oh, you're a great dad.
-Farewell.
Does anyone know how to drive?
Slink, take the pedaIs.
Rex, you navigate.
Hamm and Potato,
operate the levers and knobs.
Whoa.
-Strangers.
-From the outside.
-Oh, no.
-He's at a red light! We can catch him!
Maximum power, Slink!
It turned green! Hurry!
-Why won't it go?
-Use the Wand of Power.
-Rex, which way?
-Left! No, no! I mean right!
That's right! No, I mean left!
Left is right!
Buzz, he's turning left! He's turning left!
Oh, boy!
Whoa!
Oh, I seriously doubt
he's gettin' this kind of mileage.
Go right! To the right!
Right, right, right, right!
Whoa!
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
<i>The white zone is
for immediate loading and unloading...</i>
<i>No parking.</i>
Guys, we can't park here!
It's a white zone!
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.
<i>-Final boarding call...
-There he is!</i>
<i>...for Far East Airlines
flight 451 to Tokyo.</i>
<i>All confirmed passengers
with boarding passes</i>
<i>must board at this time.</i>
<i>Passenger Twitch, passenger
Leon Twitch, please pick up...</i>
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.
-Will you leave me alone?
-Someone's coming!
-A puppy!
-Bark, bark, bark, bark.
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.
Listen, flyboy.
The contents of that case are
worth more than you make in a year!
-You got that, sport? You be careful!
-l understand, sir.
Do you have a "fragile" sticker
or something?
l had a box of cookies once
that came back as crumbs!
The Mystic Portal!
Once we go through,
we just need to find that case.
-There's the case!
-No, there's the case!
You take that one! We'll take this one!
Whoa! Buzz!
Buzz, my back end's
goin' to Baton Rouge!
Slinky!
Here we come, Woody!
Woody, here we come! Woody!
Nice flash, though.
Okay, Woody, let's go!
Take that, space toy.
Hey! No one does that to my friend!
Your choice, Woody.
You can go to Japan together
or in pieces.
If he fixed ya once,
he can fix ya again. Now get in the box!
-Never!
-Fine!
-No!
-Gotcha!
ldiots! Children destroy toys!
You'll all be ruined, forgotten!
Spending eternity
rotting in some landfill!
Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you
learned the true meaning of playtime.
-Right over there, guys!
-No. No! No!
<i>Atlantic Air flight 810
from Point Richmond</i>
<i>is now arriving at Gate 3.</i>
Look, Barbie. A big, ugly man doll.
He needs a makeover.
Hi! You'll like Amy.
She's an artist!
Come on, hon!
Happy traiIs, Prospector.
-Buzz! Woody!
-Help us out here!
Hurry!
-Oh, no. Jessie! Come on!
-Oh, Woody!
Jessie!
Come on, Buzz.
Ride like the wind, BulIseye!
Hey-howdy-hey! Giddyap!
Come on, BulIseye!
Buzz, give me a boost!
Woody!
Here's the rest!
Excuse me, ma'am, but I believe
you're on the wrong flight.
-Woody!
-Come on, Jess.
-It's time to take you home.
-But
-what if Andy doesn't like me?
-Nonsense!
Andy'll love you! Besides,
-he's got a little sister.
-He does?
-Why didn't you say so? Let's go!
-Whoa!
Hold it! There's a couple
more bags coming from the terminal!
Okay. On three.
-One, two...
-Too late!
Put 'em on the next flight!
-This is bad.
-How are we gonna get outta here?
Over there! Come on!
-You sure about this?
-No! Let's go!
Hold on, Woody!
-What's a cowboy without his hat?
-Buzz!
Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tyres!
Jessie, let go of the plane!
What? Are you crazy?
Just pretend it's
the final episode of Woody's Roundup.
But it was cancelled!
We never saw if you made it!
Well, then, let's find out together!
We did it! We did it! We did it!
Nice ropin', cowboy.
That was definitely
Woody's finest hour!
Your hat, partner.
Let's go home.
Yee-haw!
Hey, Woody! Woody?
Oh, wow! New toys!
Cool! Thanks, Mom!
It's Bazooka Jane
and her jet-propelled horse!
Woody, Buzz, that polecat Zurg
has stolen my space cows!
Andy, come on, hon. Time to go.
-Hey, you fixed Woody!
-Yeah.
Glad I decided not to take him to camp.
His whole arm might have come off.
Well, what do you know?
Yee-haw!
Oh, BulIseye,
we're part of a family again!
Ma'am, l...
l wanted to say
you're a bright young woman
with a beautiful "yarnful" of hair.
"Hairful" of yarn. It's...
l must go.
Well, aren't you the sweetest
space toy I ever met?
What's that? Bark, bark?
This fella says he needs to go out
back for a little private time.
That critter needs help!
Hey, Rex,
l could use a hand over here, buddy.
l don't need to play. I've lived it!
No, no, no, no! Oh, nuts!
<i>Welcome to AI's Toy Barn.</i>
<i>We've got the lowest prices in town.</i>
<i>Everything for a buck, buck, buck.</i>
Well, I guess crime doesn't pay.
Oh, Andy did a great job, huh?
Nice and strong!
l like it. Makes you look tough.
You have saved our lives.
We are eternally grateful.
You saved their lives? Oh, my hero!
And they're so adorable!
Let's adopt them!
Daddy!
Oh, no.
Wheezy, you're fixed!
Oh, yeah. Mr. Shark looked in the toy
box and found me an extra squeaker.
-And how do you feel?
-Oh, I feel swell.
ln fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.
<i>You've got a friend in me</i>
<i>You just remember
what your old pal said</i>
<i>Babe, you've got a friend in me</i>
<i>Yeah, you've got a friend in me</i>
Come on over.
Oh, you are such a big girl.
Andy, you think she's ready
to drive the car yet?
Yeah, and I can teach her.
-You still worried?
-About Andy?
-Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
-I'm proud of you, cowboy.
Besides, when it all ends, I'll have old
Buzz Lightyear to keep me company
for infinity and beyond.
<i>You're gonna see it's our destiny</i>
<i>-You've got a friend in me
-Yes, you do</i>
<i>-You've got a friend in me
-That's the truth</i>
<i>You've got a friend</i>
<i>In me</i>
Yeah!
-Speed.
-Marker.
And action.
Okay. A little help here, please.
-What are we gonna do, Buzz?
-Use your head!
But I don't wanna use my head!
-Speed.
-Marker.
Okay, and pull back.
-l don't remember eating that.
-Cut.
-l can't believe this.
-That's the fifth time.
-What row is that guy in?
-Sorry.
l had that bean burrito for lunch.
Okay, I'm all right now. Sorry.
And action.
I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes
and your angry eyes just in case.
And if you get hungry,
here's some cheese puffs. And a key.
l don't know what it's for,
but you never know.
-Speed.
-Marker.
And action.
Could...? Should we just...?
Should that just be part
of the movie now?
He lost... He lost his string.
And the goIf ball,
if you have time for goIf.
And a plastic steak
and a rubber ducky and a yo-yo.
-Who's behind?
-Mine.
All right, cut. Good take.
What good acting.
That was a good take.
You're such a cute little bottom.
Look at you. Look at you.
Look at you. Look at you.
ln fact, I think I feel a song comin' on.
Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry.
Did I hurt your equipment?
You gotta aim it right here at my flipper.
I'm not a very good catch.
-Okay, I'm ready for another take.
-Let's go again.
Oh, no! Oh, no,
l think I swallowed my squeaker!
And an extra-bouncy bouncy ball.
And some extra teeth.
Be careful, they chatter.
Whoa!
-Marker.
And action.
We'll be back before Andy gets home.
What? What're you laughing about?
Real funny, Woody.
We're losing our light.
Wipe it off and let's go again.
Golly bob howdy.
What? What's so funny? Woody!
-Darn it, Woody!
-Okay, let's go again.
And crayons, in case you get bored.
And some blue Play-Doh.
Isn't this exciting, Heimlich?
Our first day of shooting.
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so exciting!
You know, I can't believe you talked
them into making A Bug's Life 2.
Yeah, I can hardly believe it aIso.
But there's a little baby tiny thing
l forgot to tell you.
What's that, Heimlich?
Well, it's a "2" movie,
but it's not A Bug's Life 2.
What...? I don't understand.
What is it then?
And action.
-Marker.
And action.
BulIseye, are you with me?
Okay, good boy.
Prospector, how 'bout you?
And so, you two are
absolutely identical?
You know, I'm sure I could get you
a part in Toy Story 3.
I'm sorry. Are we back?
All right, girIs.
Lovely talking with you.
Anytime you'd like some tips on acting,
I'd be glad to chat with you.
All right, off you go then.
-Speed.
-Let me check focus.
Did you make it
into the first Toy Story?
ln the letterbox copy, you can see
my arm grabbing Woody's ankle.
What will you do next?
I'm up for this villain
in a toothpaste commercial.
Wow, that's great.
And a dime, call me.
And monkey chow.
Monkey chow? For what?
Well, for the monkeys, of course.
Come on, monkeys.
That's it. I draw the line at monkeys.
Get my agent on the phone!
-Marker.
And action.
It's your choice, Woody.
You can go back, or you can stay
with us and last forever.
Good heavens. Was that me?
Oh, my. I am so sorry.
l guess that's why they call me
Stinky Pete.
Okay, let's cut.
We are so glad you came.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, now. Bye. Bye-bye.
Remember, please discard all candy
wrappers and popcorn containers
in the nearest trash receptacle.
Thank you.
Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye. Bye.
Okay.
Are they all gone?
Is everybody gone?
Huh?
