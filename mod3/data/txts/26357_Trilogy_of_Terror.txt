Hmm, woa,
the one in the dress.
Hi, how you doing?
Math class.
Oh there you go.
Oh, your coats terrific.
The whole things terrific.
God, have you ever seen
so many dogs in one place?
Oh, the trouble
with you Chad
is youre just spoiled.
Yeah, I know.
Good morning.
Now thats ugly.
I just got the weirdest idea.
Yeah, what?
I wonder what she looks like
under all those clothes.
Who, Aldridge?
Are you kidding?
No, Im not kidding.
Its kind of like the idea
just jumped into my head.
Basic literary triangle.
Can anyone tell me
why Fitzgeralds
name is on the bottom?
Mr. Foster.
Because Fitzgeralds
liberated work of the 20s
beginning with
创This Side Of Paradise创,
formed the base for
the extended realism
of both Hemingway
and Faulkner.
Quite correct.
I would like to amplify this
aspect of the discussion,
but I see by the clock
that our time is up.
Your assignment due
for tomorrows class
will be the final chapter of
创For Whom The Bell Tolls创.
You are to summarize this
chapter with special emphasis
on the prognostic time
continuum thought processes
relating to his fathers death
and his own
impending death in Spain.
Class is dismissed.
Youre welcome.
Youre welcome.
You sure carry a lot of books.
Yes.
Miss Aldridge, do you
go to the movies much?
Sometimes, not often.
No?
I do.
A lot.
But then I tend
to think in pictures.
Oh?
Yeah, you see my
hobbys photography.
Well thats very interesting.
Well I thought
that maybe we could...
Its very nice
talking with you Chad,
but I do have another class.
Yeah.
See you.
Youre really serious
about that, arent you?
Well if youve
got any funny ideas,
youd better forget it.
Dont go messing
around with teachers.
Oh really?
Gee, I didnt know that.
Going out tonight?
No, I have too much to do.
You know, for the kind
of money they pay you,
you put in an
awful lot of hours.
Thats true.
Julie,
Steve has a friend.
Hes a very nice guy.
But you cant just
stay home all the time.
Youve got to
go out some times.
Im all right Ann.
Dont worry about me.
The problem with you is
you dont give
yourself half a chance.
If youd work
at it just a little,
youd really be attractive.
Ann, have a nice time tonight.
Okay.
Good night.
Night.
That scene in 创Sanctuary创
where Faulkner has
his character
Popeye rape the girl.
I prefer Fitzgerald.
He only suggests violence.
Faulkner was just
telling it like it is.
I guess some
people enjoy violence,
lead perverted lives.
And speaking of perversion,
theres a wonderful
little vampire picture
playing down at the
Village Drive-In this Friday.
Its all in French
with English subtitles.
Its a real classic.
How about going
to see it with me
for reasons of
cultural expansion?
Well I thank you Chad,
but you know,
teachers arent
allowed to date students.
Or didnt you know that?
So, wholl find out?
My lips are sealed.
I wont tell.
You have your pick of all
these lovely coeds Chad.
Why would you want to date me?
Because I prefer
maturity in a woman.
All those others?
Theyre just a bunch of kids.
You look like
you could use a drink.
Yes I guess I could.
Its ridiculous,
but these kind of
things always upset me.
You want popcorn too?
Oh no, I couldnt
eat anything.
But a drink would be
fine Chad, thank you.
All right.
Whatll it be?
Two large root beers.
All right.
And easy on the ice.
Two large root beers,
easy on the ice.
How much is that?
A dollar.
There you go.
Thank you.
-- Thank you.
Heres your drink.
Thank you.
Tastes bitter.
Yeah, mine too.
I guess theyre not putting
enough syrup in them.
Whats the matter?
Dont you like
the movie Chad?
Sure I like the movie.
Its just that
I like you better.
Whats wrong?
I dont know.
Do you want to get
out and get some air?
Can I do something for you?
Yeah, I need
a room for the night.
Me and my wife.
The names Harker.
Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Harker.
You got any bags?
Yeah Ive got baggage.
Itll be fifteen
dollars in advance.
All right.
You need to fill out the card?
Thank you.
Yeah.
What time is it?
Its late.
Were home.
Boy you must have
really been tired.
How could I?
Did I really fall asleep?
Um-hmm.
Im sorry.
I mean this has never
happened to me before.
Im just sorry that I took
you to such a boring picture.
Well I...
I warned you at least.
I told you I wouldnt
be a very exciting date.
Forget it.
I decided to let you sleep.
I figured with
all the work you do,
you needed the rest.
Still Im afraid
I spoiled your evening.
No.
I had a fine time.
Chad, Im really sorry.
Hey,
I thought we agreed
to forget about that.
Yes, we did.
I had a very good
time, thank you.
Can I call you tomorrow?
I dont think so Chad.
Why not?
Because it was foolish
of us to go out tonight.
I could lose my job
and you could be expelled.
No board of trustees tells me
who to see and who not to see.
I do what I want.
Now Chad.
No, I really must
be firm about this.
We cant go out again.
Well see.
Good night Julie.
(Phone ringing)
Hello?
Its me, Chad.
Chad, Its not
even eight oclock.
I want to see you.
I told you last night
that I dont think we should.
Listen, you get dressed
because Im coming
over there right now.
You and I are taking
a little drive together.
Absolutely not.
Now whats the
matter with you?
I dont find this
at all amusing.
Its not meant to be.
Are you ready to tell me
why youre behaving this way?
Well, didnt I tell you?
My hobbys photography.
You drugged me
last night, didnt you?
How could you do
something this sick?
Well I think they came
out rather well, dont you?
Oh, and you can keep these,
because you see,
I have the negatives.
Ill call the police Chad.
No you wont.
First of all, you have no
proof that I drugged you.
Ill deny it,
and offer these
photos as proof.
Tell them you seduced me.
That youve got
a thing for your students.
Now, Im sure you
dont want the police
or anyone else to see these.
All right Chad.
What do you want from me?
The realism of Faulkner,
Steinbeck,
Hemingway
and even Hamot
opened the doors
to a new kind
of literary expression,
indigenous to the new
American frontier experience.
Here was a raw muscle prose
which completely
transformed the period
and formed a direct bridge
linking us all the way from...
from the aesthetic realism
of a Dreiser
to the rather disheveled...
Class is dismissed.
Class is dismissed.
What are you doing up?
Do you know what time it is?
Julie...
Will you please tell
me whats going on?
Nothing.
I didnt stay up all night
Im worried about you.
Im worried about you.
Its been like
this for a month now.
I know.
Julie, this isnt like you.
Please tell me
whats happening.
I really cant
talk about it Ann.
Go to bed.
(Music playing)
(Music stops)
Hey, I want that on.
I want it off.
Since when does
what you want count?
Since now.
Tonight.
This second.
Its all over Chad.
Its over.
Nothing is over
until I say it is.
I dont think so.
You see, Im bored.
And when Im bored,
the game is over.
Bored?
Um-hmm.
Not terrified, not shocked.
Just plain bored.
Whos idea did you think
this whole thing was?
What are you talking about?
What I am talking about Chad,
is that you are a singularly,
unimaginative young man.
Did you really think that
that dull little mind of yours
could possibly have conceived
any of the rather dramatic
experiences weve shared?
Do you remember the day
you watched me
walk up the steps?
Since that moment,
your mind has not
been your own.
Why do you think you suddenly
had the overwhelming desire
to see what I looked like,
under all those clothes?
Dont feel bad.
I always get
bored after awhile.
Although, there was
one boy in Denver
who did keep me amused
for almost nine weeks.
But then he was
wonderfully creative.
First youll
experience dizziness.
Then mild paralysis
and then total cardiac arrest.
Youve drugged me.
No dear, Ive killed you.
No!
I told you about
those chemicals Chad.
How dangerous they could be.
He was one of your
best students, wasnt he?
Yes, he was,
wonderfully bright
and a spirited boy.
You know, I warned him
about those chemicals,
how dangerous they could be.
Are you sure youre okay?
Julie, I can skip work
and stay here with you.
No, you go on.
Ill be fine.
Are you sure?
Yes Ann.
(Knock on door)
Miss Aldridge?
Yes.
Im Arthur Moore.
I saw your notice
on the board.
And you need help?
Yeah, I um...
my lit grades are lousy.
Do you have time
for me Miss Aldridge?
Of course I do Arthur.
In fact if you like,
we can start right now.
Oh thatd be great.
Id like that a lot.
Good.
I think were going
to be friends Arthur.
Very good friends.
The funeral is over
and Im alone in the house.
Therese is out cavorting
with one of her men
on this night when father
is barely cold
in his casket.
I ran some old family films
to remind myself
when it began.
Even then at twelve,
she was already
using her wilds on him.
Poor mother.
So weak, so innocent.
Never suspecting the
depth of evil in Therese.
My spoiled sister.
Her sweet little face
never fooled me
for an instant.
I knew the darkness behind it.
I knew the fomenting
ugliness in her soul.
Mr. Anmar?
Yes.
Please come in.
I know what youre thinking.
Youre wondering how
sisters look so unalike.
I have never
found it necessary
to affect the
ways of Therese.
Please sit down.
Is she here?
Oh no.
Shes gone to a party.
A party?
This afternoon
at the funeral,
she seemed so distraught.
My sister is an
unusual girl, Mr. Anmar.
I doubt that you
truly understand her.
Which is why
Ive called you here.
What do you mean?
I want you to
look at something.
Heres Therese and father.
She was fifteen then.
I want you to notice
the way shes pressing
herself against him.
I, I dont understand.
Why are you telling me this?
My sister is evil, Mr. Anmar.
I think you should know that.
Even as a child,
she was vicious and cunning.
But father worshiped her,
and she him.
When she was sixteen,
she seduced him.
Now look,
I dont know what
youre trying to do,
but I dont want to
hear any more of this.
It was not long after that,
that mother died.
The doctor said
it was an accident.
That she had taken an
overdose of sleeping pills.
But it was no
accident, Mr. Anmar.
It was Therese.
She had put those
extra pills in her milk.
If this is true,
how could you live in the
same house while they...
Well you see,
I had no place else to go.
I had no money
and no way to earn any.
No escape.
So,
I kept to myself
as much as possible,
and tried to avoid Therese,
to ignore what was happening
in this house.
You dont believe me, do you?
Miss Laura, I dont
know what to say.
These books show what she is.
Demonology.
Pornography.
Satanism.
Voodoo.
Witchcraft.
These books arent
just relics, Mr. Anmar.
She uses them to capture
the souls of others.
By her own admission,
Satan guides her.
You dont really expect me
to believe this, do you?
But you must
believe me, Mr. Anmar.
You see,
Thereses soul is damned.
I cannot help her.
But I can help you.
Miss Monroe,
Im afraid youre the one
that really needs help.
How naive you are.
Do you really think
she cares for you?
She lies to you.
She laughs at you.
Sorry, but I really
must be going now.
I know all about
that night at Morley
and what happened there.
She told you about that?
Yes.
She told me everything.
Gloated.
Bragged about how she
was able to corrupt you.
My sister enjoys
inflicting pain, Mr. Anmar.
And apparently she
somehow persuaded you
to share that perversion.
Now do you believe me?
Now you are saved, Mr. Anmar.
I have freed you from evil.
This afternoon while
I was out shopping,
Therese violated my room
in an insane act of revenge,
and upon my
return, raged at me
using foul and
obscene language,
cursing me for
having dared to reveal
the truth to Mr. Anmar.
Her behavior was
crude and astral.
Shes becoming more
violent by the day.
Its as if fathers death
has released
the demons within her
and I actually
fear for my life.
(Phone ringing)
Hello?
Dr. Ramsey, its Millie.
Its about Therese.
Shes much worse.
Oh, I thought we
settled that matter.
You were going
to see about Therese.
But you cant imagine
the things shes
been saying about me.
About us.
Us?
Shes jealous
of our relationship.
Shes twisted it
into something lewd
and something sordid.
Look Millie.
I have a hospital call to
make in your area tomorrow.
Ill drop by and
well talk about this.
Thank you doctor.
(Doorbell ringing)
Hi doc.
Come on in.
Ive been expecting you.
You want a drink?
No thanks.
No, course not.
I suppose youre here
on your usual mission?
I know all about
what dear little Millicent
told you on the phone.
I was listening on the
extension in my room you see.
I see.
So, I guess this is just
a wasted visit doctor.
Because I know Millicent
wont talk about me
when Im in the house
and here I am.
Did you destroy her room?
Yes I destroyed her room.
Why shouldnt I?
She deserved it.
I mean where does that
little twit get off
thinking shes got the right
to stick her nose
into my affairs.
Dont worry doc.
Im sure shes got it
all straightened up by now
in her proper little
housekeepers manner.
Therese, this hatred
has got to stop.
Youll destroy yourself.
Oh, I dont think so doc.
Besides, its really
all Millicent has.
Her hatred of me
is the only passion
in her lonely,
pathetic little existence.
You know,
youre really a very
handsome man, doctor.
If youd just
loosen up a little.
Oh, did that bother you?
Do I make you nervous, doctor?
I dont think we need
to carry this any further.
Whats the matter doc?
You still a virgin?
Or um...
is it that you
just dont like girls?
Ill call again soon.
We dont need
you anymore Ramsey.
Why dont you just get
the hell out of our lives?
Dont phone us
and dont call on us.
Leave, and dont
ever come back here.
Hes gone.
Dr. Ramseys gone Millicent.
He wont be back.
What do you think of
that dear little sister?
Answer me you creep.
But I wouldnt answer her.
Nor would I allow
her to enter.
I remained locked in my room,
silent while she
raged and swore at me.
Finally, she staggered
back into her own room
and fell into a drunken sleep.
How I loath her.
I could no longer bear
to live in this house,
and watch evil prevail.
Something must be done.
Yes.
Therese must die.
(Girl crying)
Tracy, whats wrong?
Whats the matter?
My doll is broken.
Oh, let me look at it.
Oh my.
How did this happen dear?
Your sister broke it.
Therese?
Therese did this?
But why, why did she do it?
I was just
playing with my dolly
when all of a sudden
your sister came running out
of the house and yelled at me.
She said I was
making too much noise.
Then she grabbed my dolly
and threw it on the
ground and broke its head.
I hate her,
Miss Millicent, I hate her.
You poor thing.
Next time Im in town,
Im going to buy you
a brand new dolly.
You will?
Will that make
you feel better?
Thank you Miss Millicent.
When I returned to the house,
I was still thinking
of Tracys broken doll.
And it was then
that the solution
suddenly became quite clear.
At last, I had
found the ideal way.
How ironic.
I would use Thereses
own books to destroy her.
I began to collect
the necessary items.
Parings from Thereses
long painted nails.
Strands from her
lovely blonde hair.
The rhinestone buttons
from her most
lewdly seductive dress.
And then at last,
I had all that was required.
Thereses life, held
literally within my hands.
(Phone ringing)
Hello?
Hello Dr. Ramsey.
Its Millie.
Ive been trying to
reach you since yesterday.
Millie, Im terribly worried.
We must talk.
I appreciate the
concern doctor,
but I no longer feel
there is any need to talk.
You see, things
are different now.
Ive found a way
to deal with Therese.
I insist that we talk.
That is all I have to
say to you Dr. Ramsey.
Your advice is
no longer required.
Goodbye.
(Phone ringing)
(Doorbell ringing)
Millicent?
Millie?
Millie, are you in here?
Millicent?
This is Dr. Chester Ramsey,
470 Stetton Place.
I want to report a death,
female, age twenty six.
Cause of death...
Cause of death unknown.
(Siren)
Just a moment,
before you take her away.
I was the family physician.
I knew her quite well.
Her name was
Therese Millicent Larimore.
The most advanced case
of dual personality
I have ever seen.
He who kills.
Boy are you ugly.
That face.
Even your mother
wouldnt love you.
Very sharp.
Arthurs going to love it.
Well, better get it over with.
Hi mom.
I couldnt call earlier.
I just got home.
Mother,
mother its about tonight.
I know we always spend
Friday night together,
but I thought...
no, I feel all right.
Its not that.
Mother, Im not sick.
Mother, theres a man.
His name is Arthur Breslau.
Hes a teacher
at City College.
Its his birthday and um,
well I sort of promised him
that wed spend the night...
um, the evening together.
Mother, it has nothing
to do with preferring.
When do I break
my word to you?
What do you mean when?
Give me a when,
when do I break my promises?
Well of course I love you.
Yes I do, yes I do dear.
Mother...
Mother Im not being cruel.
Its just...
its his birthday, thats all.
I see you two or
three nights a week.
Mother please stop
treating me like a child.
Im grown up.
Im not yelling.
Because I like it here.
Its only a sub-lease.
Theyll be back in six months.
I like having it...
for my own.
I like being alone.
I didnt mean it
that way, Im sorry.
About a month.
I...
I meant to tell you before.
Um...
hes a very nice man.
Hes kind and gentle.
Youd like him.
It didnt happen that way.
I met him after
I rented the apartment.
Mother, you should see
what Im getting
him for his birthday.
Its a genuine
Zuni fetish doll.
I found it in a
curio shop on Third Avenue.
Arthur teaches Anthropology.
Thats why I got it for him.
Its a Zuni hunting fetish.
Its really interesting.
Theres supposed to be some
Zuni hunters spirit
inside of it and um,
theres a golden
chain wrapped around it
to keep the spirit from
making the doll come to life.
Come to life.
It says, should
this chain be removed,
spirit in doll will
become one living...
well, thats what it says.
On the scroll.
The scroll.
It comes with the
doll inside the box.
You should see his face mom.
Mom?
Why is it always like this?
I will not get a headache.
I will not get a headache.
I am going to take a bath
and then Im going
to meet my fellow.
And were going
to have a lovely time.
A lovely time.
Mom.
Hello, Arthur?
Hi.
Well, I um...
you know me
too well, dont you?
It is our one
night on the town.
You know, every
Friday night, well...
you know,
Ive told you before.
I just dont want
to hurt her feelings.
My moving out was
hard enough on her.
Well, I know I had
every right to move out,
thats not the point.
I realize we planned to spend
the evening together, but...
Arthur...
its only one day.
Couldnt we celebrate your
birthday tomorrow night?
I just dont want
to hurt her feelings.
She is my mother after all.
All right.
Bye.
Hooray for Friday night.
What did you do,
fall off the table?
Whered you go?
Where are you?
Ow!
Well,
I guess I found you.
At least the tip
of your spear.
But how you got that far back.
Im getting warm.
Come out, come out
wherever you are.
(Running sound)
Is that you little man?
Hes got to be there.
(Sound from kitchen)
Whats going on?
Come on Amelia.
Now dont get
spooky on me Amelia.
Wooden dolls
do not move about.
That bulb probably
just burnt out.
(Screaming)
(Screaming)
(Screaming)
Oh, God.
Operator, operator,
please get the police.
I dont know
where Im located.
Just get the police.
Its an emergency.
Theres a, theres a...
just get me the police please.
(Screaming)
(Screaming)
This cant be happening.
This cant be happening.
(Scream)
(Screaming)
(Screaming)
(Screaming)
(Scream)
(Screaming)
(Doll screaming)
(Scream)
This is Amelia mom.
Im sorry
I acted the way I did.
I think we should
spend the evening together
just the way we planned.
Its kind of late though.
Why dont you
come by my place
and well go from here.
No, Im all right.
Good.
