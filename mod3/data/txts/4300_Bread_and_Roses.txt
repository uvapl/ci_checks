Let's go, let's go,
let's go.
Get behind me, get behind me.
Behind me...
don't nobody stay behind.
Shut up, motherfucker.
Cover yourself with the blanket.
Be quiet.
Move over there.
Are you the relatives?
Did you bring the money?
Over there.
The money.
- Yes, and the boys?
- Stay there.
Who paid you?
What's up? What's going on?
- Who do I let off?
- The children.
Get off, fucking kids.
Hurry up, I don't want to see you.
Move, bitch.
Lose weight, bitch.
What's up?
Come on.
Let's go, come on.
Maya Montenegro?
Here.
Get back in, bitch!
- What's this?
- I got mugged.
I don't give a shit
if you got mugged.
I'll pay you for her.
Here's my wedding band.
I'm coming, Maya.
- My watch.
- I'll pay too.
Let her out.
- Don't do it.
- Don't move.
- I beg you.
- Fuck you.
Don't take her away.
Rosa, help me!
Where are you taking me,
motherfucker?
Rosa, help me, Rosa.
Help me, Rosa!
Move away from the window.
Why are you crying now, huh?
Where are you taking me?
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
- You cry a lot, huh?
- Don't fuck with me.
- Shut the fuck up.
- Take out a coin.
Let's have a toss to see
what happens to her.
Somebody will get laid
tonight, man.
Do you want it, or not?
Toss it, man.
Let's see it.
Fuck it, man.
Let me carry your bag,
you're tired.
Don't be like that with me.
I'm not like that prick.
What's wrong?
Don't worry.
I'm not like that prick.
You're not as ugly as
I first thought.
But you stink, motherfucker.
You don't smell bad
yourself, honey.
Do you like them?
Where did you get them?
In Tijuana, they're
the coolest in all Tijuana.
Later.
It's late, sweetheart.
- Do you like to sing?
- No, honey.
I know very well
that I'm outside...
Hit it.
But the day that I die,
I know you'll have to cry.
You do sing nice, sweetie.
Cry and cry...
Fly and fly...
It's "cry", man.
Oh, that's right.
I'll follow you, then.
Then a mule-seller
told me...
No, I got it wrong
already.
That you don't have
to get there first,
But you have to know
how to do it...
That's it,
go on, go on.
With or without money,
I always do what I want,
And my word is the law.
Oh, mama!
Turn around,
let me lather you up.
I'm liking you already.
Put some water on.
You lather me up good.
And that's how
you're gonna stay.
With or without money,
I always do what I want.
- You sing well.
- Let's see.
- Excuse me?
- Hold on a sec.
Don't be long.
Didn't you like my voice?
You do sing,
I had heard you before.
I know you like me, honey.
I told you I'd heard you
in the car.
I know, you've been looking
at my hair, it drives them crazy.
How do you
take care of it, man?
But you must know
how to get there.
What the fuck?
You bitch.
Bitch.
Open it, bitch.
Open it right now!
Fucking bitch!
Fucking bitch.
Where are you?
Fucking bitch!
Come back, you cunt!
My boots!
Son of a bitch!
Luis, how are you?
It's me, Maya.
Mom!
How are you doing?
Oh, you,
you are so big.
- She's here! Rosa!
- Simona! Look at you.
Mom was so worried.
You're taller than me.
What happened?
I was so scared.
Thank God you're here.
- And who is she?
- Uh, Grandma.
Ah, exactly.
- Granny.
- Yes.
This is the dress
we sent her.
Uncle...?
Enrique.
Uncle Quique.
Let me see Uncle Quique.
- Rosa, look at this.
- Wow.
And she is Valeria.
Check out Valeria
in her dress.
At her party.
Beautiful.
It's time to go
and do homework, okay?
Luis, Simona,
you have a test tomorrow.
Simona, make sure
that your brother
is doing everything the
way he should be doing it.
I will stay with you.
No watching TV or anything.
Make sure he does everything right.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
What happened
with the money?
I've been penniless
since Bert got sick.
Why didn't you tell me, Rosa?
Those guys are crazy.
Who's crazy?
I told you.
I told you, but you bugged
and bugged me.
You've never listened to me.
Easy, easy, hey, hey.
What's going on here?
You said you had it fixed up.
You don't mess with these guys.
- I thought I did.
- What happened with the money?
Listen...
I know someone
who owns a bar.
I got you a job there.
He promised me...
$800 in advance
of your wages.
Okay?
But he has a brother
and he didn't tell his brother.
They got into a big argument
and this morning
they only gave me $300.
Rosa...
I want to work with you
cleaning the offices.
So do hundreds of others.
We talked about this before.
I know, but I'm fitter,
I'm faster.
We're not gonna talk
about this anymore.
Enough is enough.
- Please.
- Okay.
What kind of bar is it?
Hey, baby.
Excuse me again.
Where are you from?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- From Mexico.
- Whereabouts in Mexico?
- Mexico City.
- They say Mexico City girls
are all sluts.
I don't know.
Where are you from?
Guatemala.
You know what I've been told?
That Guatemalans
are all fairies.
That's not possible.
Careful with the bottle.
I hope you don't get me into trouble
with the guy at the door.
Why?
I told you you couldn't come.
You can't come in.
What do I do?
I don't know.
Just stay out.
- I'll wait here.
- Shut up.
I'll be here all night, Rosa.
- How are you doing?
- Oh, not too good.
Not too good? Oh.
Hi, can I help you?
Sorry?
- Waiting for someone?
- Er... no.
You can't hang here.
Do you speak English?
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I speak English.
I can understand everything.
You can't hang here.
You have to leave.
- Got that?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Hi.
Are you okay?
- Excuse me?
- Are you lost?
No, no, I'm okay.
Do you know anybody
who could help me get a job?
Not really,
but I could ask around.
Hey, gentlemen...
guys, guys.
She can't hang here.
I'm just making
sure she's all right.
She's all right.
She was just getting ready to leave.
- She's fine.
- She's doing nothing wrong.
I'm okay.
Look, man, you know the policy.
She can't hang here.
You sure you'll be okay here?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Come on, man, we're late.
Let this guy do his job.
You know, he's a good guy.
- Fucking son of a bitch bastard.
- What the fuck did he say?
- Motherfucker. Let's go.
- What the fuck did he say?
I got your "Pina,"
whatever the fuck he's saying.
What did he say?
I don't know, your hair...
I don't think that I...
Can you turn around
so I can see it?
Can you turn sideways?
Turn around?
Yeah, that's not...
that's not good.
It has to be tighter, okay?
'Cause it's very dangerous.
Some machines, and...
the uniform is a little too big.
I mean, can I see you tighten it?
Can you hold it on your waist
and pull it tighter so I can...
Yeah, that's nice.
Good, that's better.
That's nice.
Thanks for this chance,
Mr. Perez, and...
I will...
I will work hard.
I know you will.
I know.
It's about time we got
someone young in here,
got rid of some of these
old fucking hags. They're worthless.
You know, I get letters...
begging me to work here.
You know how lucky you are?
Do you realize that?
You know, 'cause
I do a favor for Rosa.
You know, arrange the paperwork.
You know, decent paperwork.
So, for that...
I charge a commission.
Oh.
What kind of commission?
You first month's salary.
We can split it
over two months...
I mean, you know?
What do you say?
Hi.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You're not running...
it's not a marathon, okay?
It's not the Special Olympics.
- I'll never finish on time.
- Yes, you will.
Let me show you something.
Hold it.
Go plug this up down there.
You trying to kill yourself?
No.
I'll never finish on time.
You'll finish. Just slow down.
Take your time.
Relax, take your time.
Get a little rhythm in it.
Take long steps.
Kinda swing your butt,
your shoulders and your hips,
and come back,
then you just go back
the other way.
Act like you're dancing, okay?
This is your man...
- With a vacuum?
- Yeah.
- This is your man, okay?
- Oh, sure.
If you do it like this,
you'll cover the grounds.
Here, you try.
Go on, go on.
You're doing it right. Come on.
Think about it. We're dancing, okay?
Easy, up then back.
Up and back.
Okay, there you are.
I'm telling you, girl,
that's your man.
Treat him good,
he treats you good.
Watch, Maya, first use
the screwdriver, like this.
That's easier.
- Yeah, that's the idea.
- Not with the finger.
But first you have to clean up
these little bits.
It's stuck.
But be careful,
because sometimes
the draft blows
the dirt in your face.
Doesn't appear that there
are any material facts.
All the discovery is done.
I think you should do it.
The judge just isn't
ready to grant it.
If we prevail on a couple
of issues, it'll be all right.
It costs a lot,
and she's very...
I think it's really
a good idea.
Did I tell you my theory
about these uniforms?
No.
They make us invisible.
Well, come on.
Let's move on to the other one.
Why?
We have to wait for it
to come back.
- What are you doing?
- Hold it a minute.
Good heavens, woman.
What are you doing?
- ... but he was great.
- If this goes wrong...
We're gonna need
the assignment languages.
If this doesn't work,
you're gonna be up to your ass
in shareholder derivatives.
I know that. Who pushed
all the fucking buttons?
You're nuts, woman.
It's your first day.
There he goes
down there. Come on!
- Son of a bitch!
- Motherfucker!
Where are you?
Excuse me.
Don't be scared.
- Is that wax?
- Yes.
I'm sorry.
Fucking bitch!
Don't let us catch you,
motherfucker!
Come out, fucker!
Shit.
Where are you,
motherfucker?
Get out of the way.
Aw, fuck!
Son of a bitch!
Where did he go?
- Oh, God damn.
- The other side.
Ernest, you went the wrong way,
goddamn it!
- Fuck.
- Which way?
What, what the fuck?
Oh, shit.
You can get hurt down here.
I'm really sorry about that.
- It doesn't matter.
- I'm not a thief.
I promise.
Don't turn me in.
No.
Does this end...
Oh, great.
I gotta get to the
service elevator.
Service elevator, okay?
It's right there,
down the hallway.
- Thanks a lot, miss.
- You're welcome.
Where are you,
motherfucker?!
Nobody touch that motherfucker
until I get him.
His shit is mine.
This is really nice of you.
You're not going to get into trouble.
- Yes. Shut up.
- Ow!
Sorry.
Son of a bitch.
Dispatch, we lost him.
That's wonderful, assholes.
What are you,
the maricón triplets?
Stop calling us that, would you?
Fuck off, baldy.
Just find him,
will you, you prick?
Shut the fuck up.
At least we're doing something.
Who was that?
That 4'2", walking, talking dick?
Just shut your fat ass up.
Perez, you're the only
one with a brain...
Oh, sir, I'll take that.
Shit!
We gotta find him.
Whoa, whoa,
what have you got in there?
Oh, books, and...
old telephone books.
Okay, get out.
Okay, thank you.
That was actually exciting.
Yeah.
So what's your name?
- Berta?
- No.
- Rosa?
- No.
- Teresa?
- No.
- Well, you're not Juan.
- No, sure...
Where did you get that list?
CIA.
- Anna?
- No.
Where did you get it?
I stole it off their notice board.
You're Maya, right?
How do you know?
Who the hell are you?
Hello.
Hi, Auntie.
Mom, Auntie is here.
Already?
Where are you?
Why did it take you so long?
Because the lines
were endless.
I got you this one
because they didn't have
the other kind.
I'll get it.
- Hi. Is Rosa in?
- Hi.
Yeah. Hold on.
Mom!
There's somebody
at the door.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Hi. I'm Sam Shapiro,
the Justice for Janitors Campaign.
I'm Rosa,
"Justice for Rosa Campaign. "
- Who is it?
- What do you want?
He has come to throw
the wax all over the floor.
Is this the "payaso"
you told me about?
Yeah.
I'm actually here
with the Janitors' Union.
May I come in for a second?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
So, Sam...
you any good
with electric fans?
Am I...? No, you actually
don't want me to touch that.
- This is Luis. Sam.
- Hi, Luis.
- Please, have a seat.
- Oh, thanks.
You want money, huh?
Yeah. More money
than you ever imagined.
You know what this is?
Let me see.
Wait.
This is a check stub.
That's right.
How much is it an hour?
- $8.50.
- $8.50?
- What's the date?
- December 22nd, 1982.
That's 17 years ago.
17 years ago,
that cleaner earned $8.50,
plus health,
plus sick pay, plus holidays.
Okay?
Today...
Los Angeles 1999,
you don't have a union deal,
you get $5.75...
plus nothing.
Over the past 20 years,
they've been taking
billions of dollars from the poorest
communities in this city.
Billions, okay?
We're gonna get that back.
Not millions,
billions of dollars. Billions.
You think I'm nuts.
Think I'm kidding?
I think you're cute.
You and what army's gonna
get this money back, pal?
Let me ask you something.
Does Rosa ever work late?
Oh, no, she can't.
She plays golf.
Does she get overtime?
Are you out on a weekend pass
from the nuthouse?
Health care, dental care.
Not just for her,
for the whole family.
Listen. Let's say one
of your kids gets sick.
Or Rosa.
Dad is sick.
- What?
- Dad is sick.
Yeah, he needs
an operation soon...
or else he'll get worst.
Much worst.
- What's wrong?
- Diabetic.
His eyes are really bad.
- Look, that's my problem.
- Bullshit. Come on.
- Watch your mouth.
- No offense, but...
you're ill, all right?
The kids are losing out,
all because these fucking bastards...
excuse my language...
these bastards at Angel
do not want to pay
health insurance.
How much do the kits cost?
$250? $300?
He ran out of test strips, too.
Look, Bert,
if Rosa had this...
the health care...
if, if, if...
I hear this word once more...
Listen to me.
He will be treated by now.
It doesn't have to be "If".
The union buildings downtown,
every janitor has health care.
Every one of them.
Don't take my word for it,
go down there and talk to them.
I think that's a great idea.
Would you do that?
I don't think so.
Why not? Hmm?
If you got together
with a few of them,
they would tell you exactly
how they did it, step by step.
And if the company finds out,
they're out. Right?
Well, start with a few
you can trust.
- I trust nobody.
- All right, go to a safe place.
One mistake...
I'm on a blacklist.
Do you have any idea
what those "pendejos" are like?
You have every chance...
There is every chance
you can get fired.
I've seen it before.
So don't give me any shit here.
What are you going to do?
Pay the rent, feed my kids?
And you'd better keep away
from this "payaso. "
They will fire anyway.
If you say something...
Oh, listen,
she is the expert here.
No, I'm not.
Mom, calm down.
- Dad, could you just...?
- That's enough.
Be quiet! You know everything
till you fuck up another job.
- No, I don't know anything.
- Be quiet when I talk to you!
I'll get you another job
just like this.
You know what?
You two, homework.
- You don't have to get my job.
- Quiet. You...
This is it. We don't have
any time anymore.
We have a lot of shit to do.
We're busy, so get out.
Listening never hurt anyone.
That's all I'm asking.
You know what?
We might be
at the bottom of the shithole,
but we are doing our best.
That's where we're going to stay
if we let them get away with it.
"We"? "We"?!
When was the last time
you got a cleaning job?
You and your union.
Your fat union white boys.
College kids.
What the hell do you know?
This campaign is different.
Don't ever say "we. "
I believe in nothing. Nobody.
Nothing.
Nothing but this.
Do you hear me, wise guy?
Now, get out.
- Get out! This is my house.
- Thank you for your time.
This is my house,
and nobody tells me
what to do in my house.
What's wrong with you?
What do you mean,
"What's wrong with you?"
You just have to listen.
- Just shut up, everybody!
- He's not talking nonsense.
Just do your homework.
Sam.
Thanks.
You forgot something.
Thank you.
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right.
Yeah.
Good to see you again.
Give me a call if...
whatever, you know.
Political...
- Manumeter, many meter... many...
- All these books.
He's spent three years like this,
coming in early.
Why so many books?
Try helping him,
you could learn something.
You know what's
the best part?
He copies every single thing
from the book.
What is your problem?
Why the fuck
does he do that?
And why the fuck
do you bug him so much?
He's supposed to be the
smart one, the intelligent one.
You know what
I don't understand?
Why the fuck don't you just
photocopy those things?
Hey, hey!
Come here.
Come here.
Not you.
You, come over here.
What time is it?
What time does it say
on the clock?
- I'm sorry. My bus.
- What?
What?
I can't hear you.
- The bus.
- I'm not asking you.
Am I talking to you?
I can't hear.
What's the problem?
- I'm sorry, the bus...
- Where are your glasses?
- Where are your glasses?
- My glasses?
You can't see, you can't work.
What's the problem?
I left them in my house.
I'm sorry, sir.
Well, if you can't see,
you can't work.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry, sir.
My bus, it slowly...
Bullshit.
Your bus was late.
Everybody else was on time.
What happened?
You know what?
You lose a shift.
Don't come back
without your glasses.
- You can't see.
- I forget to wear.
- What the fuck is going on?
- I'm sorry.
Fucking elderly
and fucking blind.
Get me some crippled people,
some fucking lepers.
This is a fucking business
we're running
not a fucking camp
for spastics.
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry.
Do yourself a favor,
don't come back.
- Don't come back!
- Tomorrow.
There is no tomorrow.
Don't come back.
Please, I need my work.
You never finish on time any ways.
I don't want to hear it.
You're fired.
Get out of here.
I need my work.
You can't finish on time anyways.
Do something else.
I need... I need work.
I need my work.
She reminds me
so much of my mother.
I need my work.
Hello?
Hello, excuse me,
is that Sam Shapiro?
- Yeah, this is Sam.
- Hello, Sam. I'm Maya.
- Hi, Maya.
- Do you remember me?
Of course.
The Toluca Street gang.
Ah, yeah.
Listen, something
happened at work.
So we would like
to talk with you.
Now, this building...
I don't know if you know this...
is one of the most important
buildings in L.A. right now.
That's because
Angel Cleaning Company
is one of the biggest cleaning
contractors in the country,
and they managed to outbid
union cleaning companies.
And you know how they do that?
They cut your wages.
Yeah. They don't pay
health insurance.
- Do you have health insurance?
- No.
I'll make it very clear.
I'll do a little diagram for you.
- Do you have a pen?
- Yeah, I do.
Okay, look,
take any building, right?
Here's your building.
You have your owners...
All right? Next you've got
your cleaning contractors.
Okay?
Next, we've got
the tenants, okay?
Now this is where
it gets very interesting,
because the tenants...
who are the tenants?
You know, finance houses,
big banks.
Some of the biggest banks
in the country
are operating out
of this building.
These guys, they have tremendous,
tremendous reputations.
They don't want
any problems, right?
What we have to do,
is we pressure these guys
to make these guys
hire union companies.
How do you force them?
There's many ways to do it.
You go...
I'll explain it to you.
You go to...
It's how they started
to get all of us.
Hold on.
You see people are interested
in hearing something?
Let them hear it,
then we'll talk.
- I'll explain to you.
- I'm listening.
You close off
an intersection.
Close off one set of traffic lights
downtown at rush hour,
you realize the effect
that has on all these people?
Can you imagine
how many lawyers
and secretaries
and accountants and...
business people
and banks...?
You know how many people
are going to be affected by that?
Multiply that throughout
the entire city,
believe me, it's cheaper
to pay you a decent wage.
Are you fucking crazy?
What are you
talking about here?
Who's gonna do it?
We've done it, okay?
We've done this, and it works.
We have a group
of workers...
Okay, guys, don't listen, please,
to these fucking idiots.
Okay, look.
That's fine.
Don't listen, all right?
Don't listen to me, all right?
Talk to the other cleaners.
Talk to the guys
who are in the union, okay?
They're having open meetings
in the garage right now.
If we don't do it,
who's gonna do it for us?
That's what they're saying.
If we organize together...
But what's wrong with talking
to the other janitors?
- Just talking with them?
- Okay, listen.
I am a worker here like you.
I have been here
only eleven month.
My English is bad
like yours.
I had nothing in Russia,
but here I have my job.
I can feed my kids,
I can pay rent, I can do everything.
Maybe tomorrow my life
will be better than today... yes!
If we will listen to him,
we will have trouble, believe me.
What happened with you?
What happened...?
Shut up, please.
Okay, let's go.
No, no, no. Shut up, you.
You are not the boss here.
You're a janitor
like everybody else.
Okay, okay, shut up.
Let's go because I can't have
any deals with this.
It's not my business.
Let's finish this meeting.
No, we want to listen.
And you never come back.
Please, I beg you.
Where are we going?
Don't be so impatient.
Go on, tell me.
Wait and see.
Ruben.
Hey, Maya.
Look.
Read it.
Did you pay $1,600?
Yes, I've been saving
for this for years.
And you know what?
I'm going to college.
- This one?
- Yes.
- Like that?
- I'm paying 20%.
They're gonna pay 80%.
- Who?
- A company. It's about $16,000,
16,000 fucking dollars.
Imagine that.
I've been waiting for this
since I got to this country.
How are you gonna pay
for that?
Well, see,
first I took an exam.
I didn't do so well
in the oral exam,
but I came in first
in the math test.
But even then they didn't give me
a scholarship, and you know why?
Simply because
I'm not an American citizen.
But then...
I found a private foundation
belonging to two Mexican brothers,
with a lot of money.
They had about 800
applications,
and guess who they chose?
- No?!
- Number one, baby.
Yes! And then?
But now what I have to do
is show proof...
that I paid 20% of the cost
by the first day of the semester,
and I only have $1,600 to go.
- And that's it.
- Really?
- That's it.
- Congratulations.
No, I can't believe it.
"I've just moved into
my new office, Mama,
but things at home
are not going so well.
You can't find a good maid
available nowadays,
and forget about
a good cook.
Besides, I need somebody
to walk the dog,
so I am sending
my chauffeur, Hector... "
Maya!
"... to go straight into the city
to pick you up.
He has strict orders
to lock you up in the trunk
if you start acting up. "
Maya!
Oh, Maya, come quick.
Perez is mad. He's pissed off
and he wants us downstairs now.
- Now?
- Right now. Come on.
We have enough
problems. Come on.
You think you're pretty
fucking smart, don't you?
Don't you?
Pretty fucking smart.
You didn't think we'd find out
about your little fucking meeting?
Well, you know what?
We're fucking smarter than you.
Oh, what's this I got
in my back pocket?
Anybody seen this before?
Look at it!
"Media. "
Where the fuck do you think
you are, the White House?
You know what?
Join a union.
They'll take 20%
of your fucking check.
Join a union.
They'll check your fucking papers.
You got Immigration.
Join a union.
They'll make
your fucking life difficult.
Look at me.
Look at me!
No fucking union, right?
Right?!
And let me tell you this,
if we catch any of you
talking to those motherfuckers,
we got security,
we got surveillance cameras
everywhere.
You can get the fuck out of here.
You're gone.
Try it.
Now get back to work.
Get out of here!
I don't want to fucking see you guys.
Go back to work?
Go back to work.
Get out of here.
Back to work!
You've still got to finish on time.
Get out of here.
Here's what I think
of your fucking flyer.
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't even want to see you guys.
- Berta.
- Yes?
Three and a half floors.
It's hard.
Takes it out of you.
How would you like
a vacation?
- Would you like that?
- Sure, I'd like that.
Take a week off?
Everything paid for.
- $12.50 an hour.
- Oh, that's nice.
Sounds good?
- With insurance.
- That, too?
The company,
we have new contracts.
And we're gonna be very busy.
We gonna need people...
people we can trust a lot.
A lot of confidence.
How would you like
to be a supervisor?
Me?
That would be cool.
I'd try to do it
as best as I can.
Yeah, because you've
been here a long time.
- How many years?
- 17 years here.
And do you think
you could be a supervisor?
Yes, I could do it.
That's all I wanted to know.
Thank you.
Berta?
Sit down again.
One thing.
Who organized the meeting,
with the union?
Who was it, Berta?
Do you know?
Can you tell me who it was?
Come in.
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- What happened?
What's this?
What is this?
Don't you even remember?
No, it's 3:00 in the morning.
I don't know.
You left it...
in the basement,
and Perez found it.
- The supervisor.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- Have you any idea
what it's like to have
this guy on our back?
Can I ask you something?
What do you risk?
Huh?
How much do you get paid?
$22,250.
So, what happened?
You get fired?
No.
- They fired Berta.
- Shit.
They wanted to know
who organized the meeting.
But she wouldn't tell them.
So...
I feel really stupid, okay?
I feel... I fucked up.
Yeah, I know, but...
she has all her family
in El Salvador,
and sends them money...
all her money for them,
since 17 years ago.
She was saving the money
for her daughter's wedding.
She has not seen her for five years.
You don't understand...
We're going to work it out.
We'll work something out, okay?
You want a drink?
I don't know what else
to offer you right now. I'm sorry.
Yes. Thanks.
Good, 'cause I need one.
Here.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Yep.
It's not great,
but it does work.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
Well, don't see Rosa
for the rest of your life.
She is ready
to cut your balls off.
That's nice.
Yeah, she's a tough one.
Sometimes...
I get scared...
everything is going
to go wrong.
Sometimes, I...
I think, what is going
to happen with me?
And...
I don't have an answer.
I'm scared.
Oh, please.
Thanks.
- "Better rights," right here...
- Shh! He's watching us.
Yeah, there's
always been trouble.
If he says something,
talk about what we're gonna eat.
- Let's go, guys, let's go.
- It's gonna be fine. Come on.
Fuck.
- All right, let's go eat.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Where the fuck do you
think you're going?
- We're going for a walk.
- We're gonna get burritos.
- It's lunch break.
- Bullshit. Get back over there.
No, I don't think so.
Lunchtime's our time.
- You can't keep us in.
- Who the fuck said so?
Who says? The law.
The court.
So if you can read
this judgment...
Bullshit. You want to read that?
Read that.
- We all got a copy.
- Bullshit, Oscar.
- Don't talk to him like that.
- I don't give a fuck what you have.
Read it.
Read it, okay?
Just read it really carefully.
It is our right to organize.
Okay?
- This is bullshit.
- We got an attorney...
Oh, you got an attorney?
You got an attorney?
- ... to tell us what we can do.
- Is that right?
- Hurry up.
- Get the fuck out.
- Don't talk like that, man.
- Fucking troublemaker, man.
Rosa,
where are you going?
Get your fucking hands
off me, man.
Perez, Perez.
What is this shit, Freddy?
What the fuck is this?
- I don't know.
- "Restrained and cursed"?
"Coursed. "
What is that word there?
- "Coerced. "
- "Coerced"?
Is that good?
No, I don't think so.
Fuck.
We're here tonight to send
a very strong message
to all these building owners,
that janitors in this city
are getting ready to fight
and will do
whatever it takes
to have much better working
conditions in this city...
especially buildings
like this one behind you
that is cleaned
by a non-union company
that don't treat workers right.
Yeah, that's right.
I have great news for you, okay?
For the first time,
we have non-union janitors
from Building 646.
Yes!
Guys, I'd like you to come up
and introduce yourselves.
We can do it!
We can do it!
I'm very happy
to be here this night.
I'm very glad to hear that,
and to see that
there are some students,
to see other workers
from other unions.
All this reminds me
of something that
sometimes we forget.
We have always got
more strength
than we realize.
Always.
I learned that
in my country,
when I organized
the students, campesinos,
workers, back there
in El Salvador.
But, sometimes
life is very hard.
Sometimes you lose
someone you love,
your family, a friend...
but you have
to come to this country
and sometimes
you can become sad, angry,
upset, frightened,
or even lose hope.
And I feel the hope back
now that I'm here with you,
so thank you for that.
What do we want?
Justice! Now!
Janitors united...
Will never be divided!
Hello.
Have one of these.
We're trying to fight for a
decent wage for these people.
Mr. Griffin. Hi.
You're the building manager
from 646, right?
- Yeah. Do I know you?
- No, but I know who you are.
- Griff, what the hell is going on?
- Let me ask you something.
Can you survive
off $5.75 an hour?
Because that's what the janitors
at your building get.
You know what?
I don't hire the janitors,
and I don't pay the janitors.
I suggest that you take this up
with their employers,
- which is Angel Services...
- This is really good wine.
You shouldn't tell tales,
Mr. Griffin.
You are the building manager.
You take it up.
Who do you think you are?
Coming in here, telling me...
I need... I need to do
whatever I want to do.
This is... sit down...
this is private...
Eat the broccoli.
It's really good for your heart.
- It looks good.
- Yeah, that looks great.
Do you mind
if I have a bite of that?
What's good for my heart
is you can leave now.
- Really delicious.
- My lambchop!
Tony! Tony!
The guy just stole
a lambchop off of my plate!
What kind of place is this?
These accusations!
I'm not a thief.
What are you doing with that?
Give me that!
What are you doing?
- Make sure he pays his bill.
- Yeah.
We know, Mr. Griffin,
how you walk out on bills.
All right. You're not helping
your cause.
You're going to hear
from my lawyer.
I'm tired
of being harassed!
This march took place
in Century City,
Los Angeles in 1990.
So, you're going to see it,
where it is,
and we'll talk about it.
For the janitors
of Los Angeles,
this was supposed to be
just another morning.
They would sing,
they would march,
some would go to jail.
But when the marchers reached
the entrance to Century City,
they found themselves
trapped in a movie,
a very bad movie.
Twice the demonstrators
tried to submit to arrest.
The police moved in
with a vengeance.
No provoking!
No provoking!
The marchers were barely able
to scramble to sanctuary
in a nearby neighborhood.
50 of them would go to jail.
But more than 60 demonstrators
would end up in hospitals
and emergency rooms.
Among them,
were two pregnant women,
one of whom would miscarry.
I want to survive
in this country, legally.
I'm not robbing a bank,
or doing anything wrong.
I'm simply asking for an increase
for the work that I do.
And the policeman hit me
on my back and my hip.
And he shoved me,
as though I were garbage.
He hit me awful.
<i>I started to learn English</i>
<i>Because I had no choice</i>
<i>To fight the gringo boss
I had to have a voice...</i>
<i>I used to work at a place</i>
<i>Where they wanted
to boss me around,</i>
<i>Just because
of the goddamn English</i>
<i>I couldn't speak</i>
<i>The gringo boss got angry
and yelled at me in English...</i>
<i>"You wetbacks
don't understand</i>
<i>What you are
supposed to do. "</i>
Here's one from the people,
for the people!
It goes like this.
I can't dance.
I can't dance.
<i>I'm here to sing to you</i>
<i>About a sad situation</i>
<i>With the laws being made</i>
<i>By the White House
and Immigration</i>
<i>All of my Latin people</i>
<i>Suffer from discrimination</i>
<i>They take away our rights</i>
<i>And sic the INS on us</i>
<i>But I won't leave this place</i>
<i>I won't leave,
I'll never leave...</i>
<i>So I say it here singing</i>
<i>This joyful melody</i>
<i>It's better to die fighting</i>
<i>Than to die on your knees</i>
<i>We have to follow the example</i>
<i>Of the legendary César Chávez</i>
<i>And all together we say now,</i>
<i>We can do it, we can do it</i>
Scream!
<i>We can do it!</i>
<i>We can do it!</i>
We'll go on, of course.
To the day-laborers
of the Norte!
Somebody!
Somebody call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance.
We need some help.
Ma'am?
Ma'am.
- Is my dad okay?
- How is he?
He's okay. His diabetes is serious,
but he's not critical.
- Meaning?
- He's stable now, so don't worry.
He was dehydrated,
we gave him fluids.
It's very common
with diabetics.
What's the difference between
"critical" and "serious"?
- He has some renal dysfunction.
- His kidneys?
And I suspect he has
some early retinopathy.
Both his eyes
will need laser treatment.
You mean he can go blind?
Ma'am, look,
you need to make an appointment
with a diabetes clinic.
They'll make an assessment,
run some tests and help you.
No, I can't wait anymore.
I've been waiting
months and months,
and they fuck up the date.
Now I'm telling... shit!
- Listen...
- I can't wait anymore.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm sorry, you'll just have
to speak to them, okay?
Wait, wait! I want to have
a word with you.
I'll catch up with you.
Come here.
Three injunctions
in two days?
Come on.
What is that?
You want to tell me what you were
doing in Beverly Hills at night?
- It's a free country.
- Not in Beverly Hills, it isn't.
What is this?
- Singing, dancing...
- A little lullaby for Mr. Wallace.
Who is he?
Chief executive
of Angel Services.
What is this in here
about jamming his office up
with 400 faxes in one day?
I'm trying to get
in contact with the guy.
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?
The lawyers are going insane.
Don't you understand?
I'm trying to keep the
executive board off your back.
They're crawling up my ass.
Is that what you want?
The old-timers
are waking up, finally?
Don't go there, okay?
Let's see where you are
in 10 years, okay?
We ought to start talking
about changing our target.
What? We've been working
this building for four months,
- No way I'm changing targets.
- What do you have to show for it?
- Jack shit, Sam.
- I'm on my...
people are waiting for me.
What do you want me to say?
- "Go for an easier target"?
- No, a better target.
A better target, with a better
goal for your efforts.
That's what you tell them.
Remember who pays your wages.
You like the good old days,
where you collect your dues,
pay your pensions,
fuck the organizers.
Don't you preach to me,
you fucking dickhead!
You have no idea the fucking
battles I have been through.
Another one of these,
we're in debt, you want that?
You're not going to have your
$40 million to give the Democrats,
so they can piss it
down the toilet, like last time?
In debt.
Do you know what that means?
Our hands tied behind our back?
Subject to broad order?
Sent back to the Stone Age
because of your carelessness?
No organizers anywhere?
Is that what you want?
Think!
To be continued.
Venceremos!
I get another one of these,
I'm shoving it up your ass!
Give me a fucking
heart attack.
You know the Hollywood
lawyers on the 27th floor?
- Remember those ones?
- Yeah.
We found out that
they're not just the largest
tenants in the building,
but also they own
15% there.
They don't only represent
these big stars, all right?
These guys have a vested
interest in this building.
Not only that, we found out
some juicy information.
They're about to merge
with another big law firm
that handles
even more big clients,
which is going to make them
even more powerful...
What the hell is
juicy about that?
They're going to have
themselves a little party.
Okay?
A little celebration.
They're going to have some
powerful people there...
big managers, agents,
maybe some actors.
Some of the richest men in
the city are going to be there.
We're going to crash
the party, okay?
With volunteers.
But we need
to get in the building.
Can you imagine
their faces when...?
Wait. Listen to the man,
let him talk.
What's the point of this?
The point?
First of all, no one fucks
with the stars, right?
These...
that's rule number one.
I'm going to personally embarrass
the shit out of all of these attorneys.
You've just got to get me
into the building.
This is the biggest public event
we can... have had in years.
You understand?
We either win it all
or we lose it all,
and I think it looks
quite complicated.
Um-hm.
You know, I've something
to tell you about college.
I have everything ready.
I'll be able to pay the $1,600
by the deadline they gave me.
And I'll still have $125 left.
But if I don't pay on time...
the scholarship moves on
to the next person on the list.
But what are you
trying to tell me?
I'm not gonna do this.
What?
The truth is, Maya, that...
I don't want to
jeopardize my scholarship.
I don't want to lose it.
You know that I've been
killing myself
the last five years to get it,
and to lose it just like that?
I don't think so.
Just like that?
The way I see it,
our families can't afford...
to lose the money
we send them, either.
But, it's different, Maya.
I don't know about you,
but I think that...
if we don't do it in this way,
we'll be left with what we had.
Nothing's gonna happen.
But I'm not doing it
just for me, Maya.
I'm doing it for you, too.
Don't say that.
Why not, Maya?
You know I love you.
And I want us
to be together, Maya.
But I don't know
what I want.
What about Sam?
I like him.
He's cool, he's funny.
I'm learning from him.
He believes in something.
And he's also white.
Don't give me that shit.
I don't know what
you are thinking.
That's why you're doing it, right?
What was it that you said
when they fired Teresa?
"She looks like my mother. "
That's why I'm doing it.
I'm doing it
because my sister
has been working 16 hours
a day since she got here.
Because her husband can't
pay for the hospital bills.
He doesn't have medical insurance,
like 40 million people in this country,
in this fucking country!
The richest country in the world!
I'm doing it because
I have to give Perez
two months of my salary,
and I have to beg him for a job.
I'm doing it because we feed
those bastards,
we wipe their asses,
we do everything for them.
We raise their children,
and they still look
right through us.
And maybe one day I will
go to school too, you see?
But what good will it be if
I forget about everything?
Maya!
Maya!
- I'm a friend of Gavin's.
- Gavin? Sure.
Oscar, you have to secure
the fire exits, okay?
You have to leave them unlocked.
Ella, hold the elevator.
So when the guys...
you bring the guys in, okay?
So you meet Ella,
bring the guys in and that's it.
And you will be up there.
We're going to wait
for the guys upstairs.
This is the other thing.
I got the radio.
It's working pretty good.
So I will listen
to security guards,
if something happens, okay?
And I will let you know.
Beforehand, all right?
Benecio.
Big fan of his.
He's a nice guy, yeah.
Good actor.
Ladies and gentlemen,
if we could have your attention
for just a moment.
We'd like to thank you all
for coming today.
This is a big day
for both Ted and I,
bringing together
two separate firms.
A merger's always
a difficult process, but...
we seem to have
worked it through.
Indeed, we have.
It's a personal triumph
that after weeks
of intense negotiations,
we've finally decided
on whose name goes first.
My congratulations
to both of you.
My friend would like
to say a few words.
Would you mind?
This is a very special occasion.
It's a friend of Gavin's.
It's fine, it's okay.
Sure. Just a few words, though.
Introduce yourself.
Hello everybody,
my name's Sam.
I just want to say
that with unsurpassed brilliance,
you have represented
some of our best
and most talented actors.
At the same time
as you're negotiating
these multi-million dollar
contracts...
the janitors
in your building
earn less than
$12,000 a year.
So, allow me
to present to you
your golden turkey,
for the worst performance
by an attorney.
Yeah!
- There you go!
- Bravo!
That was great.
Wonderful.
We just want to make a point
that janitors in this building,
owned by this firm, make poverty
wages, and that's not fair.
They make $5.75 an hour.
I really appreciate
your having come.
- I would like to clarify this.
- I appreciate your sharing...
I have a little demonstration,
a demonstration that will help
ensure that you get the message.
It's free of charge,
pro bono, if you will.
- I think...
- We could demonstrate...
what a superior job
union cleaners can do,
so, enjoy the show!
We can do it!
We can do it!
Ernest, get the fuck
up here right away.
I need your people up here.
The fucking janitors are here.
...how the lawyers and business
executives who work in this high-rise
usually come and go
without much thought
for the people who sweep the floors
and empty the trash.
Tonight, they were
impossible to ignore.
They demanded
"Justice for Janitors"
outside a downtown high-rise
that was sold 15 months ago.
We pay 75%
of our wages in rent,
and then we have to buy food,
we have to buy clothes
for our children.
Management spokesman, Tony Rizzoli,
says the company
is taking a hard line.
These people
felt it necessary
to sneak into the building,
and disrupt the whole thing,
turning on vacuum cleaners,
yelling and screaming...
But it's a tough life
for unskilled laborers,
when there is no shortage of workers
willing to do their job for less.
The Angel company
has been going on for years...
There's never been a complaint...
I have to show you something.
Really.
...and, excuse me...
It's been going on for three weeks.
I'm sick of this.
No talks are scheduled,
and the union says
the protestors will be back.
Management says if there's
another trespassing incident,
they will be arrested...
Wait a second.
Wait... hold on, Maya.
No, I can't do this here.
Hold on. I'm going to get
into so much trouble
if I get caught.
You're a troublemaker.
Shit!
Aw, shit!
Shh!
I'm going to get in trouble
over this shit.
Hello, babies!
Everybody, line up.
Let's go.
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.
Line up.
- What's happening?
- Stand up!
Shit.
- What happened?
- All right, goddamn it!
You, Ben...
you, Ruben...
Dolores...
you, Juan...
Oscar...
and definitely your ass, Ella...
got two minutes to get your shit
and get the fuck out of here,
before I have you thrown out.
What are you talking about?
We haven't done anything.
You haven't done anything?
You let unauthorized people
into my building,
which is a violation
of company policy,
for which you can
be terminated...
which is what this is,
motherfuckers... termination.
It was you, you fucking bitch!
It was you, Marina!
I know it was you.
I'm fucking pregnant!
I'm not fucking crazy,
you bitch!
You are crazy!
I didn't say anything.
Take it easy,
take it easy.
They were not involved.
I did it.
Shut up, Maya.
No, I am telling you
that I did it.
Ruben wasn't involved.
He has nothing to do...
He's going to lose his scholarship,
so please...
I don't give a shit.
You did it? You can go, too.
You can go, too.
That's right.
You and all of them
get the fuck out of here.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't give a shit!
What have you done, Marina?
Why?
- Why would you do this?
- It wasn't me.
And keep your mouth shut,
please, Maya.
Okay, all right.
That's enough.
It's not. It's not.
And where is your sister Rosa?
I don't know
where is my sister.
She is taking care
of her husband.
So, what are you
talking about?
I would like to know,
why do you do that?
She's warn him.
I say the truth.
What are you talking about, Marina?
Tell us.
Explain it.
She phoned him.
She said she's sick.
And after that, she told him
who was involved.
Goddamn it, shut up.
What are you talking about?
- You're a fucking liar.
- It was she...
- Goddamn it, shut up!
- Ask him who's going to be
the new supervisor
of the new buildings.
What?! Marina...
- You're gonna believe her?
- It's going to be your sister.
- Please, believe me.
- Ask him.
- Perez...
- It wasn't me.
Okay, she is not the first time
she says something like that.
What happened
with my sister? So...
It's none of your business.
Yes, it is my business
because we are losing our jobs.
It's my sister. I did it.
I am telling you.
I want to know
the truth, that's it.
Ask her.
Ask your sister.
Fuck you.
- Get them out of here.
- You can't do this with people.
You bitch!
Why?
Ella.
Ella, your friend, Ella.
Dolores, Ben,
Ruben will lose
his place in college,
and he wasn't there.
Why don't you
shut the fuck up?
I won't shut up.
Dolores is pregnant.
Just shut up.
Anyway, they were gonna
lose their jobs.
It was just
a matter of time.
So it was you?
Of course it was me.
And I'd do it again.
I won't stand around
with my arms crossed
while my husband is dying waiting
to be seen on a waiting list.
Life is now, Maya.
Right now, stupid.
It's not a fucking
fairy tale, huh?
Why?
- Why what?
- Why did you sell us out?
- Why did you sell us out?
- You sold yourselves out.
You did it yourselves.
You alone.
You did it on your own.
We're always saying,
"We're gonna win. "
But when will we realize it?
When will we realize that they're
much stronger than us?
It's always been like that.
How many times
have we discussed it? God!
Pick up those clothes.
You're a fucking traitor, Rosa.
You're a fucking traitor, sis.
Really?
You think I'm a traitor?
You do, don't you?
You think that?
Even when I was
supporting everybody?
Sending money to you and Mama?
You think so?
When I was feeding
everybody?
Did you guys ever wonder...
how did Rosa manage
to send the money?
How old was I
when I got to Tijuana?
I was a little girl.
A little girl, right?
And you didn't even wonder
about how I did it.
What for? Rosa kept your mouths
pretty full.
You know how I did it?
Turning tricks.
I was a hooker.
What do you think about that?
- I didn't know.
- I was turning tricks, honey.
So that you guys
didn't starve.
For five fucking years in Tijuana,
every single night.
Just about every single night.
"Suck their dicks, Rosa. "
- I never knew that.
- "Fuck, Rosa. Fuck, fuck.
Come on, because your family
is starving. "
"Suck their dicks," right?
"Come on, come on!"
Sounds awful, huh?
Disgusting?
What do you think?
Nobody asked me, huh?
My dad leaves,
and who gets screwed?
Who gets screwed?
Rosa. Let Rosa
start fucking everybody.
I didn't know, Rosa.
Let her suck
everybody's fucking dicks...
blacks, whites,
sleazeballs, slimebags.
Let her fuck
everybody, right?
- But we didn't know.
- My husband gets sick,
and I have to fuck.
Whose turn is it? Rosa's.
Let Rosa pick up
all the pieces, right?
She has to be doing
everything all the time,
as if Rosa were an idiot,
fucking everybody, right?
So you had something to eat!
I hate the whole fucking world!
I hate it!
I've put up with it
all my fucking life!
I've been keeping it here,
in my own gut.
How do you like that, Maya?
Come on, come here!
- Rosa, I didn't know.
- I'm talking to you.
Do you know
how I got you your job?
Didn't you want
a job here?
"Come on, sis, get me a job,
because I can do everything. "
You know what I did?
Yes, honey, I had to fuck Perez.
- Don't joke about that.
- I fucked him.
I fucked him for you!
I fucked him for you!
Because I'm tired.
Tired!
All my life.
My husband gets sick, I go fuck.
- My dad leaves, I go fuck.
- I didn't know!
You want a job?
I go fuck. All the time!
Goddamn it,
I didn't know!
No? Everybody looked
the other way.
- I didn't know, Rosa.
- Now do you feel bad?
Do you feel bad?
I have a husband.
I have two kids. And what?
I'm a fucking whore, right?
That's what I am.
Because I did it in Tijuana,
I keep on doing it here.
How do you like that, Maya?
My own daughter,
my baby asks me where her dad is.
What am I going
to tell her, Maya?
I don't even remember his face.
I don't know who the
fuck is her father.
"You were born
in a brothel, honey. "
You are right, Maya.
I am a fucking traitor.
A traitor
who is lying to herself,
to my own family,
to my baby girl.
Rosa, what did we do to you?
What did you do to me?
I didn't know.
Sir, can I use the restroom?
- To your left, in the back.
- Thank you.
- Don't lose it.
- No, no.
Sir! There's a body!
Oh, my God!
Where's the body?
What body?
Hey!
Shit!
Hey!
Open the fucking door!
Hey, listen, lady...
you'd better open up
this door,
I'm going to tell you
right now,
or you're in big trouble!
Open this door!
Oh, my God!
There is a man, a pervert,
in the ladies' rest room.
- He's got his pants pulled down.
- He's got his pants down?
- Yes, it's horrible.
- All right, calm down.
- You call the police.
- Thank you.
I'll kick his ass.
All right?
- Eh, buddy!
- What?
- Pull up your pants.
- Pull up my...?
What are you doing
with your pants down?
What the fuck are you...?
Open this door!
The police are on their way.
Pull them up.
What's that?
Check it out.
Is this a joke or what?
You start on September 12th.
How did you manage
to get all that money?
Don't ask.
Listen...
If you don't become the most
important attorney in this country,
I will never forgive you.
Wow.
Oh...
I don't know,
what to tell you, Maya.
Go to school.
Thanks.
You want to have
dinner tonight with me?
- Tonight? Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Of course. Where?
- At my house.
What are we doing?
Pizza?
No, I'm going to cook.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
We want bread,
but roses, too!
Down with exploitation!
No justice, no peace!
Okay, okay.
All right.
All right. Wow.
Okay, listen up.
Today is a great day for
the janitors in this building.
All right?
But we have to let the owners
of this building know
that this is going to continue
until they get
their jobs back. Right?
Yeah!
Okay, okay.
In the past few months,
I've seen you insulted, okay?
I've seen you
fired from your work,
I've seen you go through
financial crisis with your families.
There's been threats
of deportation.
I've seen friends split up
because of betrayal. All right?
I salute your courage,
'cause it takes a lot of it.
Now, we're fighting
for health care, right?
Yeah!
For respect at work.
Yeah!
We want bread,
but we want roses, too.
Yeah!
We want all the
beautiful things,
all the beautiful
things in life.
You see that banner?
That banner dates back to 1912,
from Lawrence, Massachusetts,
when 10,000 immigrant workers,
who were mostly women,
had to fight against poverty wages.
And it was a violent,
and a long dispute,
but you know what happened?
They won. They won, okay?
No one's giving you
roses for nothing.
Okay? No one.
You know when you get roses?
When you stop begging...
and you organize.
That's it.
And you form
a labor movement
that is strong enough to compete
against these powerful companies
that are controlling our lives.
Okay? Stand up
for your fucking rights!
Yeah!
Okay.
Can I have
your attention, please?
You have 30 seconds
in which to disperse.
Not even by the police.
We shall not be moved.
Not even by the police.
We shall not be moved...
Listen to me.
You people are trespassing,
you are violating the law.
You will have to disperse.
You have 30 seconds
to leave the building.
Do you have any
medical problems?
Stand right there.
Search her and take off
the cuffs for me, please.
- Are you sick, ill or injured?
- Can you spread your legs?
Come on, sit down.
Okay, who's Jose Ramirez?
Jose?
What's your name, sir?
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Emiliano Zapata.
Augusto Sandino.
What's your name?
Pancho Villa, Jr.
Give me your right thumb,
like this.
Come on over to your right.
I want you to look straight
at the ceiling, please.
Did you fill out a
"No money" slip?
Yeah, I put it in
with the booking.
Oscar?
- These are the last two.
- Come on.
All right!
What's happening? Hey!
...finally get us out of here.
Which one can you sing best?
You, come here,
take a picture.
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, listen up.
Listen up.
Listen up!
- Angel wants to settle.
- What?
Angel wants to settle.
Hold on.
Everybody's been reinstated.
You've all got your jobs back.
They're going to give you
health insurance, holidays...
We have won!
We have won! It's over!
How is it?
How is it?
I don't know.
We can do it!
We can do it!
The detectives
need to see you.
Listen, the detectives
need to talk to you.
Your prints match those
for a felony robbery suspect.
What's up?
Where are you taking her?
I don't know.
Excuse me, officer,
what happened?
Doesn't look good, man.
They made her prints
at the scene of a robbery
of a gas station.
That can't be true.
Come on.
Do you have any relatives
living in the United States?
My sister.
- And what's her status?
- I'm sorry?
Is she legal?
Does she have papers?
Yes, yes.
Mother's maiden name?
Hernandez.
Ma'am, you must sign
this form, right here.
You're going to be taken
to the Tijuana border.
If you re-enter
the United States,
you will be prosecuted
for grand theft
under Section 47
of the penal code.
If convicted, you'll be subject
to a maximum prison sentence
of three years in state prison.
Do you understand?
Understand?
You know, this is the
United States government.
We're going very easy on you.
Consider yourself lucky.
Rosa!
Rosa!
Leave her alone.
- Rosa!
- Rosa!
Come here!
Hey, here they come.
Oscar.
Where's Maya?
I don't see her.
Maya's not there.
- There she is!
- Here she comes.
We're with you, Maya.
Don't worry, honey.
Hi, Maya!
Here we are.
Maya!
- Bye.
- Bye.
Take care.
Take care of yourself.
I love you.
