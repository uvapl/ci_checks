Ladies and gentlemen,

I've traveled over half our state to be here tonight.

I couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in

at Coyote Hills and I had to see about it.
é‚£å£äº•ç°åœ¨æ—¥äº§ä¸¤åƒæ¡¶æ²¹
That well is now flowing at 2,000 barrels
æ¯å‘¨éƒ½ç»™æˆ‘å¸¦æ¥äº”åƒç¾å

and it's paying me an income of $5,000 a week.

so, ladies and gentlemen,
if l say l'm an oilman, you will agree.
ç°åœ¨ï¼Œä½ ä»¬æœ‰äº†ç»ä½³çš„æœºä¼š
Now, you have a great chance here,
ä½†ä¸€ä¸å°å¿ƒè¿˜æ˜¯ä¼šèµ”å
‰æœ¬é’±
but bear in mind you could lose it all if you're not careful.
åœ¨æ‰€æœ‰å‡¿äº•ç¢°è¿æ°”çš„äººä¹‹ä¸­
Out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots,
ä¹Ÿè®¸20ä¸ªæœ‰1ä¸ªèƒ½æˆä¸ºæ²¹å•†
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.
å‰©ä¸‹çš„éƒ½æ˜¯æŠ•æœºå®¢
The rest will be speculators,
æ‰€ä»¥æ‰æœ‰äººä¼šä»‹å
¥ä½ ä»¬å’Œæ²¹å•†é—´
that's men trying to get between you and the oilmen
èµšå–é‚£äº›åŸæœ¬åº”å±äºä½ ä»¬çš„é’±
to get some of the money that ought, by rights, come to you.
å°±ç®—ä½ ä»¬æ‰¾åˆ°çš„äººæœ‰é’±åˆæƒ³å‡¿äº•
Even if you find one that has money and means to drill,
ä»–ä¹Ÿå¯èƒ½å¯¹äºå‡¿äº•ä¸€æ— æ‰€çŸ¥
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.
é‚£æ ·ä»–å°±å¾—é›‡è¯·äººæ‰‹
He'll have to hire the job out on contract,
æ¥ç€ä½ ä»¬å°±å¾—æŒ‡æœ›åŒ
å·¥
and then you're depending on a contractor,
ä»–çš„åŠ¨ä½œä¿è½çº¯ç†Ÿ
who'll rush the job through
æ‰¾æ–°å·¥ä½œå°±è·Ÿä»–çš„åŠ¨ä½œä¸€æ ·å¿«
so he can get another contract just as quick as he can.
è¿™ä¸€è¡Œå°±æ˜¯è¿™æ ·
