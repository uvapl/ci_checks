To those who appreciate
WISTERIA  AND  SUNSHINE
Small medieval Italian Castle
on the shores of the mediterranean to
be Let Furnished for the month of
April. Servants remain.
Write Box Z 1045. The Times E.C.4
Thanks, ma'am.
To wounded soldier - sixpence.
Are you reading about the castle
and the wisteria?
What? Uh, yes. Why?
It just... it seems so wonderful,
and it's such a miserable day.
Perhaps that's why
it seems so wonderful.
No, no, it is so wonderful.
Wonderful, yes, but that is not worth
wasting one's time thinking about.
No, it isn't. I...
I believe we are neighbours.
I see you every Sunday in church
er.. Chapel Street, Hampstead
but we've never actually spoken.
I'm Mrs. Rose Arbuthnot.
Oh, thank you.
I'm Lotti Wilkins...
Mrs. Lotti Wilkins.
I don't suppose
that means much to you.
Sometimes it doesn't
mean much to me, either, but...
I am Mrs. Wilkins.
I'm sure you are.
I've never really liked the name
Wilkins very much.
It's such a small name...
with a mean little
twist at the end, you know.
"Kins". "Kins".
It's like a pug dog's little tail,
but it is Mellersh's name.
Mellersh Wilkins is my husband,
so I'm stuck with it.
Um, he's a solicitor.
He's very handsome.
That must be nice for you.
Why?
Well, um...
because beauty... handsomeness
is a gift from God,
like any other. And...
if used properly,
it can be, well...
Why don't we...
Shhht.
Why don't we try and get it?
-Get it?
-Yes!
Not just say
how wonderful it would be
and then go back to Hampstead
without doing anything about it.
As we have been doing
for years and years and years.
But how do you mean, "get it"?
Rent it. Hire it. Have it.
The castle. The wisteria. Everything.
-You and me?
-Yes. We'll share.
That way it will only cost half,
and you look as though you
wanted it as much as I do.
You look so beautiful and so sad.
I'm not sad...
It's my face. I can't help it.
My husband says I have the face
of a disappointed Madonna.
He has a way with words.
My husband never says a word
too much or too little.
Sometimes I think he keeps copies
of everything he says.
It's very disheartening.
If you wish for something
hard enough, it happens.
We hardly know each other.
But, if we were to go together
for a whole month.
I have a small nett that I
saved for rainy days.
This is a rainy day, isn't it?
Lotti, I've told you before
about buying flowers.
They are an extravagance
of the most blatant kind.
They always die, Lotti.
Then you have to buy more.
I know, Mellersh, but I like
the colour, and...
We're not rich, Lotti.
I own no stocks and shares.
What would happen to you
if tomorrow...
I were to be knocked down by a tram
and you were still buying flowers?
We have to watch every penny, Lotti.
I understand, Mellersh.
You are still recording every purchase
in that book I bought you, I hope?
Yes. Even the flowers.
Good.
Now...
about the party...
we should arrive at, um...
8:40, I think.
Yes.
8:30 is too early.
We'd look too eager.
8:45...  too late...
as if we're not interested.
Well, 8:40 it is.
Can't I stay at home, Mellersh?
All these artists. There are
so many in Hampstead and...
I never know
what to say to them.
Praise them, my dear. Praise
them, and you can't go wrong.
But no one will know
I'm there even if I am.
I'm sure your sister won't mind
if I don't turn up.
But I would.
As a family solicitor,
I have to be seen as a reliable
family man... with wife. So...
if by chance the people
 I meet at this party, have become
discontented with their solicitors, they
will exvocate themselves and join...
Bartleby... Bartleby,
Bartleby and Wilkins. For good!
Excellent sole, my dear.
Mellersh, I've been thinking...
have you noticed the um...
terrible weather, and I wondered
I you would mind...
-Um?
-...apple dumplings.
Would you mind some
apple dumplings.
Mind?
No, I love apple dumplings.
You are serving all my favourites
tonight.
You haven't finished your sole.
-I am not hungry.
-No. I'll have it.
Temptations, friends.
The devil never sleeps
when it comes to temptation.
Of course, II Peter 2
verse 9 tells us,
"The Lord knows how to deliver
the godly out of temptations,
but he doesn't always bother".
We should get away for a whole month.
From everything... to heaven.
Did it occurr that heaven is not
somewhere else? It's here. Now.
It isn't me.
Heaven is with God. You see, heaven
is within us and in our homes.
Not in mine.
What do you do? Is it you?
It's too late!
I do. And I do make it.
And it just isn't.
I see us, you and me, this April
in that castle by the sea.
I'm certain of it.
Have you ever seen things in a
kind of flash before they happen?
Never.
I'm sure it must be wrong to go on being
good for so long and become miserable.
I can see you've been good for
years and years, and you aren't happy.
And... I've been doing things for other
people ever since I was a little girl,
and I don't believe
I'm loved any better.
Are you all right?
You must believe...
I've never spoken to anyone
like this in my life.
I don't know what's come
over me.
It's the advertisement.
Yes... and us being so miserable.
There's no harm in simply...
asking about it, is there?
Hello, my dear.
You waited up.
I want to talk to you, Frederick.
I've made you something.
Thank you.
I had enough at the reception.
Yes, I can see.
After all, it was for my book.
You should have been there, my dear.
I missed you.
-I wonder.
-Of course I did.
I thought about us in Vienna.
Do you remember Vienna?
Or was it Prague?
It doesn't matter.
The golden rule is, if you've got
yourself in a hole, stop digging.
Drink your milk, Frederick.
It'll settle your stomach.
What do you think?
-People seem to like it.
-Frederick...
no one should ever write a book
God wouldn't like to read.
It's the way I earn a living.
Out of the immorality of fallen women.
They are dead.
Sin never dies, Frederick.
That's rather a depressing thought.
Anyway, I know your views,
so I've always been very careful.
You are married to
Frederick R. Arbuthnot, gentleman.
Gerald Arundel wrote
this and all the others.
Nobody knows it's a pseudonym.
God knows.
God must know an awful lot.
Why doesn't he do something?
Frederick, I'm thinking
of taking a holiday in Italy...
this spring, with a friend.
It's a splendid idea.
Yes, that's what I thought
you'd say.
It's just what you need.
-And for the money...
-I shall be using my own, Frederick.
You only have to ask.
Actually, it all works out
rather well, because...
I shall be out and about
promoting my book.
And of course I shall be starting
the next one:
Theodora, The Slave Princess.
Do you think we should
go on with this?
Sixty pounds, Lottie!
For 60 pounds, plus fares, plus
expenses for food and such like...
we could buy a great many boots
for the poor with that money.
We could advertise
for two ladies to join us.
That way it would only cost
15 pounds each. Plus expenses.
There's something
immoral about all this.
Oh, no.
No, thank you. No.
Excuse me, Mr. Briggs.
We've come in answer
to your letter about renting...
-the castle in Italy.
-Oh, I do beg your pardon.
I am very sorry,
do come in, ladies.
I'm very sorry about the mess,
um.. off in a couple of days..
business, I'm afraid...
to Germany, uh, France and Italy.
Here's my card.
But my real love is the, uh... oboe.
Do you play anything?
The pianoforte.
That's a ticket to the opera,
Mr. Briggs.
I do beg your pardon.
I played the flute when
I was at school.
I've always thought of myself
as a fluty kind of person.
Mr. Briggs, we sent you a letter about
renting the castle and you sent us this.
Er, I am mrs. Arbuthnot and this is
mrs. Wilkins.
Oh, I see. And er... are the terms
satisfactory?
-Yes.
-Well, then it's er.. it's settled.
Is it.. or.. em..
I think I can waive.. references mrs.
Arbuthnot...
I mean, er, have a good point.
Sixty pounds?
Oh, in cash.
Well, uh, Mrs. Arbuthnot,
cheques are more usual, but, uh...
however, I'm richer, and you're happier.
And I've got the money, and
you've got San Salvatore,
and I think I know which is best.
Well, um...
now, here are...
all the details... there...
yes, there we are... plus...
photographs... there we are.
And the er.. spare key...
and I'll give you a receipt.
Your, um...
your husband is going
with you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?
No.
No. I'm... I'm sorry.
I'd no right to...
I do understand...
sad times...
the war...
Thank you, Mr. Briggs.
Well, I think you'll fit in
very well at San Salvatore...
there are several portraits
of you on the walls.
Portraits of me?
Madonnas... exactly like you,
Mrs. Arbuthnot.
Are they looking disappointed?
No more than usual.
Rose.
Rose, we've done it!
We've done it!
You would've thought that
hundreds would have jumped...
to the chance of sharing a month's
peace and quiet in San Salvatore.
I can't understand why
we've only had two replies.
That does not leave us much choice.
I knew them all, you know.
Dear Alfred Tennyson,
who pulled my pigtails
and said they were too long.
And I sat on Mr. Carlyle's knee.
Oh, how he scowled.
I'm a perfect sharer of your
holiday, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
All I wish to do is sit
in the shade
and remember better times
and better men.
I'm very fond of flowers, too,
and from what you tell me...
in your advertisement,
San Salvatore will be perfect.
I remember spending a weekend
with my father at Box Hill.
Who lived at Box Hill?
George Meredith... the novelist.
Did you know Keats?
Keats?
No, I didn't.
And I didn't know Shakespeare
or Chaucer either.
Oh, no, of course not.
It's just that, um...
it's just that they're
immortals, aren't they?
And I've always thought
of immortals as being...
um, well... immortal -
not having died.
I mean, they're alive, but they're
dead.. and and alive. It's odd.
Very odd.
I thought I saw Keats the other
day - What? - in Hampstead
crossing the road to
his house where he lived.
It was about teatime...
Well, Mrs. Fisher,
time we were going.
I really did see him,
he was dressed in...
I hope you're not in the habit
of seeing dead people,
however distinguished.
It's not in the best of taste.
I'm sure the last thing
I would want to see
is my late husband, Mr. Fisher
crossing the road...
in front of my house.
I'm sure.
Well, Mrs. Fisher, everything
seems in order.
Provided your references
are satisfactory.
Our references?
Aren't we the ones that ought to be
asking references from you mrs Fisher?
These should be satisfactory.
A president to the Royal Academy,
archbishop of Canterbury...
the governor of the Bank of England.
I have known them for years.
I don't think references are very
nice things amongst decent people.
I mean, we're not business
men are we? They...
have to distrust each other.
Mrs. Wilkins is right, Mrs. Fisher.
References do bring a certain...
atmosphere into our plans
which isn't... quite what
we want,
so I don't think we'll take
up yours,
or give you ours.
In which case I shall assume
that you don't wish to join us.
Well, very well.
No references.
Yeah, I waive all references.
There... forgive me if
I don't see you out.
Lady Caroline Dester.
Ooh, she sounds very grand.
Very smart.
Do you see her with us
at San Salvatore?
I'm Caroline Dester.
I'm Mrs. Arbuthnot,
and this is Mrs. Wilkins.
How do you do?
Do sit down.
Thank you.
You realise it will be very
quiet at San Salvatore.
Nothing. No one.
Just the waves.
It sounds like heaven.
I'll be in Italy, which I love,
and not in a hotel, which a loathe.
The best of all, I won't be staying
with friends, I'll be with strangers.
Wonderful.
Why is that so wonderful?
Well, you won't be able to
mention a single person I know.
You don't know anyone
I know, do you?
No, I don't think so.
Nor do I.
Good. It's so boring otherwise.
It's no holiday to talk about the
same old things, same old people.
I want to just sit and not talk
and not think and not be the
center of everything all the time.
You know what that's like.
No, I don't.
Neither do I.
Well, it's very wearing.
Everybody makes demands...
especially men.
Yes.
-Caroline, darling...
-Yes?
-Delightful party.
-Thank you.
Now I'm not sure if you
really deserve it.
And this one I have inscribed
with a personal message for you.
Oh, thank you so much.
Now, I would rather
like you to meet my...
Excuse me, I'm just going to
have a word with your daughter.
Gerald.
Congratulations on the book.
Thank you, Caroline.
Your mother has been most
generous in setting this up.
-You look lovely.
-I know. Thank you, Gerald.
You mustn't monopolise Caroline.
It isn't fair.
Even though you are the
guest of honor, er.. Mr. Arundel.
You're going away, I hear.
Who's been talking?
-Authors have ways.
-Was it mother?
My lips are sealed.
I need to get away.
Where are you going?
If I told you, I wouldn't be
getting away, would I?
It's a secret, is it?
And please don't try
and find out, Gerald.
No, no.
(Why don't you go home?)
I just must have some time alone.
Frederick?
Good night, my dear.
Splendid, my dear.
The apricot tart
was especially fine.
Mellersh!
There's something
I want to talk to you about.
There's something I want to
talk to you too about, my dear.
I'm thinking of taking
you to Italy for Easter.
What?
I'm thinking of taking you
to Italy for Easter.
Frankly, I can afford it.
The company is doing very well,
thanks, I may say,
with all due modesty,
to my efforts.
I thought Italy rather than Switzerland
which is vile in April.
We could both do with a change.
It would be nice to go together.
A second person is always useful
in a country whose language
one doesn't speak...
to look after the luggage while
one communicates with the natives.
You seem stunned, my dear.
I am.
Yes, well, you don't seem
very enthusiastic about it.
It... it really is the most
extraordinary coincidence, Mellersh.
Really extraordinary.
You see... I've been invited
by a friend
to spend April with her in Italy.
She has a house there.
What?
Well, a kind of castle, really...
so I said yes.
This is outrageous, Lottie.
You accepted an invitation from
a friend without consulting me?
-I'm consulting you, now!
-Of course you can write to her...
and say you can't go...
it's absolutely out of the question!
-I can't do that!
-Why not!
Because I don't want to!
I'm afraid it's all settled, Mellersh.
-I can't go back on my word now.
-That's all settled? Nothing's settled.
I don't believe a word of it.
A friend with a castle in Italy?
What friend?
You haven't got any friends,
as far as I know.
Rose Arbuthnot.
Rose Arbut... I never heard
of Rose Arbuthnot!
Gosh, she's very nice.
Everybody says so.
Tell me if you'd like another
helping of apricot tart.
No, I would not like another
helping of apricot tart!
Lottie, you are not going
to Italy alone. Absolutely not!
How is this different?
Well, this is Italian rain.
There's no one here to meet us.
We are four hours late.
Stop, thief!
Madame...
Madame... English madame!
San Salvatore?
San Salvatore!
San Salvato...
Oh, Lottie, Lottie...
-It's all right!
-San Salvato...
They must have sent it!
What?
Madame... English madame,
San Salvatore!
O, buono cavalino, bello cavalino!
My horsey, good horsey.
Buono! Buono!
We're in God's hands now.
Sono cintato. Sone quattro ore
che a vi aspette. Preciso.
Io sono Domenico. Siamo
arrivati a San Salvatore. Scendete!
Beppo! Svegliati.
Prendi la valise, camina.
We have no choice, Lottie.
Ecco, ci qua.
Questo e San Salvatore.
San Salvatore!
San Salvatore!
Do you suppose it's all real?
Were you ever in your
whole life so happy?
Never.
I promised myself the first thing to
happen in this place would be a kiss.
Oh, it's a mirage.
No, it's her.
Oh, I didn't know she'd
arrived already.
Neither did I.
She'll get a headache, sitting in
the sun like that without a hat.
-She's treading on lilies.
-Well, they're hers as much as ours.
Only a quarter of them.
-Hello!
-Hello.
I got here yesterday.
Oh, what a pity.
We were going to choose
the nicest room for you.
Oh, I've already done that.
At least, I think it's the nicest.
We were going to make it pretty
for you with lots of flowers.
Oh, Domenico has done that.
I told him when I got here.
He's the gardener.
Well, it's good to be independent
and to know exactly what one wants.
Oh, it saves time.
But you shouldn't be too independent,
that people cannot be generous.
You know, I hadn't realised
you were so pretty.
That's very kind of you to say so.
You're really quite lovely.
I hope you make the most of it.
Yes, I've been making the most of it
ever since I can remember.
Because it won't last.
I know.
I musn't miss breakfast.
Buon giorno.
Eh spero che a dormito bene.
La prossima corta e di la,
il camero da pranzo eh...
di, Stefano!
Oh, there you are.
Oh, we had no idea you
were here.
Oh, yes, I'm here.
Cuckoos.
What?
Nothing.
I was just thinking about cuckoos
for some reason.
Uh, tea or coffee?
Er... Coffee.
Un poco di latte per favore,
Francesca.
Uh, Lady Caroline's Italian
is much better than mine.
My Italian is the Italian of Dante.
Very old-fashioned.
I was taught it by
Mr. Robert Browning.
Wonderful.
London doesn't exist anymore.
I suppose you realise
we've got to heaven.
Oh, grazie.
Well, I intend to spend most
of my time reading by myself.
Nobody wants to see an old
woman hobbling about everywhere.
Oh, I do hope your bedroom
is comfortable.
Oh, ... quiet.
It had two beds in it for some
reason, so I had one taken out.
Oh, so that's why I've got
two beds.
Well I've got two beds as well.
The second one must be
Lady Caroline's.
We simply asked Francesca
to take them out.
We didn't need them.
Neither do we. Do we, Rose?
Our husbands aren't here
to put in them.
In my day, husbands and beds were
rarely spoken of in the same breath.
Husbands were taken seriously,
as the only real obstacle to sin.
Would you like some more
coffee, Mrs. Arbuthnot?
Uh... no, thank you.
Would you?
No.
Now, have you all you want?
Yes, thank you. Have you?
Mrs. Arbuthnot...
you have the most interesting
habit of answering a question
with the same question.
Oh, no, no. Don't apologise.
I wasn't going to.
Well...
I'd better get on with my duties.
-What time would you like lunch?
-Lunch is at half past twelve.
Oh, I'll tell cook.
It'll be a bit of struggle, but I've
bought a little dictionary.
-Yeah, the cook knows.
-Oh?
-Lady Caroline has already told her.
-Oh!
She speaks the sort of Italian
cooks understand.
I couldn't get into the kitchen
because of my stick.
It isn't right.
Morally speaking,
Mrs Fisher is our guest...
we found San Salvatore...
it's silly as hat that we have
it this year, this place...
No... I think what gift it is to care.
I can't see the point of being
an old nostalgic...
at the price of one's liberty.
Oh. They must have signed heaven.
This is heaven. Isn't it Rose?
Yes.
I was just thinking. Mrs. Fisher
doesn't seem to be very happy.
We should try and help her.
Oh no, we musn't try to be or, well,
do anything in this place.
Oh, don't worry.
She'll be happy very soon.
Uh, you never give up, do you?
-Questa e per Lei, signorina.
-Grazie mille.
Il sole Lei va fare mal di testa.
-L'ho portato... un umbrellino.
-Grazie, è molto gentile.
-Domenico, vado a dormire.
-Brava.
-Dormire, e com'una rosa...
-Si dorma?
Si riposa.
I just want to get my feathers
smooth again.
Not spoken to, not grabbed.
If I can be left quiet for
one month,
forget things...
I might be able to get
myself straight.
Not on of them here...
Lax, lax...
Mi puo servire, Francesca.
Yeah, poco, poco.
Yeah, basta. Grazie.
Suona encora campanello, Francesca.
-Uh, are you all right?
-Yes.
-Did you hear the gong?
-Yes.
-I have a headache.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
Perhaps some tea might do
you some good.
No!
I expect what she really wants
is to be left quiet.
Yes.
But, I can't bear to think of you out
here with a headache. Perhaps I...
What she really wants
is to be left alone.
May I have the bread, please?
Do you know the Italian
for "aspirin"?
The proper cure for
headaches is castor oil.
She hasn't got a headache.
Carlyle suffered terribly
from headaches and neuralgia.
He always took castor oil.
What Lady Caroline wants is a dose.
Only one, mind.
It's a mistake to keep
on taking castor oil.
Do you know the Italian for it?
No, I don't think I do.
Castor oil isn't in classical Italian.
She hasn't got a headache.
Then why, pray, should she
say she has, Mrs. Wilkins?
Oh, she's... she's just
trying to be polite.
Soon she won't have
to try... she'll...
she'll just be
herself without trying.
Lottie has a theory about this place.
Yeah, I'm sure...
but I don't understand why you assume
Lady Caroline is not telling the truth.
-I don't assume, I know.
-And how, pray, do you know?
I saw inside her.
I hear you're not well.
I expect the journey's upset you.
Now, what you need is
a good dose
of some simple medicine
like castor oil.
Ah, I thought you weren't asleep.
Now, take my advice...
and don't neglect what might
turn into an illness.
-This is Italy.
-Don't worry about me.
I'm just lying here thinking.
Well, that's dangerous, too.
-I should go to bed and get well.
-I am well.
Then why did you send
a message saying you were ill?
I didn't.
Then I have had all the trouble
of coming out here for nothing.
Yes, but don't you prefer
coming out...
and finding me well than
coming out and finding me ill?
Well, you're a very beautiful ceature.
If you'd been born...
Fifty years ago, Lord Tennyson,
had an eye...
The beautiful, it seems...
are able to do just what
they like of men.
Yes, when you are beautiful
it's easier.
I wasted so much time
being beautiful.
Isn't this a delightful room?
We've just discovered it.
Well, really.
Why don't you like us being here?
I should have thought you
could see this is my room.
The notepaper.
That's my notepaper.
And the pen.
It's yours?
I'm very sorry. I...
I've been writing some
very nice things with it.
I don't think I've hurt it in any way.
But why can't we be here?
This is a sitting room,
and we've been sitting.
There's another one.
You and your friend can't
sit in two rooms at once.
And if I've no wish
to disturb you in yours,
you shouldn't disturb me in mine.
It's all right.
Soon you'll want us to share.
You'll probably even ask me
to use your pen if I haven't one.
I need a room to myself.
I'm an old woman. I can't
get about because of my stick.
I have to sit.
I want somewhere where
I won't be disturbed.
Mrs. Fisher, I assure you,
we have no intention...
We're only too glad for you to have
this room if it makes you happy.
We just didn't know about it,
that's all.
We wouldn't have come
in if we'd had.
Not until you invited us, anyway.
And you probably will do,
you know... very soon.
It isn't her room.
I've been thinking about Mellersh.
Why?
I've been a mean dog.
A... a what?
All this coming away and leaving
him in that dreary place
while I'm here enjoying
myself in heaven.
You know, he planned a holiday
in Italy with me,
and I planned a holiday
in Italy by myself.
I think he must be very hurt.
I've written and told
him everything.
Uh, you mean about the advertisement
and your nest egg?
Oh, no...
no I'll tell him about that
when he comes.
Uh, oh, when he comes?
I have written and
invited him to stay.
It's the least I could do.
It would be mean
not to share all this.
You think he'll come?
Oh, I hope so, poor lamb.
I see him here.
Lottie...
Lottie, I can't keep up.
The whole idea about coming
here was to get away,
wasn't it?
And now after just one day you want
 to write... to the very people...
to the very people we're
trying to get away from.
Yes, I know.
It's idiotic, isn't it, Rose? But...
I feel so happy here.
This place makes me
feel flooded with love.
The important thing is
to have lots of love about.
I was very stingy
with it back home.
I used to measure
and count it out.
I had this obsession
with justice, you see.
I wouldn't love Mellersh unless
he loved me back exactly as much.
And as he didn't...
neither did I.
The emptiness of it all.
I don't think I'll come
down to the village.
I'd like to stay here and think.
Don't think too long.
-Write and invite him now.
-Invite who?
Your husband!
Lottie can write, and
Mellersh will answer.
Frederick won't.
Or if he did, it would be,
"Thanks for the letter,
don't hurry back.
Say if you want money...
Frederick".
-That's a beautiful dress...
-No, I've had it a hundred years.
But you must be very cold in it.
It's easy to catch
a chill here after dark.
You look as though you have
nothing on underneath.
I haven't.
That's very imprudent
and very improper.
There are no men here,
so how can it be improper?
Have you noticed how difficult it is
to be improper whith no men about?
That's sad, but true.
I've had a wonderful day.
I've decided to invite
someone to stay here.
-What?
-I think he'll like it.
-Who?
-Wilkins.
-Well, that's your name.
-And his.
A relation?
A husband.
I thought you were
a war widow.
Why?
There are so many of them about.
When we were in London,
we agreed that we could invite
-one guest each, didn't we?
-I don't remember that.
I do, but it's incredible
you should want to.
I thought the whole idea was
to get away from one's friends...
-and husbands.
-And family affection.
-And lack of family affection.
-Really...
It wouldn't be so bad. It would give
a person room to breathe.
No. It would be terrible,
like having no clothes on.
-I like that.
-Really!
It's a good feeling,
getting rid of things.
But it's so cold having
nothing on,
and knowing that you'll never
have anything on again.
Don't you get colder
and colder...
until, at last, you die of it.
That's what it's like living with
someone who doesn't love you.
-Would you pass me the cream?
-But doesn't he love you?
Mellersh? He shows no signs of it.
Delicious!
Oh, really.
I didn't think it was delicious.
I was miserable, and then,
today, I got well.
I can't ever be happy
shutting him out.
I must share.
Now I know exactly what
the Blessed Damozel felt like.
-Who's the Blessed Damozel?
-It's a poem.
-I'll lend you a copy.
-Please, don't.
And the author, Mr. Rosetti,
though not all one would wish,
was frequently invited to
my father's house.
How terrible for you.
That's what my mother's always
doing, inviting authors.
I hate authors, don't you?
Me?
-Well, sometimes.
-I wouldn't mind them so much...
if they didn't write books.
-Do go on about Mellersh.
-Oh really.
Well, it's all these beds.
Eight beds and only four people.
That's dreadful.
I want Rose to invite
her husband here, too.
-Really.
-Really!
Sorry.
You do realise, of course,
that there is only one spare
bedroom in the house.
One?
Who's in all the others?
We are.
There are six rooms.
We have four.
Francesca has the fifth,
and the sixth is empty.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
I want to love Mellersh, but...
not necessarily spend
every night with him.
Where am I going to put him?
-Isn't one room enough for him?
-Yes, but...
then there won't be room left for
anyone that you may want to invite.
-Well, I shan't want to.
-No?
And Rose doesn't count.
She'd want to share
her room with her husband.
It's written all over her.
-Lottie!
-Really!
Really, what?
Just, really...
am I to understand
you propose to reserve
the only spare bedroom
for the exclusive use
of your family?
Mellersh isn't my family.
He's my husband.
Well, as nobody seems to want
the room, Mellersh must have it.
I have a friend.
Kate Lumley.
Perhaps you know her?
I wish to invite her to join me.
-That settles Mellersh, then.
-Oh!
Afraid you're in for it, Lottie,
unless, of course, he can't come.
No, no.
I... I see him here.
Why am I so restless?
I haven't felt this restless
since I was a child.
It's too absurd for
someone my age.
But look at me.
I can't keep still.
I feel... something is
going to happen.
But I won't let it.
I won't let it.
It's odd how one's mind slips
sideways in a place like this.
I walked without my stick today.
It's very strange.
If you knew me,
you'd know how strange it was.
You can talk to your Kate Lumley
about that when she comes.
Uh? Oh, no.
Kate would only look at me
and suggest a cup of tea.
I'm starving.
I've had another wonderful day.
Has the letter gone?
What letter's that?
Inviting your husband.
Oh, Lottie, don't.
Another one?
Who is her husband?
Mr. Arbuthnot, of course.
I mean what is Mr. Arbuthnot?
My husband.
They bring tra-la,
a summer of roses and wine,
a summer of roses and wine.
And that's what we mean
when we say that the thing
is welcome as flowers
that bloom in the spring...
Caroline's right.
Minds slip sideways.
How could I invite him?
What would we talk about?
The truth is...
I bore him.
And there's no way back.
No, if you bore somebody...
it's almost impossible
to unbore him.
..essun e caldo. Erania, vedera..
..si trovero bene qui signori..
Si la e securo.
-Is that Lady Caroline Dester?
-No.
Rose. Mrs. Arbuthnot.
Caroline'll still be in bed.
Caroline?
You call her Caroline?
I must say, Lottie, when
I got your letter
and found you were on holiday
with Lady Caroline Dester
I was impressed.
Isn't it beautiful here, Mellersh?
You know the Desters are one
of the richest families in England?
For once, Lottie,
you're being really useful.
The air is golden.
Now, first I think
I'll have a bath,
then a shave, then change my clothes,
have a sleep, and then I'll lunch.
Then you can introduce me
to Lady Caroline Dester.
I've planned exactly
what I'm going to say.
Mellersh, I do believe you came
all this way just to see Lady Caroline
and not me.
No. No, my dear.
No, no, no.
No. I came here to see you.
Oh, yes.
If, however, in so doing,
I can improve our business
prospects,
well...
Oh, I don't mind.
You're here.
That's the important thing.
And you'll change.
Signore, il bagno e pronto.
Si averse e pericoloso.
-E pericoloso! Vi attento eh.
-Yes. Yes.
Non spasa al bagna perche pericoloso.
Molto pericoloso!
-E pericoloso!
-Thank you very much.
Thank you. Out! Out!
Thank you very much.
I shall wash myself, thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.
That's it.
That'll be all.
Thank you.
Non devi chiudere l'aqua calda,
quanda e fini, capito? No!
There you are, there you are.
Thank you very much indeed.
That'll be all. Thank you.
Ahh... pericoloso, ahh...
Charming people. Charming! Ahh..
Blast that bloody bath!
-Oh, my God.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
-I'm Caroline Dester.
A.. allow me
to introduce myself.. er..
My name's Mellersh Wilkins.
I'm... I'm afraid I used
unpardonable language.
I thought it most appropriate
in the circumstances.
-Oh thank...
-Mrs. Fisher..
allow me to introduce
Mr. Mellersh Wilkins.
This is Mrs. Fisher.
Always a pleasure to meet
a friend of my wife's.
I... I was just taking a bath.
Oh, I didn't know...
'pericoloso' meant explosion.
Otherwise, I would've
remained dirty.
Oh, but now, Mellersh,
you look absolutely spotless.
You look clean enough
to eat dinner off.
Lady Caroline acted with true grace.
And Mrs. Fisher is remarkable,
too, in her way.
A woman of parts...
and property, if I'm not mistaken,
who may need my counseling.
Lottie, your friends are splendid.
Splendid!
Why you kept them
a secret is beyond me.
Signora, signora i conti.
della bottiglia.
E per la mangare, pregarli
pesce o uova?
Bisogna pagare i soldi di latte
di settimana avete guardari
Soldi, soldi, soldi.
Does this good Lady want something?
-Money.
-Money?
I think she's talking about
the housekeeping bills.
But you've nothing to do with
those. You're a guest here.
I'm afraid I'm not.
The four of us are sharing
the expense of this holiday.
I'm paying for my share
out of my nest egg.
You've every right
to be angry with me.
Nonsense.
Well... it's your money,
after all.
And you needed
a holiday like this.
Where else would you meet
such interesting people?
Oh, Mellersh, you really
are sweet.
Signora, signora,
soldi, soldi, soldi...
Mellersh, you belong here.
Non è corta linea,
non è corta linea...
Yes, this is the result of one week's
unbridled license, and it must stop.
.. Yeah Mr. Wilkins, I don't approve
of men smoking indoors.
-No, I thought you wouldn't.
-I'm searching that Lady Caroline girl.
-Ah, a most agreeable guest.
-Agreeable?
She's been letting the bills run
up in a most terrible fashion.
What has Lady Caroline
to do with the bills?
The housekeeping was left to her.
Lady Caroline housekeeping for
a party that includes my wife?
You render me speechless.
You do know she's the daughter
of Lord Dester...
the Lord Dester.
Ah! Well that accounts for it then.
The botch-up her father made in his
department during the war
was a national scandal.
They never could actually
prove anything.
You ought to have told me you
were not doing the household bills.
I didn't know you thought I was.
Now what do you propose we do
for the rest of the time here?
Nothing.
Nothing. Uh uh... nothing!
Uh, ladies...
May I make a suggestion?
Why not allow a certain
amount per head,
and tell the cook from that sum she
must cater for you as well as ever.
It's easily reckoned out.
The charges of a modest
hotel perhaps... halved.
-That's very sensible, Mr. Wilkins.
-So it is, but..
what about the terrifying bills
for this last week?
Don't worry. I'll pay them.
It'll be my present to San Salvatore...
I don't want Lottie worried in any way.
That is most generous of you.
Well, uh, if you wish to waste
your money... I agree.
Good.
Well, we needn't bother
Lady Caroline any further.
-Oh, really.
-Mrs. Fisher,
do tell me about Ruskin.
Ooh, you have an interest in Ruskin,
mr. Wilkins?
Indeed I do. I've met him ma'm,
but tell me, is he taught?
-What's his harp?
-Harp?
I like him.
I didn't think I would, but I do.
He doesn't hover, he doesn't grab...
he fits in.
I shouldn't write.
He won't come.
"What do I want with a holiday?"
This place is making me soft,
and work is the only salvation.
You know I won't post it.
Domenico can do it.
It's this place.
Different from Inverness Terrace.
Nothing young there.
I should take it loose.
This feeling unsubmitted
a birst out.
Absurd at my age.
Nothing personnel and crox
imagining we feel young again.
I won't have it,
I won't have it.
-Mellersh?
-Ah!
Thank you, my dear.
I've made up my mind.
I've decided to pay your expenses
for this holiday, as well as my own.
Your nest egg...
will not be touched.
Oh, Mellersh.
-How nice of you.
-Be careful, careful.
Now, I've realised how valuable
you are to me.
In my profession...
a man is always helped by having a...
a clever and... attractive wife.
Lady Caroline
thinks you're attractive...
and so do I.
Do you think I'm attractive, Mellersh?
Yes, I do.
One thing puzzles me, though...
Why weren't you attractive sooner?
I've been lucky.
All the advantages
I was born with,
and I've misused them.
Perhaps if Jack hadn't been killed.
No, no.
That's an excuse.
Thousands of women lost men in the war.
I should count my blessings.
So why aren't I satisfied?
I have it all.
Why can't I hold onto it?
He'll have got your letter by now.
I shouldn't have sent it.
Oh, no.
You'll get a message very soon.
saying he's on his way.
It works for you.
You have a gift for happiness.
Ahh, Mrs. Arbuthnot...
I was looking for you.
There's a telegram.
Rose?
Not bad news, I trust?
No, no.
On the contrary.
"I am passing on way to Rome.
Will pay my respects".
And who is George Briggs?
The owner. It's his house.
He's coming this afternoon.
He's very nice.
Mr. Briggs.
Oh. We didn't expect you so soon.
Yes, it really is extraordinary,
the likeness.
Oh, well, I hope I don't look
quite so solemn.
It isn't really so much like me.
Well, I can see deeper than
most. You're alike inside.
You and Lottie should get on very well.
She sees inside people, too.
La signora Fisher ha prendendi un caffe.
E sara molto, molto contenta di viderla.
Who's Signora Fisher?
One of the four of us
who are sharing your house.
Four?
Well, my friend and I decided
we couldn't afford it on our own, so...
Oh, dear. If I had known.
Come on. I'll introduce
you to Mrs. Fisher.
No. Won't she keep?
Won't you show me around first?
-It's your house.
-Well, no, it's not.
Well, until Monday week.
Come on, you show me all your
views, and I'll show you mine.
Careful, now. Here.
Ah, there we are.
What?
Why are you laughing?
-Uh, it's like coming home.
-Oh, but this is your home.
No no, I mean like coming
home to a family.
I've never had a family, you see,
I'm an orphan.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Oh, no, no, no.
I hope you haven't been one long er...
no, I mean, well...
I don't know what I mean.
No. I... I was adopted. Happily...
but I always missed... having a family.
And there's..
something about you that's
exactly my idea of a family.
You're so... warm...
Well, you wouldn't think so
if you saw my house in London.
There's nothing warm there.
Why,... not at all.
I'd believe any place you lived
in would be exactly like you.
You're not going to tell me
that San Salvatore is like me?
Well, of course.
I mean, you must admit
it's beautiful.
Here.
I've been thinking.
Isn't it better to feel young
somewhere
than old everywhere?
Time enough to feel old again
when we have to leave
this beautiful place.
Oh, good gracious.
Child,
Child.
Excuse me. Do you...
you remember me?
-Yes, of course, Mr. Briggs.
-Hello.
Yes, you must have some tea. I'll
get er.. Francesca to make some fresh.
Oh, hm... no. I'm sorry.
-I'm forgetting myself.
-Oh, it's very natural.
I... I'll go along and ask Francesca.
Oh, no. No, don't you go, um...
uh, Francesca,
ancora te, Francesca.
I was, uh, explaining, um, Mrs. Wilkins,
that I'm just on my way
to Rome, and, um...
I thought I'd just look in and
make sure you were all comfortable.
And where are you staying, Mr. Briggs?
At a hotel at Mezzago.
Well, no. You must stay here.
It's your home.
You can have Kate Lumley's room.
You wouldn't mind him using it
for one night, would you, Mrs. Fisher?
-Kate Lumley isn't actually in it.
-No, she isn't.
Uh, Kate Lumley is unfortunately
a very wide person,
and that's a very narrow room.
No. Kate might get into it...
but once in, she would
probably never get out.
So, you see, dear boy,
you must stay here.
Yes, you must.
Well, if you all agree,
I'd love to be a guest here,
especially with three such
lovely hostesses.
Uh, but there is a fourth,
isn't there?
Uh... yes.
You can ask her yourself,
Mr. Briggs.
Caroline, this is Mr. Briggs,
the owner.
We've invited him to stay the night.
-Yes, if there's room and...
-Oh, Lord, another man.
Looks like a grabber.
Grab, grab, grab.
There's Kate Lumley's room.
She's not coming, is she, Mrs. Fisher?
Well, not if I can help it.
Then I join in the invitation.
Well, thank you.
So we'll have another whole day to
explore San Salvatore, if you'll let me.
-I'd be delighted.
-Good!
Could you give me some
of those cherries, my dear?
You'd better get your things,
Mr. Briggs.
-Oh, yes... uh..
-Oh, we can easily send Domenico.
Well, only if you're sure it wouldn't
be any trouble, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
Mr. Briggs...
Do tell Caroline
about the oleander tree.
Oh, well...
yes, um...
uh, yes, you see this, uh,
oleander just here.
Well, my father...
uh, many years ago...
stuck his cherry-wood walking
stick into... uh...
that spot and said to the head gardener,
"this is where we'll have an oleander".
And he left it there
as a reminder,
and, uh, after a while,
uh, quite how long
nobody can be sure,
it, the stick, began to sprout.
And it was...
an oleander.
Is that true?
That doesn't matter.
It's such a pretty story.
Yes, it is.
He seemed very taken
with Rose.
He certainly didn't grab
like the rest of them.
I'm pleased.
Yes, I'm very pleased.
Of course I'm pleased.
Gerald?
Gerald Arundel. It can't be.
Oh, my goodness.
Caroline...
I didn't expect...
What are you doing here?
You must forgive me
dear Caroline.
Your mother told me
where you were.
As I happened to be passing
on my way to Rome,
I thought I'd get out at Mezzago
and just look in,...
see how you were...
if that's all right.
Didn't Mother tell you
I was having a rest cure?
Yes, she did.
That's why I didn't come earlier.
Left it till near dinner time.
Didn't want to intrude.
-I thought you might be bored.
-I'm not.
I do apologise
for barging in like this.
No, no. I'm rather
glad to see you.
-Tell me all about Mother.
-She's taken to wearing a wig.
A wig?
Blond.
She looks rather like Brunhilde.
I must run, or I'll never
be ready in time.
Don't worry about me.
I'd just like to have a sit
after that walk.
See you at dinner?
Frederick?
Frederick!
Rose.
I knew you'd come.
-When did you start?
-Start? Yesterday morning.
You started right away then.
Right away, yes.
You got my letter very
quickly, didn't you?
Your letter?
Very quick.
Sweetheart...
I'm so glad you came.
Oh, I am sorry. I... I didn't mean to...
Mr. Briggs.
Well, I'm damned.
This is my husband...
Frederick Arbuthnot.
I thought you were a widow.
No. Why?
Well, no, I thought, um...
well, so many women
seem to be...
Frederick, this is Mr. Briggs.
He owns the castle.
-How do you do?
-Oh, how do...
well, um...
We'd better go on.
come on.
We mustn't be late for dinner.
Like Caroline.
-Caroline?
-She's always late.
Lady Caroline Dester.
She's one of my friends.
Are you all right, dear?
Never better.
Of course, Mrs. Fisher,
it would be
undoubtedly best if one's
outward appearance
and one's feelings matched,
but so often they don't.
One can't have everything.
I, for example...
I am at the moment
feeling happy... joyful, even.
But do I show it?
I kept telling Rose you'd come,
didn't I, Rose?
You did.
I didn't believe it, but here you are.
You're right, Lottie. It's this place.
It's a tub of love.
What?
A tub of love.
Ah, this is Caroline.
I'm Frederick Arbuthnot.
Frederick Arbuthnot.
My name's Frederick Arbuthnot.
I'm Rose's husband.
I've just come down to see her.
Yes, yes, yes. Hmm.
How nice.
And I'm late on your very
first evening.
Do forgive me.
Isn't she beautiful?
Love!
Yes.
You know, it's a great thing
to get on with one's loving...
and not to waste time.
I suppose you think
Rose's husband is just a...
middle-aged, red-faced,
rather ordinary man.
He isn't.
-Isn't he?
-No.
Rose sees through all that.
She sees what we can't see
because she loves him.
Oh dear Lottie we must be
friends forever and forever.
Thank you for not, uh...
I don't know what you mean,
Mr. Arbuthnot.
I think Rose is waiting for you.
Frederick, how is your book then?
-My book?
-Umm, sounds exciting!
Theo, The Slave Prince.
Theodora, The Slave Princess...
can wait.
Oh, hello. Who's that?
-It's me. Caroline Dester.
-Ah!
-I hope I'm not disturbing you.
-Oh, no. No.
Forgive me...
I couldn't help noticing
how miserable you seemed.
Was it the unexpected arrival
of Mr. Arbuthnot?
Yes, uh.
I thought Mr. Arbuthnot
had, uh, died.
Well, so many men died.
Yes. So many.
Yes. It's, um...
Well, you may not have noticed,
but I'm rather shortsighted.
-Indeed?
-Well, the war...
-Does it give you any pain?
-On, no, no, uh...
Absolutely not. Nothing...
to it at all. But it uh..
it does rather mean...
I never get a...
good look at people,
you know...
they all seem rather
hazy somehow.
I tend to judge people
by their voices, you know,
the inside person,
and er...
and it did rather seem to me
that Mrs. Arbuthnot was...
wonderful... inside.
Wonderful inside?
Yes! That's important.
Yes.
Oh, what the devil.
It's too beautiful a night
to be miserable.
-Though I do miss the stars.
-No! Oh, sorry.
I had to grab you.
All my dead friends don't seem
worth reading tonight.
They always say the same things...
good things, but always the same.
They were... they are... great,
but they have one
terrible disadvantage...
they are all dead.
I'm tired of the dead.
I want the living.
Thank you, my dear.
I was feeling
a little melancholy.
Where are the others?
They all seem to have
paired off, Mrs. Fisher.
It does seem that...
people can only
be happy in pairs,
all sorts of pairs.
Then you and I will be
a pair, Mrs. Fisher.
We're going to be very
good friends.
I hope so, Lottie.
I can see it.
Then we will be.
Where exactly are the others?
Well, the Roses are in love
in the Rose garden.
The Roses?
Why not call them
the Arbuthnots, my dear?
Very well, Mellersh...
Arbuthnots.
And the Carolines...
...the who?
Oh, the Briggses, then.
The Briggses?
Oh, are you mad?
They never set eyes
on each other before today.
That's why they're
able to go ahead.
Go ahead?
It's no use, Mellersh.
I see them as the Briggses.
You coming, my dear?
It's so sad to leave here.
Lottie, Lottie, just
a moment, my dear.
-You go on.
-Are you sure you're...
You go on ahead, and I
will join you presently.
All right. See you
down there.
Mind your step here.
Such a beautiful place.
Marvelous.
-One last note.
-Alright. Ooh.
Per favore, Domenico?
Grazie.
Mrs. Fisher!
Come on!
Prego, signora...
That last week,
the whole country seemed
to dress itself in white.
There were white lilies,
white stocks,
white banksia Roses,
and the fragrance of the acacias.
Even after we'd got to
the bottom of the hill
and passed through the iron
gates and out into the village,
we could still smell the acacias.
We could smell them even
when we reached London.
But that's another story.
