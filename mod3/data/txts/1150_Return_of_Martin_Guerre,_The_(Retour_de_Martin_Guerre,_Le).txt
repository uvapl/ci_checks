THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE
On this St. Michael's Sunday
in the church of Artigat...
...we receive
Bertrande de Rols...
...daughter of the late
Laurent de Rols and of...
...Raimonde, his wife
And we receive Martin Guerre...
...son of Mathurin Guerre...
and of his wife, Brigitte,
Martin wishes to take Bertrande
for wife...
and keep her all his life
I, Martin, give my body to thee,
Bertrande
I accept it and give my body
to thee, Martin
I unite you in the bonds
of holy matrimony
You will not regret
having followed this story...
...for it is not a tale
of adventure...
...nor an imaginary fable
It is a true story
It began one August Sunday,
in 1542...
...in the village of Artigat,
county of Foix...
...in the reign of Francis I
Bertrande, at her parents'
decision...
...brings a dowry of 30 acres
of wheat...
...and 40 of millet, at the place
called Pomarede
Also one pair of oxen
and the Roussas woods...
...inherited from her father
Laurent, deceased
Three dresses, one bed,
one linen-chest with lock and key
That's all
Catherine... something to drink
If you still agree, sign here
Seraphin, you will have
to blow harder, boy!
It's a good match... well
arranged
May the Lord bless
this bed with health...
...and keep the Demon
from this house
Kiss her, Father
Martin, tender buds need
to be sprinkled at night!
You two... kiss your brother
Make us some pretty
grandchildren!
The rest... you can do without me
Whenever you want,
come eat and dance.
This is Bertrande de Rols
You say at first
your husband couldn't...
...consummate your marriage.
Why not?
Because of the spell
that had been cast on him
So your mother wanted
the marriage dissolved?
Yes... but I didn't
I was married...
I felt bound to him
People knew?
Of course... We had no children
They made fun of him?
Yes... the whole village
Tell me what happened that
Candlemas Day
If you're tired of sleeping
at night, change husbands!
Change husbands
if you want to have children!
Stop trembling, boy
It's caused by evil thoughts
They put a spell on you
I'll take it away
Blessed Flesh, I unknot you
Blessed Flesh, I unbind you
Blessed Flesh,
I make you grow again
Accursed Demon, leave
this servant of the Lord
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Martin...
...whose flesh is suffering
Merciful God,
shed Thy Grace on Bertrande...
...whose flesh is suffering
And put in all your heart.
Don't be afraid
I am Jean de Coras,
of the Toulouse Parliament
I am now in charge
of this matter
You must tell me everything,
even if the priest said not to
And that worked?
That very day... yes
We had a son... his name is Sanxi
So all was well
For me, yes, but Martin...
Martin kept to himself
He didn't even look at our son
He didn't like farming
He and his father argued
You want us to die of thirst?
Where were you?
You can't do anything right!
Iwas with some soldiers,
at the stream
2 sacks of grain are gone...
You seen them?
You stole them
You loaded the grain...
You stole them!
You stole them!
Our family doesn't steal!
I値l make you hate the
taste of bread!
Ididn't take them!
- While I'm alive...
...I'm the master here!
Look, Martin, aren't they pretty?
Wear them Sunday
You cut them too big.
You wasted your time
You always scold me
It's not my fault
Be nice sometimes
That was the night he left
Why steal the grain?
Did he know he was leaving?
And needed money?
Maybe... I don't know
He didn't talk to me much
What did you think?
That he'd be back soon
Everyone thought so
That his father had scared him
He waited for Martin
every day for months
Finally he died...
killed by sorrow
Martin's mother died
a year later
So Melusine married a prince...
...and all her sons
became kings
But one Saturday,
her husband couldn't resist
He peeked through the keyhole...
...and saw she was a mermaid...
...with scales on her body,
and wings on her back
Some people believe
she comes back every day...
...secretly, to feed the children
And I believe it, too
She couldn't desert them
Your mother got married again?
Yes... to Pierre Guerre,
my husband's uncle
To keep the farms together?
No doubt
Our lands are now held in common
The wolves are out tonight
Make sure the animals
are locked up
Yes, mother...
I do it every night
Dirty beast!
Did Martin stay away long?
Eight winters... or nine
You never heard from him?
No... nothing
But I'm sure you had
no lack of admirers
No... but I kept my virtue
Speak up, we can't hear you
I kept my virtue
Ask anyone... I remained chaste
You never forgot Martin?
Iprayed to St. Catherine
to send him back
So many seasons passed...
Then she heard me.
Who are you?
Do you have some water
for a thirsty man?
Who are you?
Don't you recognize me?
Look closely!
Do I know you?
- I think you do
Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son?
Is it you, Martin?
You're back!
And you're Jacques, Etienne's son
No, Jacques is my brother
Right... you're "Smallpox Andre"
Remember the bear hunt,
when Nicolas "castrated" me?
Made me miserable, didn't you?
Martin Guerre is back!
You're bigger, Martin
War does that
Martin Guerre is back!
You've seen him?
Yes! He's down the road
Guillemette... your brother!
Are you sure?
- I saw him!
Bertrande, your husband's back!
Come... it's your husband!
You still here?
Where've you been, Martin?
We thought you were dead!
Hello Jeanne... sister
Martin... at last!
You've changed!
Where's your husband?
Are you Guillemette?
You were so small when I left!
Come kiss your brother
Sanxi?
You're so big
Don't be afraid
Come nearer
I'm your father
Hello, Uncle
You were gone a long time
That's true
Forgive me for what I did
Your father and mother are dead
I heard, and I prayed for them
I also heard you
married Raimonde...
...my wife's mother
It's good news
My daughter has suffered
Have you changed for the better?
You're here... it's all true!
Is it really you?
Is that you, Catherine?
You haven't changed
I wondered if you'd ever
come back
And here you are, safe and sound
Where's Bertrande?
- At the wash-house
She's waiting for you
It's me, hello
It's me... Martin
Hello, Martin
My God, my wife is beautiful!
It is a gift of God
that you have returned
He was in the Army in Picardy
Don't you recognize me?
Who are you?
It's me... Nicolas
It's confusing, seeing you all
I forgot about the bear long ago
I've seen worse
Here's cloth from Flanders
The nicest for Bertrande,
with lace
Catherine, take the last one
You've learned to read?
And to write, too
To write?
What did you do all this time?
Ifought in the war
I even went to Spain
Then I wanted to see you
All of you
What's Spain like?
It's dry
And Paris? Did you see Paris?
It's big...
There are people everywhere
I even got lost there
There are thieves at night
You're so strong now, Martin!
Iknew my brother would come back
This calls for a celebration!
When you left here, Martin...
...you didn't have a beard yet
And you didn't drink as much
Now I drink like a monk!
After war... peace!
To you, my wife
A little rough... but not bad
Just enough to kill the worms!
I値l prepare your bed
It's good to be on your own land
What are you looking for?
The candles
In there
You moved them?
No, they've always been there
Then I forgot
She cried a lot because of you
Remember, Bertrande?
Go get my white breeches...
...the ones lined with silk...
...from the linen-chest
If they're still there
I'll go
You've found your smile
"The bird's back in the nest,
Tonight they will not rest"
They're still there
Waiting for you... like me
I'll wear them tomorrow
How often I've wanted you
I'm here only because of you
So everyone recognized him?
Yes... everyone
His sisters, his uncle...
...Catherine, the servant?
His friends... the whole village
You too?
Me too
Without hesitation?
Then what?
He took up his work,
his place at home
We had two children.
The first died...
...the second is alive:
A girl, 18 months old
And everything went well?
Very well
Better than before?
Yes... and he worked hard
Our harvests have never
been better
And between you two?
It's been good
When did the doubts first begin?
One day some vagabonds
slept in the barn
A game for 15 points?
Idon't gamble
Then buy a saint's image
or a holy relic?
Go to the devil,
we have a priest!
I知 going back
I'll play
Dominique, play with me
No, I think not... like Martin
Come on Father... only 15 points
Who is he?
Martin Guerre, who went away
and came back
Like the prodigal son
He's not Martin Guerre!
Iknew Martin Guerre
At the battle of St. Quentin
In fact, he lost a leg there
Of course it's Martin
I ought to know...
I'm the one who married him
But it's not! He's...
What's his name again?
Iknew him in the Army, too.
It is Martin...
we're even related!
Itell you he's not Martin
He's Pansette!
That's it... Pansette
He's from the village of Tihl
I knew him in Picardy, too
What's he doing here?
Isaw two of those people
in Arras
From a land called Brazil
Their bodies were all painted
They had feathers on their
heads... It's true, Sanxi
Feathers are for them
what silk is to us
They were in chains,
and made to dance
In their own country,
they go naked
Even the women?
Sounds like a nice country
Then you should go there
They eat their prisoner's hearts
And the prisoners consider it
a worthy death
Are they human?
Do they have a soul?
The monks say they do
In some tribes, they share
their land and their women
In others, the women go to war
and make all the decisions
The day women rule here,
it'll be the end of the world
Tomorrow we'll have a north wind
No... Let's go home, I'm afraid
Why?
See? A circle of smoke...
Spirits will be out...
We mustn't look at them
Pansette! What are you doing?
Leaving us already?
Trying to find your way?
When are you going?
Did you come to
the wrong village?
Imight've known it was you,
you snake!
He's strong! Not like Martin...
right, Bertrande?
Pansette, you look true
but you play false
Beware!
Where was this soldier from?
A garrison in Picardy
Don't believe tales told
by strangers...
...and by drunks
Or by rogues!
He's right
"Lies come easy from afar"
We know Martin well
If anyone knows Martin...
...it's us
We must do our accounts one day
How much my land earned
in my absence
What do you mean?
You worked my land and I'm
grateful... but it made a profit
Now I need the money
I figure it's about 6000 livres
You dare ask me
for an accounting?
I, who raised your son
while you roamed the world?
I, who protected your wife?
I, who welcomed you back
and forgave you?
It was your duty! Iwent
to war... I've a right to it!
You have no rights... you left!
Yes, I have!
Ihave the law on my side
I'll seek justice, if I must
You'll be condemned
You threaten your uncle?
Ineed that money!
I値l sell Gold Cross Field
and buy Pusol's...
...to plant barley
You want to sell
your father's field?
It's too steep for planting
You're starting to squander
our property!
But I expected it
I'm not surprised
I warn you...
...Martin or not Martin
...you won't get away with it!
What did you say?
Repeat that!
So Bertrande, you have
doubts too?
Know what they're saying?
You know that if this man
isn't your husband...
...you've been living in
mortal sin for three years
You know that
you're damning your soul
You'll follow him into
the depths of Hell
Your flesh will burn
Your eyes will fall
into the flames
You will scream but
no one will hear
An eternity of suffering
awaits you, Bertrande
Aren't you afraid to lie to God?
If you have doubts, why haven't
you told me, in confession?
You aren't hiding anything
from me?
Beware, Bertrande...
...of the day when the dead
come for the living...
...the Day of Judgment!
But when he came back,
you recognized him, too
The whole village did
You all welcomed him
Look at Bertrande
She's not complaining
She's never looked better
He'd been gone a long time
What if we were all mistaken?
He's changed a lot, hasn't he?
Reading and writing
lead to all kinds of mischief
You're right to stand up to him
I ask you again...
...what if it's not him?
You be careful, too.
After me, it'll be your turn
He'll wipe your ass
and take your shirt!
He'll pluck you clean
and go away again
Leaving you your eyes to cry with
Then you'll see what kind
of man he is!
The work isn't finished!
I知 ashamed for you, Uncle
My father wants you
I'm coming
What do you want?
I致e thought it over
You're right... I have the money
I owe it to you
and I'll give it to you
I don't want any trouble
Know where your father hid money?
No, he never told me
In the hay-loft above the stable
I'll wait for you there
at cock's crow
I'll give you your due
But let's keep it to ourselves
Their heads are empty
so they tell tales
They're all jealous
Seeing us happy
makes them piss vinegar
All they talk about is us
Calm down, my uncle has
understood... He'll shut them up
Give me your hand
Let me guide you
Is that her name?
Yes, that's my name
It's in the grain chest
You wanted it, right?
You wanted what we owe you?
You're going to get it!
Your money's worth...
...in hard cash!
You won't ask for it again!
At your service, Pansette!
Hit hard, he has a tough hide!
Go on, Antoine,
or I'll disinherit you!
You were ready to die for him?
Yes, to protect him
Explain something to me
You defended your husband,
risking your own life
But when his uncle
attacked him legally...
...you didn't say anything
You should've protested
Talked to the judge
Told everyone:
I know he's my husband
But you said nothing
Why?
Did you have doubts, too?
How could you, of all people,
have had doubts?
At one moment, I was troubled
I wavered
I thought...
Speak up
I thought: Maybe
he's fooling me, too
Charming me, as he did others
Then my daughter is a bastard
And I'm living in sin
and will go to Hell
Yes... I had doubts
And still have?
No, not any more
Then he is your husband
Yes or no?
I say yes
And what does he say?
The same thing, obviously
He says they're man and wife
It got so confusing,
I took it to the Parliament
They're all here
Come with us
Go join your family
You are Martin Guerre?
Yes, I am
You're quite sure?
I don't know of any other
You're going to pay!
You're an impostor!
You tricked us!
The law will punish you,
you cheat!
You tricked us,
to steal our property
Slander! To avoid paying
what you owe me!
I owe you nothing!
You're not my nephew!
I am and you know it!
Everyone knows it!
Eat your words!
The family apart... over here
Now listen to me, all of you
Those who honestly think...
...this man is not Martin Guerre,
to my left
Those who honestly think...
...he truly is Martin Guerre,
to my right
And you?
I am their priest
But surely you have an opinion
The others have no opinion?
In settlement of this dispute...
...I, Jean de Coras, Counselor
of the Toulouse Parliament...
...declare that there is
no reason...
...to believe this man
is not Martin Guerre
The charge is dismissed
due to lack of proof
This man shall be released
Pierre Guerre is condemned
to pay...
...500 livres to the King
and to his nephew, for calumny
Free him
You are a knave! God knows it
and will punish you!
You hold water in one hand,
fire in the other
That was an excellent judgment
What happened to my brother?
You should be in bed
On your feet!
This time we've got you
Get dressed
Get up, you're under arrest!
I was released yesterday!
Things changed during the night
This time your wife signed, too
Get dressed, you're going
to Toulouse
When did she sign?
Last night, before going to bed
Is it true?
They made you sign?
This time you're done for
The accusation is the same
But it will be more difficult
to answer
Your wife signed
It's a forgery
If so, why did she let them
arrest you?
Her uncle and cousins scare her
They might cut her throat
They've threatened her?
Often
Especially lately
She now says you betrayed her
That you're not her husband...
That's serious
I know her...
They forced her to sign.
Assure her safety
and ask me what you want
You'll see I'm Martin Guerre
We've heard many witnesses...
...and we shall hear more
Shall a counselor defend you?
I don't need help to prove
who I am
Who married you?
Father Dominique Caylar...
he's still there
He doesn't like me...
I swear a lot
We married on St. Michael's day,
18 years ago
Who was the notary?
Jehan Pegala, from Fosset
He was late, my father was upset
Bertrande's dowry was the
Roussas woods...
...her lands at Pomarede
and two oxen...
...a bed with feather pillows...
...and three dresses
And sacks of grain,
have you forgotten?
No... no sacks of grain
Since returning,
you've been a loving husband
That wasn't so before
Had I known my wife better,
I wouldn't have left
And she's changed
So have I
You're not stupid
You know you risk death?
It's all Pierre Guerre's doing!
I was his nephew until
I wanted my money
Everyone knew me: My sisters,
my wife's mother...
...even my wife
Others also say you're not Martin
My uncle's rich
They're afraid of him!
He acts out of self-interest!
He'd rob me of my name
and my property!
It's outrageous!
Follow me
You are Jean the Spaniard
and Valentin Rougier?
You asked to see this man
Do you know him?
Yes... it's him
Who is he?
What's his name?
It's Arnaud
They call him Pansette
Where's he from?
Our village
He's from Tihl
You're sure?
He left a long time ago
but that's him
Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat?
No... Arnaud, from Tihl
Called Pansette
Look at them!
They're sent by my uncle!
Bought and paid for!
Look at them...
shame written on their faces!
They're from Tihl,
that's been verified
So what? My uncle has influence
Why should I pretend?
To have a house and a wife
But it's my house and my wife!
I知 wronged... and I'm accused!
Never was a husband so maligned!
But I'll appeal...
to the Parliament here!
I want my uncle to be punished
So it'll all be clear!
I want them all here
First Pierre, guilty
of bearing false witness
Also my sisters and cousins
And my wife who was forced
to sign, and all the villagers
Artigat has been my parish
for 23 years
I knew Martin Guerre well,
I married him
When he left, he was thinner,
darker and a bit stooped
He had a cleft chin
and slightly drooping lips
And a hairy mole on his neck
Show us
Here, in the neck
There's no trace of it
And a scar above
his right eyebrow...
...also not there
No, sir... that's wrong!
I knew Martin
when he was little, too
I diapered him... and saw
him naked, more often than you!
He had no hairy mole
He had a scar on his forehead...
and still has!
It was closer to his eyebrow
It was here... I ought to know
He fell in the barn,
I picked him up
Also... open your mouth...
...he broke two teeth
There they are, in back
And a pushed-in thumbnail!
So you maintain that he is
Martin Guerre?
I知 sure, sir...
as sure as night follows day
May I speak?
I致e seen death
I've heard the roar of cannon
and the screams of the wounded
You wish me ill, Uncle,
but I've lived through worse
But must that be a man's fate...
...for wanting to live
a little...
...before returning
to his family...
...to work the land God gave us?
Don't let him talk any more!
He's clever with words
We know who he is now
All he wanted was
my nephew's property
I don't want to take it,
I'm defending it!
He's not my nephew!
Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it
Cobbler... step forward
Is it sure they'll let me go?
If I say what I have to say,
can I leave?
I guarantee you'll return
to your village
Before he left, Martin had
a very large foot
His size was 12 points
After he came back...
...his size was only 9 points!
You're quite sure?
Yes, and in my trade
I've seen feet grow bigger...
...but I've never known
feet to shrink
You're getting old!
Your sight's going...
You forget things
I see better than you,
you old mule!
You see where your interest lies!
Jacmette, your fingers remember
Tell them who I am...
Tell the truth
You're Martin Guerre
Bertrande, my wife, you know me
better than anyone
Swear I'm not your husband
and I will yield
Swear it on the Holy Gospel
You won't swear it?
Therefore I am your husband?
You are my husband
Come forward, Bertrande
And this cross?
I didn't draw it
Then why didn't you protest?
They threatened me
To throw me out.
- She's lying...
that cross is her mark!
- It's the truth!
They'll do anything...
They tried to kill me!
It's her mark...
I saw her sign it!
I didn't sign!
I would've signed my name!
How? You can't write!
I壇 like a quill and some paper
All this fuss over money!
Pierre knows it's his nephew
Mass at six in the morning,
for everyone
Pierre, how long
are we staying here?
I don't know...
As long as it takes
Who pays for it?
I値l pay you
Enough to live on...
that's the law
Who is Bertrande de Rols?
Why do you want her?
She's to be lodged separately
It's me, Bertrande de Rols
Follow me with your children,
by order of the Parliament
Blessed Virgin Mary,
see my distress and my sorrow
Please, help me
Protect me. I feel so lonely...
I brought some chestnut bread
It's from our village
It's cold here
My only child...
Do you want to ruin us?
But for you, that impostor
would have been executed by now
He seems to have bewitched you
You're under a spell...
You only see him
All he's after is our property
Your husband has bewitched
you.
My own mother attacks us
If he isn't my husband,
why did you wait three years?
I wasn't clear before
Now we know he's not Martin
I was always suspicious of him
He uses you and you say "Amen!"
He's my husband... I know he is
Didn't Pierre offer money
to Dominge at your inn?
Accused, sit down and
stay seated!
Continue
Didn't he?
Money to pay for killing me!
Call Dominge Pailhas
Don't be afraid
Did Pierre offer you money?
Be honest... yes or no?
Yes, he offered me money
I said I wouldn't kill
a relative...
...even for money
I'm sort of related to Martin
It's true, that's what he said
Thank you. You may go now
Come, Jeanne.
Speak up now.
Didn't Uncle urge my wife
to accuse me?
It's true
Didn't he threaten
to throw her out?
It's true.
Didn't he raise his hand to her?
It's a lie!
Let me talk to her husband
Accused, remain seated!
Come, Augustin
You lived under our roof
After the soldier had
been there...
...you said: Be careful
My uncle was sending people
after me to beat me up
Remember?
To teach me a lesson
You must remember.
We'd beaten the Vals team...
...4- 2. A Sunday in August!
I remember
It's true
So, Uncle, you thought
I'd never find out?
He's the impostor...
the criminal!
He should be sitting here
If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner...
...who profaned God...
...what do I care?
I知 not Arnaud of Tihl!
I知 not this man!
I知 not!
The man's memory is prodigious...
...and he's very clever
What if he were a demon?
It has happened before
Demons like to enter
human beings...
...and poison their minds
What do you say?
Lies have a thousand faces...
...even the Demon's
Truth has only one
And justice exists...
...to discover the truth
Jacmette Cayrol has gone to God
Beat the devil out of him!
Stop fighting
Stop it! Jacmette is dead!
Jacmette is dead
He knew everything better than
anyone in the village
When he came back...
...he knew my sons' names
He'd look at me...
I couldn't move
I felt that I was...
...on fire!
I知 sure he uses magic
Even here, with all of us!
Since the world began...
...Satan has had a store of magic
How can he know so much?
And have all the answers?
He is the Devil's emissary
Perhaps he is a devil himself!
I知 not a devil...
Be seated
If a devil is in you, speak
Tell us his name
A devil?
Then I'd be with my wife!
I wouldn't have been arrested!
I wouldn't be here!
He answered well
There's no proof of any magic
What should we do?
Any suggestions?
The most humane solution...
Presume innocence if guilt
is not proven
But first...
...I'd like another chance
to question...
...Martin Guerre's wife
The Court turns to you
Now...
...and for the last time...
...I ask you...
...if that man is your husband
Yes... I'm sure
How can you be
absolutely certain?
Speak... We are here to learn all
On his return,
he knew all about me
Did he know intimate details...
...only a husband could know?
What details?
He knew when I wanted him...
...and the words to say
Before...
...during...
...and after
The Court...
...will now retire to deliberate
I think that does it
This peasant seems to have
won his case
He's Martin Guerre
It would be inhuman
not to free him
We'll clear his name
Could anyone else
have defended him better?
In the name of the King
and of his justice...
...this Parliament...
...hereby declares...
...that the accused is indeed...
...is indeed Martin...
A new witness insists
on being heard
Have him come forward
You claim to be Martin Guerre?
Yes... that's my name
Where were you?
In Picardy... the Army
I lost my leg at St. Quentin
When I arrived in Artigat,
I heard my family was here.
Here I am
Do you know that man?
We soldiered together
His name?
He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette
Don't listen! Look at them...
Having lost, they try a ruse!
A beggar, hired by my uncle!
Do you know that woman?
Bertrande, my wife
It's one last low trick!
You wrong me...
and you insult me?
Wrong you?
I致e never laid eyes on you!
Why don't you arrest him?
A hired liar!
Pierre Guerre, come forward.
Where is your wife?
Do you know this man?
Yes, I recognize him
Martin, my nephew
Let me hug you.
At last you're back
You're quite sure?
Yes, I'm sure
He's my brother's son
He's my son-in-law,
returned to us by God
Arrest him!
- Sit down!
Proof he was paid!
He arrives now...
...just in time, like a miracle!
It's God's doing
The hand of God,
manifesting itself
It's divine justice
God has sent him...
...to prevent injustice!
Don't forsake me!
It's a plot against me
In my own family!
Please listen to me once more...
I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat
He's a paid liar
He was taught what to say,
but I will confound him
Let me put him to the test!
You claim to be me! Tell me...
...on my wedding night...
...who gave us the nuptial bowl?
She did. Catherine Bore...
She tucked us in
Just after the wedding
I was bewitched
How many masses were said for me?
It's so long ago... and I'm tired
Answer!
Six...
- He's wrong! He doesn't know!
Not six... four!
Dominique Caylar, answer.
Tell the truth
I said four masses, it's true
You should have been
better informed
Where was the spell broken?
At the priest's
Was it hot or cold?
Cold... I was naked
We warmed up quickly!
Who bought the sacks of grain
I stole?
Smallpox Andre
You learned that lesson well
When I went away,
what did I leave...
...in the linen-chest upstairs?
What did I leave?
I left it! What was it?
White breeches!
Sewn by Bertrande...
and you didn't know!
But I told you.
- No, I told you!
Don't twist it around!
Arrest him!
I致e proven I'm Martin Guerre
You say you told him?
And he's trying to use it!
But before you said...
...you didn't know him
Accused, sit down
The sisters, come here
Which one is your brother?
Make up your minds
This is my brother
No, you're making a mistake!
And you, Guillemette?
What do you say?
I can't remember
I was too little
Maybe it's him
He's my father!
You treated me like a brother...
I am your brother!
Silence!
What do you say?
Of no importance...
I'm not family
Catherine... tell them
Forgive me, Martin
Don't cry... Women cry easily
You should have known
your own husband
Our house is dishonored
It's all your fault
You're to blame, Martin
You betrayed my friendship
You deserve no pity
What harm in caring for
a woman her husband deserted?
We await your confession,
Arnaud of Tihl
It's true
We soldiered together
He talked about his wife...
...his son, his house
One day on the road,
two men took me for him
They called me Martin
It gave me an idea
I thought...
...why not take his place?
So I learned all I could
Martin said he wasn't going back
I went to Artigat
I was taken for him
I almost told them...
"I fooled you!
Martin's up north!"
I almost said it
Then I saw you
I took you in my arms
Next day, it was too late
After that, I learned
whatever I didn't know...
...from my uncle, sisters, wife
And I remember it
There's no magic in it...
...I swear it
You don't deserve her
I know her better than you do
I ask you all to forgive me
And you...
...who were my wife
Your men can stay in the barn
Are you thirsty?
Where's Bertrande?
At home
Pierre Guerre, you brought
discord to this village
Now keep the peace
Leave us, please
I'm thirsty
You have dared much
and feared God very little
We hesitated before
declaring you innocent
It was unwise to take
that stranger into your bed
Women are often the victims...
...of men's wickedness
That's why we acquitted you...
...and legitimized...
...your daughter's birth
We hope that now...
...you will be a good wife
But tell me...
...so I'll understand
Before Arnaud appeared...
...you needed a man?
And this one pleased you?
Did he satisfy your needs?
You loved each other?
You knew from the start?
You can tell me
It will go no farther
Arnaud and I...
...were good together
Martin had neglected me
Arnaud respected me...
...like a true husband
I trusted him
We thought of asking to be judged
We could have won
If Martin hadn't turned up,
we'd be man and wife
No one could've denied it
At the last minute...
...why did you change?
Why choose Martin?
In Arnaud's eyes...
...I saw it was hopeless
I saw what he wanted
He wanted me to live...
for me and my children
So I did it
God forgive me,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law,
all those I offended...
...forgive me!
Get up, Arnaud
Open the door
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law...
...all those I offended!
Forgive me God,
I defiled marriage!
The King, the law...
...all those I offended!
Commend your soul to God
The story of false
Martin Guerre...
...ended that morning
The Counselor, Jean de Coras
impressed by this...
...daring imposture,
made a record of it
12 years later came...
...the St. Bartholomew Massacre
For his Protestant beliefs...
...Jean de Coras was hung before
the Toulouse Parliament...
...with a hundred of his friends
But we live only by the spirit
