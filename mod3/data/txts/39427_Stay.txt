Do you remember
when we first met?
What does that have to do
with anything?
Well, do ya?
The timeless waves,
bright, sifting, broken glass,
came glinting,
sifting from the americas.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Not that part.
After.
At the pub.
I don't know.
We went for a pint,
and you were going on
and on and on
about overrated heaney was
until Angie told you to shut it.
Well, yeah.
But it wasn't her
who set me straight.
No?
It was you
when you dropped your hand
on my knee.
That I did.
That I did.
I used to do some prep work
at the queen of tarts.
The wages here aren't what
they are in galway, you know.
Oh, no, no.
This wasn't in galway.
This was back home.
There's a queen of
tarts in Toronto?
Um, actually,
I'm from Montreal,
but it's the same thing.
How's the Professor?
He's fine.
Listen, Abbey,
don't you think you're a bit
over your head here?
Excuse me?
Surely, there must be some kids
your own age to play with, no?
How'd it go?
She wants to hire
somebody local.
Oh, you're local. Yes?
Whatever, Dermot.
What's wrong?
Did you forget your sense
of humor in town?
Hmm?
What is this?
Vitamin c, Dermot.
It's called vitamin c.
Uh, "vit-imin" c.
It's called "vit-imin" c, Abbey,
in this country.
You know, just as well
that it didn't work out.
'Cause that woman
gives me the creeps.
Want a drink?
Now, listen, there's no need
for you to be working
at bridge house.
I've enough money
for the two of us.
Oh, I know.
I know.
I know.
I just feel like
I should contribute... More.
I can think of ways for
you to contribute... More.
<i>Au naturel.</i>
Oh.
Stop it,
you filthy, filthy old man.
Let me finish in here alone.
And will you take
those damn boots off?
I just swept.
Dermot?
Aye.
Do you ever think maybe
it's time to grow up?
Well, I'm glad to see you've
relocated your sense of humor.
No. I'm serious.
What on earth for?
I've got all need
right here, right now...
beer, crisps, you.
Perfect.
Perfect.
Oh, perfect.
Shit.
How was school?
Grand. How was work?
Grand.
Neither do you, so...
School.
Thanks, Liam, as always,
for being such a help
around the place.
Did you know that chili
is not Mexican at all.
They just make it
for the bloody tourists.
I bought some salad?
How 'bout some salad?
All right.
Although, there's a story
about beautiful sister
Mary Agreda of Spain
who'd go into these trances...
- Oh.
- Darling.
Don't worry.
Why bother with the rest
of this stinkin' world?
Why bother?
Why bother?
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe I'm a little bit
too young
to be holed up in this dump
at the end of the world?
Has it?
No.
No, I didn't think that it had.
Hello?
Are you almost done pouting?
Almost.
I'm sorry.
It's not a dump.
It's cute.
I'm glad we agree on something.
But I am thinking about
going home for a bit.
Home?
I thought your home
was here with me?
It'd be good for us.
Get some perspective on things.
Suit yourself, then.
Hey, Sean!
Come on. Come on.
Hey!
There you go.
Hey, Eileen.
Hiya.
There you go.
Ach, they just never let up,
do they?
We haven't even paid
the last bill yet.
Ah, but where would we be
without electricity, huh?
In the dark, Mrs. McGilloway.
In the dark.
Oh, those lemon squares
Positively...
Edible.
I told ya.
The prick!
Abandoning this place
like it's a pair of old shoes.
Look!
Look at the state of this place.
I know, but it's not Liam's fault
that his banker went bankrupt.
I told... I told him nothing
good would come
at destroying the countryside.
I told him that ages ago.
But, of course, nobody listens
to what I've got to say.
No. Why would they?
I thought you loved it here.
I thought you loved me.
Stop being such a drama queen.
I'm only going back for a visit,
not to stay.
But why?
Why now?
Because it's been ages.
And it's time.
It's time.
All right?
All right.
All right, all right.
Oh, it'll be so nice to see dad.
And Lisa.
I miss them so much.
Not as much as I'll miss you.
Isn't absence supposed to make
the heart grow fonder?
No need for that.
If you...
you feel the need to deceive me,
at least put a decent effort
into hiding the evidence.
I was gonna tell you.
I mean, obviously,
I was gonna tell you.
I just didn't...
I didn't know what...
I didn't know what to say.
How about,
"hey, Dermot, I'm pregnant. "
Well, y-y-yeah, but...
But what?
But... you... oh,
you want to keep it?
No! No, actually.
I... I don't.
I'm... well...
- Well, what?
- Well...
I told you right from the start
how I felt about the baby thing.
It's just not for me.
I was very honest about that.
Unlike some people it seems.
We need to figure this out,
Abbey.
Okay.
Will you marry me?
What about the baby?
You see, that's exactly
the problem
with having a baby.
All of a sudden,
it's all about the bloody baby.
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about us...
you and me.
What are you...
what are you doing?
Come... come on.
Will you get I...
Okay. Okay.
I shouldn't have said that thing
about the baby.
But look what happened
with Sophie.
If she'd only...
What?
If she'd only what?
If she'd only listened to you,
she would still be alive?
Is that really what you think?
A - Abbey, listen.
Listen. Listen.
I'm sorry.
I... I...
who is... who is this?
No, I don't need
a fuckin' mobile!
Thank you.
Bye now.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Now what can I do you for?
Uh, 20 carrolls and box
of matches, please.
Did you hear about
Mrs. McGilloway?
No. What?
She passed away.
Eileen McGilloway?
The post woman.
And she had just gone 53.
No way. Of what?
Must've been the heart.
Keeting found her.
Parked in the driveway.
Still in the van.
Slumped over in her seat.
Really?
"Will you marry me?"
I mean, for fuck's sake.
What planet is he livin' on?
I should've never introduced
the two of ye.
Dermot is not right for ya.
I mean, he's all over the place.
Always has been, always will be.
Now, how about Martin?
He's cute.
If you think he's so cute,
why don't you do him?
Who says I haven't?
Ooh.
Ah, come on.
Smarten up.
You only live once.
Look what they cat dragged in.
The Professor.
Fay will do.
Thank you very much.
Can I have a pint of guinness,
there, please?
Hey, did you hear?
Eileen McGilloway's died.
I know. I know.
That's so sad.
I saw her only this morning.
She seemed fine.
Yeah.
Pressure.
That's how these things happen.
Oy. Enjoying your time off?
Fairly nice.
The whole country goes bust,
and all you can do is close.
Hey, Liam, did you know
about Eileen McGilloway?
Yeah.
Know her?
He did her daughter.
Do you need a hand?
No. No, no, no.
I'm fine.
I'm just, uh...
Are you sure?
Yeah, no, I'm just, uh,
checkin' out this gate is all.
For what?
Uh...
I'm, uh, thinkin' of
building a fence,
and, uh...
Well, you know, uh,
I could, uh, build it for you.
What?
The fence.
Out corrupting the youth,
Professor?
If you must know,
I'm looking into
employment opportunities
for this young lad.
Glad to hear it.
Not enough of that
about these days.
So long.
- So long.
- You know,
I... I... I can do this
for, uh, 10 Euros an hour.
For... are you kidding me?
For building a fence?
Forget it.
You know, by the way,
there's, uh, no need to
make an arse of yourself
when you can just climb the wall
around there.
I'm not a cripple, you know.
Just enjoy it.
It's not gonna last forever.
I'm not even sure I'm keeping it.
I mean, Dermot
certainly doesn't want...
Oh, fuck him.
He needs to get over
himself in a hurry.
Well, I'm not entirely sure
that my own gene pool
needs propagating either.
Taking off to Costa Rica for love
does not a genetic flaw make.
I was six.
And your mother an idiot.
Anyways, what happened
between your parents
has nothing to do with
you and your child.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do not call it my child.
It's way, way, way too early
for that.
So you're not going home
just to reconnect with daddy,
then, are ya?
No.
Yes.
M - maybe.
Listen, Abbey,
before you make a decision,
just make sure it's for
the right reasons.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hiya, Sean.
Uh, need a hand with that?
No, you're grand.
What the fuck, Dermot?
Where are you?
Why aren't you picking up
the phone?
I'm, uh...
well, I'm off,
so I'll see you around, I guess.
Bye.
<i>This is a preboarding
announcement</i>
<i>for flight ts-619.</i>
You been up to see here yet?
No, not yet.
You should.
You really should.
How long now?
Two weeks.
Oh, the last ones are the worst.
With Stella, my youngest...
Quite how big I got.
Y - you must be Deirdre.
Yes, I am.
I'm sorry about your mother.
She'll be missed.
You're the Professor, right?
Ah. Was. Sort of. Yeah.
I used to teach archeology
at trinity.
Right. Yeah, I remember.
It's Dermot?
Dermot Fay.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Your mother told me
all about you, too.
Well, sort of.
I didn't know that, you know,
you, uh...
I'm sure she was...
she was thrilled.
Excuse me for a moment.
You need a hand?
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.
You think Eileen knew?
Of course not.
She would have told us for sure.
Hey.
Uh, Liam's on his way over.
That's nice.
Sorry about your mom.
I'm so sorry.
She looks grand, Deirdre.
She really does.
Deirdre, sorry about your mom.
Sorry about your troubles.
What good does that do ya?
- What age are you?
- 13.
13 years old.
Get that into you.
Go on. Be a man.
That's it.
God. Deirdre.
Okay. Okay.
Deep breaths.
Okay?
Go on and get an ambulance,
will ya?
Okay. Come on.
That's good.
You sure that's a good idea?
I'm teaching the
young lad a lesson.
Nope! Wait!
Finish it.
Go on.
You're a man now.
Go on.
All right.
That's enough.
Off with ya.
So, uh, y-you know
about that fence...
- What fence?
- You know, the one
we were, uh, talking about
building around your place?
Remember?
Oh, yeah.
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'll do it for,
uh, six Euros an hour.
Six Euros?
Yeah. That's final offer.
- Right, so.
- Yeah?
I... I'll see you then.
See ya.
- Hiya.
- Hiya.
So what's the story
with the shite
you're looking to take
at my doorstep?
Why don't you ask the
fucker from Dublin
who shipped out to Australia
and left me stuck
with the bills?
Ohh, right. I forgot.
Hell is other people.
Could use a beer.
We've got some
catching up to do.
In the name of Jesus.
Come, lady, give us a
hand here, will ya?
Okay, we need to turn her over.
Lie down.
Hold these.
Excuse me.
Can you believe this?
Thank God she didn't
have to see this.
Stop your gawking.
Thanks.
Get out!
Out, out, out.
All of you, go on.
Come on.
Stay.
Please.
You're all right.
Is there anyone you
want me to contact?
No.
You'll be all right.
Shh. It's okay.
Hey, help is on the way.
Okay?
Hang in there.
Hang in there.
Help is on the way.
You have to follow in
your own car, man.
Oh, no, sh-she's not my wife.
Oh, feck off.
That's it. That's it.
That's it.
Get mad. Get mad.
Come on. Push!
Take a breath now.
Take a breath.
Take a breath.
There we go!
Keep going!
Push!
Push! Push! Push!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
This is it!
You're there.
It's a boy.
I've got a baby.
For a minute there,
I thought I was dying.
All right. Relax.

Oh.
Abbey.
What are you doing here?
I thought you said you weren't
gonna be here till Wednesday.
Dad, today is Wednesday.
Oh, shit.
Guess I messed up, huh?
Hey, what happened to your arm?
Oh, that's nothing.
Let me help you.
Actually, no, it is a big deal.
Five weeks paid holiday.
How are you Professor Fay?
Dermot.
Call me Dermot.
Uh, that's... that's Mary.
I'm to look after her.
Are these your wife's?
No. They're not.
All right.
You're gonna start
at the far corner.
And, uh, just follow my line
at that old stone wall.
You'll need a post
every eight feet or so.
- All right?
- All right? - Yeah.
Where's your, uh, equipment?
Oh, uh...
I, uh, don't have any.
Hope you have strong hands.
Mary, stop it.
I've got work to do.
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, well,
you should have thought of that
when you had the chance.
But I hate eggs.
You know that.
All right.
Hold on. Hold on.
What have I got?
Here.
All right. All right.
You win. You win.
Stop. You win.
Here you go.
Thanks.
How'd it go?
Yeah, most fun I ever had.
Let me know if you
need anything.
Thanks.
You know for everything.
You're welcome.
So you finally made it home.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't
make it back earlier,
but, you know, shit happens.
Okay.
Who is that?
Oh, that's Celine.
She's dropping off supplies.
Ohh.
Hey, there.
Hey!
So what are you doing here?
I thought you were busy
in Ireland studying.
Why anyone would go all
the way to potato country
to study art history
is beyond me.
Hello.
Hey.
Well, I was. I am.
I just thought it was time
to check in on dad.
She's such a good girl, huh?
Abbey, really, we're fine.
He's fine.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Well, I'm glad I came home,
because he needs me.
Clearly.
So how long are you
planning on staying?
I don't know.
It depends.
I... I'm not sure.
<i>Ça va?</i>
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I'm good.
I'm... I'm great, actually.
I just needed a break.
That's all.
Well, if you ever need a break
from taking a break, Abbey,
you know where to find me.
Ho!
If you take out all the stones,
it'll take a year.
You said every eight feet.
This is... this is a fence
Not a science project.
I meant every eight feet or so.
Oh.
Now.
You will have to go down
at least two feet, though,
if it's to last the winter.
Yeah.
Aye?
Yeah.
Jesus God.
What are you doin'?
This is private property.
I found a strap.
So?
And I reported it to the IAWU.
What for?
The last time I checked,
you're to report
anything you find in the bog
to the IAWU.
Sure, if it's something
of historical value.
And that would certainly
apply here.
They've asked me
to secure the sight
until they find someone
from the national museum
to send over, so I suggest
you stay away.
Ah, you're a horse shite.
And a... and a bullocks.
What the fuck is that anyway?
Oh, isn't that shocking, now?
Kids today. Tsk, tsk.
So how is the old geezer?
He's almost your age.
Exactly.
He asked me to marry him.
Really?
Really.
Well, don't do it.
He's just looking
for a nurse maid.
Dad!
Do the math, Abbey.
Do the math.
Yeah, well, you're one to talk.
What? Celine?
She's 51.
That's hardly half my age.
Besides, I've always
been straight with her
about what I can
and cannot give her.
You know, actually, so is he.
So you're not here asking
parental permission
to ruin the rest of your life?
No.
All right.
So why don't we toast
the happy couple?
Mnh-mnh.
Water's fine.
What, you having
second thoughts?
Mnh-mnh.
That's good. I like that.
No. It's...
the smell of alcohol makes me
want to puke these days.
You know, you don't
have to marry him
out of some misguided sense
of obligation.
Nothing good will come of that.
Excuse me?
You're not stuck with him yet.
You could get a place right
here in the neighborhoods.
Celine could help.
I'd be there for you.
What are you talking about?
A boy, a girl.
Myself, I'd love to have a boy...
Oh, yeah. Not now.
I got to go for a walk, dad.
I really do.
You know what?
Fuck you, then.
Hi.
Uh... Do you live here?
L... Lisa doesn't live here
anymore?
Oh, okay.
Sor... I'm sorry.
<i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>Salut.</i>
Who?
Alex du toit.
She works here.
Never heard of her.
So what would you like to drink?
Thanks.
It's too late to cash in,
you know.
What's that?
No, no, don't play dumb
with me, Fay.
Why would a blow-in like you
with no livestock to look after
need a fence?
You're trying to sell.
I just want a fence.
I don't see the crime in that.
Taking a break from
being an arsehole?
How can you be so callous
about your own history, Liam?
Ah, you really think
I can afford to give a shit?
I'm this far away from
losing my business.
And now you fuck up
any potential sale
because of a strap.
Nice.
Fill us a pint, will ya?
What a novel idea.
Drowning your sorrows
in a pint of drink.
Actually, I'm thinking
of getting pigs...
a whole slew of them.
Idle by the swine.
How does that sound to you, huh?
Okay, so I checked with my boss,
and Alex move out west
to broaden her horizons.
Ohh, yes.
She always was
a little bit of a hippie.
Hey, what are you up to later?
I'm going home.
Well, I could give you a ride.
My shift is almost over.
Where do you live?
I... it's funny
that you should ask.
And the answer is...?
Ireland.
I live in Ireland.
What is this?
What?
- This.
- Oh, right.
Uh, yes.
Granted I went a little too far,
but it was on sale.
Look at this.
Isn't this adorable, huh?
What if it's a girl?
Uh, then I'll exchange it.
No sweat.
And... This.
You had one of these, huh?
Uh, this is nontoxic,
no child labor,
it's... and it's educational.
What if I don't keep it?
Oh, don't say that.
That's silly like your mother.
And look what I found
in the back closet.
Remember?
- I am her daughter.
- Yes, but she was weak.
And you're not like that.
You'd never leave your child
for some fun in the sun.
Do you want some tea?
You hate tea.
Yeah, well, things change.
Hiya.
Bills, bills, bills.
I can't remember the last time
the post brought me
anything but crap.
See ya.

When are we getting
the wire, Professor Fay?
It's Dermot.
How often do I have to say it?
It's going well.
Yeah, whatever.
Don't "whatever" me.
That's such a boring attitude
to take.
I brought sandwiches.
Just like my mother's.
Is it?
Yeah.
So what'd you teach in Dublin?
You should ask me
what I learned.
Mm. I agree.
About school,
I don't see the point in going
because, like, most of the stuff
they teach you
is gonna be outdated
by the time I leave.
And if it's really
that important,
I can always just...
just Google it.
Google it?
Listen, I don't know what it is
that keeps you
from going to school,
but whatever it is, trust me,
it's not worth ruining
the rest of your life for.
I was, uh...
I was, uh, caught
downloading stuff
off the Internet at school.
Like what?
Porn?
Maybe.
Well, that's definitely stupid,
but it's not the end
of the world.
Most of your teachers
are probably doing it, too.
Mind you, at home.
Hi, there.
I'm from the national museum,
and, uh,
I've come about a strap
you've reported.
Michael?
Yeah.
It's Dermot.
Dermot Fay.
Gosh, you've... Changed.
It's been what?
Oh.
It's been awhile.
What are you doing out here?
I didn't know you'd switched
to working in the field.
Well, I didn't.
I live here.
- Where?
- Right there.
That's where you live?
Aye.
I heard you'd gone out west
after the whole, uh, debacle,
but when I got back from Asia,
no one knew how to
get in touch with you.
Uh, well, that was the point.
Weird the places we
wind up in, isn't it?
A kid growing up in a
cramped reading flat,
I dreamed of far-flung places,
of Egypt and Indonesia, siam.
Discovering El dorado
or the elephant's
graveyard, Camelot.
So to wind up trying to dig up
Irish history...
"Trying" being the operative word.
...As an englishmen is ironic.
Like you didn't have
bigger plans for yourself.
Living like a hermit
at the end of the world.
I'm not a hermit.
I work...
Editing other people's
crappy stuff.
I travel...
To galway sometimes.
That's where I met Abbey...
at a poetry reading.
If you don't mind.
Who is that?
Oh, that's just a kid
building a fence for me.
Sorry.
Just a kid building
a fence for you.
Yes. Just a kid building
a fence for me,
or meant to be.
Probably the same age as
Sophie's kid, hasn't he?
What was his name?
Rory, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Listen, you know what?
I have to pick something up
in town.
I'm sure you'll be fine here
on your own.
I'll, uh... I'll catch up
with you later, all right?
All right.
Morning, sweetheart.
Huh?
Oh, dad.
I'm sorry about last night.
Oh, it's okay.
You know, as long as you make me
breakfast in bed
every single day,
all is forgiven.
Wow.
You know, this baby could be
the best thing that ever
happened to you.
God. Well, that's
not saying much.
What are you talking about?
You look pretty well adjusted.
Dad...
I just don't want
to do this alone.
You're not alone.
You got Celine.
You got me.
And all this baby's
going to need is love...
tons of love...
and a parent with
nerves of steel.
Where is everybody?
Don't know.
Out lookin' for work.
That's nice.
After mom left,
it was just me and dad,
you know?
It was just us.
It was just us against
the rest of this stinkin' world.
Well, that was then,
and this is now.
Now you have to look out
for your own.
He told you?
It's great news, Abbey.
Oh, no, no.
It's a little more complicated
than that.
Does he love you?
Yes, actually.
He does love me.
The idea of a baby...
not so much.
Oh, he'll come around.
Once he sees how cute
his mini me is,
he won't be able to resist.
If there's even gonna be
a mini me.
Okay, let me get this straight.
- He loves you?
- Yes.
- And you love him?
- Yes.
So what is the problem?
You know what happened
with mom.
So?
So who's to say
I wouldn't choose a lover
over my child?
Abbey, surely you understand
that it was a bit more
complicated than that.
No, look at me.
I'm my mother's spitting image.
I'm hopping around
from place to place.
I cannot form
a lasting relationship
with anything other
than my backpack.
The only difference is,
is that went east
instead of South.
So it was fun in the rain for me.
Wait.
Where's the wire?
Shit.
Wasn't in yet.
Tomorrow.
I'll get it tomorrow.
What? What?
You think I can't even get you
a bunch of wire?
I didn't say anything.
Good.
Last thing I need right now
is attitude.
Gob shouting at you.
Now, this might prove
to be a bit difficult,
but it's time.
You need to lead your own life
and make your own mistakes.
What is that?
Your mother's diary.
I found it when Frank asked
me to throw out her stuff.
Dad?
Dad, are you here?
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm fine. Thanks.
Okay, then.
Fine. Knock yourself out.
Do you know what
I hate most about it?
Is that it's so bloody stupid,
you know?
I mean, who gets knocked up
in a one-night stand
and keeps the baby?
How 19-bloody-50s is that?
You're better off without
a bloke, anyways.
You know, mostly all
my dad did was,
he'd make me mom
have more babies,
and then he'd just
take off anyway.
The Professor... what'd
he do that was so bad?
Don't really know.
Whatever it is,
it must have been something
really, really stupid.
Probably something to do
with a girl.
That's always it, isn't it?
Anyways, he lost
his job at trinity
and has been forced to
live here ever since.
I thought he liked it here?
Well, that's part of it maybe,
but...
I mean, there's more to it,
I'm sure.
Hey.
Do you want another one?
Absolutely.
Hey.
You scared me.
Yes, it looks like it.
May I come in?
Do I have a choice?
No, not really.
I'm not, uh, really prepared
for visitors.
I'll have a cup of tea
if that's all right.
That would be grand.
Tea it is.
"Everything that begins to be,
begins by way of motion
or change. "
Yeah. Easy to say
when you're young
and the future lies ahead of ya
all fresh and sparkly.
Now I just want to hold on
to what it is I have.
Or might have.
She's pregnant.
So why didn't you go with her?
She went to Canada
to see her dad,
not to England to have
an abortion, you idiot.
So she's keeping it?
I don't know.
And apparently I don't have
a say in the matter.
Well, maybe that's for the best...
Given your, uh...
Why do you keep bringing
that ancient stuff up?
It has nothing to do
with anything.
If that were true,
then why exactly are
we breaking our backs
in that bog of yours?
Sweetheart, I'm home.
I got chicken and fish.
Which one do you want?
I know women in your condition
to be quite specific.
Where did you get that?
"As I am sentenced
to watch her stupid games...
"I wonder how far I could get
before she would notice
I was gone. "
Celine was supposed to
throw that away.
Nobody throws out diaries, dad.
Nobody does that.
"Days vanish into nothing.
The self dissolves. "
Give me that.
You lied to me.
She didn't run off to Costa Rica
for some fun in the sun.
There was no lover.
She hated being a mother.
She hated being my mother.
She was confused.
She was troubled.
- Abbey, it wasn't your fault.
- Oh, and then this one.
No. Listen.
She was weak.
And at the first
sign of trouble,
she just... she just ran away.
Yeah.
Just like me.
Listen, Dermot.
- The only way you can
honor Sophie now... - Shut it.
- Shut it.
- It's shutting.
# You'll be in town
by tomorrow #
# I think it's time
that I stop by #
# I haven't seen you in awhile #
# I just needed time #
# I wonder if you've changed
a whole lot #
# because I sure feel
like I have #
So what is it going to be today?
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.
- # It's been a year #
- All right.
And make it a double.
# It's been so long #
# all I want to do is say hello #
# it's been a year #
# it's been so long #
# all I want to do is say hello.
Do you? #
# and I hope you're
just as glad to see me, too #
# yeah, I hope you're
just as glad to see me, too #
# It's been a year #
# it's been so long #
# all I want to do
is say hello. Do you? #
# and I hope you're just as
glad to see me, too #
# yeah, I hope you're
just as glad to see me, too #
# yeah, I hope you're
just as glad to see me, too #
# oh, I hope you're
just as glad to see me, too #
What happened to you?
Went out with Deirdre last night.
- Deirdre?
- Mm.
She, uh... she says she
still has your coat
if, uh, you want it back.
If I want it?
It's my coat, isn't it?
Come in out of the rain.
Come on.
Cup of tea?
Uh, juice.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, what's that?
<i>Kilian en vitae.</i>
It's about Saint Kilian,
who met a particularly
bitter end...
the wrath of a German
woman to be precise.
I'm writing a book about him.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, sort of.
Trying.
There's a stack of material
about him upstairs
if you're interested.
No, I'm... I'm grand.
Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.
So what was the stupid
thing you did?
Excuse me?
You must have done
something really stupid.
Why else would you live at
the arse end of nowhere?
I told you my secret,
so it's... it's only fair.
Fair has nothing to do
with anything.
Fine.
I had an affair with
a student of mine.
When she became pregnant,
I thought it best she get rid of it.
Instead, she had the baby
and then she killed herself.
But, uh, I'll go help unload.
Oh, that reminds me.
Your pay so far.
Thanks.
Wait. Aren't you
gonna check it?
No, I, uh... I trust you.
Mm. Famous last words.
Without you,
I would have lost it.
I swear.
You know, everybody staring at me
like I was an animal at the zoo.
Why didn't ya at least tell
your Ma about the baby?
She would have insisted
on me coming home.
You know, I wasn't ready.
Mm.
She's tiny.
It's a he.
He's just over 10 pounds.
Oh. H-has he got a name?
No. Not yet.
I was kind of expecting a girl.
Listen, if you need anything...
food, turf, stuff for the baby...
- you let me know.
- You're too kind.
No, I'm not.
Actually, there is something
you could do for me.
Yeah?
Do you mind just holding him.
I'll be a sec.
Just mind his neck, okay?
- Mind his neck. Okay.
- Got him?
Oh, I got him. Yeah.
I'll be one minute.
Okay.
Ooh.
Hang on, there.
It's all right.
Right there.
I gotcha.
Would you like some breakfast?
I got to go.
Without eating?
Without eating.
They're made cute
so that we can't reject them
later no matter how much
they just cry, crap, and puke.
Yeah.
Nature's pretty clever that way,
isn't it?
There you go.
Okay.
You all right?
Yeah. I got him. Thanks.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
Money.
Oh. What on earth for?
Rent, food...
you know, I'm... I'm old enough
to contribute now, so.
Sean, listen, this is not your job.
Your job is to go to school.
But thanks.
I think I'm just about
ready to pack it in.
Don't be such a lightweight.
If we give up now,
it'll all be for naught.
There's always a fine line
between tenacity and stupidity,
but this time I'm pretty sure
we've crossed it.
Michael.
Diner special?
The usual?
No. Nope. I'm fine.
Just a couple of pints
of guinness, please.
Is it true?
Found a body?
Yeah.
Well, so far only a hand.
We can't uncover it completely
until we secure her
for preservation.
What makes you think it's a her?
I don't know.
The size, I guess.
I mean, technically speaking,
you're right.
We don't know yet.
We need a bunch of equipment
from the museum,
hopkin needs to sign
the paperwork,
then we can book
a paleobiologist.
Does that mean you're done
messing around my place?
Maybe.
By the way,
have you been to see
Deirdre's baby yet?
Not yet.
You should.
I'd say he's got your eyes.
But, hey, didn't you find
that girl that went missing
there a few years back?
It's not her. It's older.
How do you know?
I know.
Trust her.
She knows... Everything.
Maybe it's a sacrifice
like the one in breton.
Listen, there's no sign
of a recent burial,
which is to say this body's
at least 100 years old.
Told ya.
I know.
- To what begins to be.
- To what begins to be.
Yes?
Dad, stop.
Dad, please.
I can't talk to you right now
about this.
I'm gonna get off the phone.
Bye.
Hi. I have...
Oh, excuse me.
Sorry.
Turning it off.
I have an appointment
with Dr. gupta.
Do you need a lift?
Actually, I was just on
my way to your house.
Why?
I need no charity, Liam.
What are you talking about?
This isn't yours?
No. What's in it?
Fine.
I...
yeah, okay, I'll take the lift.
I hear he has my eyes.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Why wouldn't you
tell me yourself?
You never asked.
Are you ready?
Yes. Yes.
Hold on. Where do you
think you're going?
Uh, only down for a look.
- Hiya.
- Hiya.
- How is, uh... how's the baby?
- He's grand.
- Liam, come here.
- Has he got a name yet?
Dermot.
Yes?
What?
No, his name is Dermot.
Ah, don't be daft.
Don't make a fuss, okay?
It's Dermot.
Ah, no.
What we have here is a shoulder.
Fay, can you give us a hand?
Dermot, this is Jack Hopkin
from the national museum.
Jack this is Dermot Fay.
We used to teach together
at trinity.
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
Dermot, can you start
in that top corner?
I'm looking for an approximate
on the head.
Once we've got the parameters
of the body,
<i>we can cut out a square of turf
and move it in situ.</i>
I don't think we've
had the pleasure.
I'm terribly sorry, Dermot.
This is David McGlynn,
the paleobiologist.
David this is Dermot Fay.
We used to...
I know all about you.
Nice to finally meet you.
Oh. Nice to meet you.
No, nothing yet.
It's nothing.
It's got to be just
that time of year.
I better get on with it.
- See you later.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Somebody's gettin'
lucky tonight.
Don't you dare.
We haven't all got one-track
minds like you, you know.
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.
I might go back to Dublin.
Why?
I'm as lost here
as I would be there.
It'd make things a
lot easier for Abbey.
If she comes back.
Yeah.
If she comes back.
But I'm going all the same.
She's right.
It's time.
Yes, it is.
Michael.
I found it.
Jesus.
Jack, get over here.
Surrounded by the muck of history.
Just like us.
You okay?
Yeah.
Can you believe it?
You actually found a bog body.
No. Not really.
You know, I'd like to go to the
national museum someday
and check her out, you know,
when she's all cleaned up.
Ah. Maybe someday I'll take ya.
So, uh, what happened
to the baby?
What baby?
You know the one you had
with the student of yours.
You know, Dermot,
I don't know what it is
that's keeping you from
going back to Dublin,
but whatever it is,
it's not worth ruining
the rest of your life for.
His name is Rory.
That's about all I know.
Sophie put him up for adoption,
so for all I know,
he's not even Rory anymore.
And do you miss him?
Can you miss someone
you've never met?
Sort of like my dad.
Huh?
No. I'm... I'm just messing.
I know my dad.
It's just...
he's not around a whole lot.
You're a bastard.
You're a bastard yourself.
Dermot?
What?
You mind if I take a leak?
Do I mind?
I think now that you're done,
Liam's gonna build a cottage
for himself.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, I guess people
have to make a living.
Even here.
Now me, I'd rather be
an archeologist.
Would ya?
