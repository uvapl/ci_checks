- Thank you.
Hi, Ruth.
- Mr. Bonin.
I, um...
I wrote the letter
to the governor
just like you suggested.
- Mm-hmm?
- I said everything in it
that you said to say.
I even put in
the Bible verses
that your lawyer
had suggested.
- The one about mercy?
- I don't remember
the exact words,
but I brought the letter
for you to see,
because I think it's good.
I think it will
be very effective.
- They'll get it
to me later.
I've done everything
I can do.
- So...
- Mr. Bonin?
- How are things
at the library?
- I have done everything
that you asked me to do,
Mr. Bonin.
And now I think--
I believe that you
owe me something.
- I owe you something?
- I feel that you do.
- Ruth...
I never asked you
to do anything.
- I know.
- I just knew
that you had questions,
things that you felt
I could
put your mind to rest about.
And all I said was that
it would be impossible
for me to answer yours
or anybody else's questions
if I was, in fact,
dead.
Was I wrong about that?
- No.
No, you weren't.
I brought some pictures that
I don't believe you've seen.
- Of?
- My son.
These two are old.
I mean,
he was very young there,
but this one,
this is what he would have...
looked like then.
Please look at the pictures,
Mr. Bonin.
- You know that I only have
three weeks to live, huh?
- Please, Mr. Bonin, please.
I need to know.
I know you don't have
any good news for me.
I just need to know.
It's the thinking.
I just--
It won't let me sleep.
That's what it is.
I'm tired.
Take another look.
Do you recognize this boy?
- Faces.
So many faces.
They all just get so...
mixed up.
- It's kind of
counterproductive,
don't you think?
- Yeah, I guess.
Look,
why don't we partner up?
You know,
somebody stops for me
and I'll take you along,
and you do the same for me.
- All right.
- Cool.
- Oh, hey.
Thanks for stopping.
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- You guys want a ride?
- Definitely.
- How you guys doing?
- Better now, man.
Thanks for picking us up.
- Oh, you're welcome.
You guys been hitching
for a while?
- Yeah, a while.
- Wow.
That's got to be tough waiting
for a ride though, isn't it?
I mean, doesn't that give you
kind of, like,
a little bit of a--
I don't know.
Like, a helpless feeling
or something?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- So you guys like
to party?
Yeah, man.
- Hell yeah.
- Look at that.
The Siberian wolf.
The most solitary beast
on the planet, they say.
- Can't be too solitary,
otherwise there'd be
no other Siberian wolves,
now would there?
- You got that right.
- All I know, man,
is you saved our asses.
I was getting
to the point personally
where I would have taken
a ride with anybody.
- Well, you got
to be careful these days.
- No shit.
They still haven't
caught that guy.
- Haven't caught what guy?
- That guy killing dudes,
leaving 'em by
the side of the road.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard about that.
Where'd you read that?
In the newspapers?
- No, I don't read newspapers
too much.
It was on TV.
- No shit?
What channel?
- I don't know.
I don't remember, man.
- What do you mean,
you don't remember?
What the fuck
use are you?
- Oh!
- Help me!
Help me!
- You gonna help
or watch, Vern?
- Just gonna watch for now.
- God!
Stop moving!
- Did you see that?
He kind of came up
on me there at the end.
- No.
You had him, Bill.
I'd have pitched in
if it got too hairy.
- Oh, man.
He's heavy for
a scrawny little fuck.
Look at those boots.
They're huge.
- Pretty badass.
Pretty cool actually.
I wouldn't mind keeping these.
- You wouldn't mind what?
- I wouldn't, though.
I know the rules.
- Yeah,
I know you wouldn't.
Hey, you want to get
a burger or something?
- Ah, Bill,
I'm pretty tired.
I've just been fucking around
with this kid all day.
Just kind of want to go to--
just want to go home.
- Come on.
Let's get a burger.
- Just watch.
I'll be out of that embassy
in six weeks,
just in time
for Reagan's inauguration.
You watch.
- Why you been talking about
politics, huh?
How about common sense?
Like wanting to take
that kid's boots back there.
What, are you
out of your mind?
- Look, it was your idea
to get a burger.
I'm not gonna argue
about stupid shit.
I already told you
I'm not gonna take the boots.
I know the fucking rules.
- Then why'd you even
bring it up?
- I just thought
the boots were nice.
That's it.
All right?
- Fine.
Hey, what was that kid's
name again?
- Steven?
- Steven, right.
Well...
Thank you, Stevie-poo.
Wherever you're at.
- Kyle, can I have a word?
You take the scenic route?
You were gone over an hour.
- There was traffic.
- Traffic?
You can't come up with a more
original excuse than that?
You fuck up so consistently
it's like you practice at it.
Get over here.
You're staying
an hour later tonight
to pay me back for the hour
you fucking cheated me out of.
Next time
think of a better story, okay?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- You know we're fucked now?
We're never gonna make it.
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
Yeah, I wanted to see
that fucking movie.
Did you tell your boss
that you had a date?
- Oh, my God.
You are such a pussy!
- Great.
Thanks.
- Let's go.
There's a midnight show.
Maybe we can catch that.
Where do you think
you're going?
- I'm gonna walk home.
- Oh, you think
I'm gonna try
to talk you out of it?
Yeah, watch this!
- Do you want a ride?
All right,
if you don't want a ride,
you don't want a ride.
Just looks like you could use
a friend is all.
Check this out.
What do you get when you cross
a penis and a potato?
- I don't know.
- A dictator.
Hey, man,
you want a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke.
- Good for you.
Smart boy.
I like that.
That fellow back
at the store,
he sure rides your ass
pretty hard.
- Yeah.
- That's got to be tough.
Somebody treated
me like that...
Makes you really want to--
I'd like to strike right back
at 'em, you know?
- It's just left up here.
- All right.
You live with your folks?
- Yeah, my mom.
My dad kind of walked out.
- Which is to say that
you had to grow up
pretty fast, huh?
- Sometimes it feels
like that, yeah.
- Is your mom expecting you?
- She can expect whatever
she wants.
-
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Now...
we have a couple of choices.
The path we take depends
on your answer to this question.
When you say you
don't smoke,
do you mean just cigarettes?
- Yeah.
- You don't sleep too good
at night, do you?
- I just lay awake at night
and think about shit.
I don't know.
I wish that l--
- Yeah?
- I just wish
I could tell somebody
about the shit
that goes on in my head.
- Yeah?
Why don't you?
- Because--
because if I told somebody,
then they'd--
because they'd probably call
the men in white lab coats,
maybe the police.
- Really?
- It's bad.
Some of it.
- Well, like--
like what exactly?
- I don't know.
- Now, that's the first
outright lie you've told me.
Isn't it?
Isn't it?
I don't know.
- It's just--it's--
- Sick?
Let me tell you something
about sick.
Sick is just a question
of community standards.
And even just two people
like you and me,
we can be a community.
And then we can think
whatever the hell we want.
- Let's get you home,
buddy.
So where's your mom?
- Oh, she works graveyard.
- So your mom gets the day shift
telling you what to do,
and the girlfriend,
little miss tight ass--
whatever her name is--
she takes over at nights.
Is that the deal?
- Her name's Lisa.
- I don't give a fuck
what her name is.
"Lisa."
Figures.
- You know, she's actually
been waiting for me
to take her to see
Urban Cowboy,
and I probably should.
- Urban Cowboy?
Really?
- Yeah, I know.
I'm not--
I don't even really want to go,
to be honest,
but I kind of promised her.
- After how that bitch
treated you?
Fuck her.
Call her.
Tell her
you don't want to go.
Tell her
you don't want to go.
Tell her that Urban Cowboy
is for pussies.
And you ain't
no pussy, huh?
- No, I just--
I don't want to go.
No, I'm--
I know.
It's just something--
something came up.
- What has come up?
Are you high?
What the fuck
are you talking about?
You can't have something
come up when you make a plan--
- I told you once.
I'm not gonna say it again.
No.
Fuck--fuck you!
Listen, okay?
I'm gonna do whatever it is
I fucking want to do,
and that's all
there is to it.
- You're gonna do
what I say you're gonna--
- Cunt!
- What!
- "Cunt" was
a little bit harsh.
A little harsh.
Just kidding.
- Oh, my God.
I can't--
I can't believe
I just did that.
What are we doing?
- What's up?
- Kyle, Vern.
Vern, Kyle.
Don't worry.
He's cool.
Chill out, Vern.
- You'll have
to excuse the mess.
Maid's day off.
You're wondering to yourself,
"What's the deal
with this dude?"
Well, I'm a wizard.
You ever met a wizard before?
A real-life wizard?
A wizard has the mists
of Thule in his soul.
You can see it in his eyes.
Look in my eyes.
Can you see it?
- Um...
- Can you see it?
- Um...
I guess.
- Yeah?
- Okay, yeah.
- I had you going.
I had him going,
right, Bill?
- Hey, Vern.
Why don't you show him
the family album?
Go ahead.
Show him.
It's okay.
- Bill and me have been at this
for quite a while.
I guess you could call me
the chronicler.
Here.
See the striations here?
Guess what that is.
Yeah, you ponder that
for a while.
How about this one?
- My God.
- You like that one, huh?
Pick a card.
Kyle.
Pick a card.
- Any card?
- No, no, no.
You're gonna pick the card
I want you to pick.
- I am, am l?
- Yeah.
Queen of diamonds.
Ohh.
Queen of diamonds it is.
- Hey, how many bites
you think it'd take you
to scarf that thing down?
- Oh, what?
Like, without stopping?
- No.
How many bites to wolf
that shit down?
Seriously.
- I don't know, man.
Like, maybe, like,
four or five.
- Four or five?
- Yeah.
- I bet I can do it
in three.
Two, one.
- Oh, my God.
Look. Look.
Look at him.
Oh, my God.
It looks like he's digging
for buried treasure.
I bet you anything
that's the most enthusiasm
that guy's shown
for anything
in his pathetic life.
- Yeah.
Probably.
- Oh, yeah?
What, do you think
you're better than him?
It's not a trick question.
You should be able
to answer that one, right?
- Yeah.
I think I'm better than him.
- You think?
- Okay, I know.
- It's nothing to me.
I don't really give a shit
one way or the other.
- I'm--I'm better than him,
obviously.
- Well, you never know.
He might have been
a bank president once.
- That's nothing.
- Exactly.
Now you're getting it.
Now you see.
Most people
are overconfident
of their value
on the planet.
Most people...
can be done without.
Hey, you want to have
some real fun?
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna have some
real fun.
Here you go.
Take that.
Go ahead.
Take it.
There you go.
In my business, they say that
is the trucker's best friend.
Yeah.
Feel better already,
right?
You see that one?
Going to the park, huh?
- Yeah,
I got a season pass.
- Wow.
You got a season pass?
Wow.
You must go all the time.
- Yeah, the roller coasters
are the best.
- Hmm, I don't know how
I feel about that,
having a season pass.
I mean, ain't you afraid
that kind of takes
all the specialness
out of it?
I mean, don't you think
the park should be special?
I do.
- I don't think so.
I like going all the time.
- Really?
- Get his legs.
Get his legs.
Fast!
Come on!
- I'm trying!
- That's it.
Good, Kyle. Good, Kyle.
Yeah.
Good, Kyle.
- I swear--
- This kid's gonna die.
- Please let me go.
I won't tell anyone,
I promise!
- Oh, well, gee,
if you promise,
I guess we can let him
go then, right?
- I swear I won't!
- I mean it.
- I know you won't.
Yak, yak, yak.
Shut up.
- All right,
you're up.
You are about to walk through
a door right now.
Do you know what's
on the other side?
Becoming God is all.
'Cause right now
you are God of his world,
and you better fucking believe
he will pray to you.
- Please let me go.
Please let me go.
Please let me go.
Please let me go.
- Seeing that?
There is the world
most people live in,
and then there is this.
Fuck or be fucked.
It's up to you.
Door number one...
or run out door number two,
the pussy door.
I won't stop you, Kyle.
I won't stop you.
I won't stop you.
I won't stop you.
- No!
- Get him! Come on!
You can do it!
Come on!
Get him!
- Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- I got it.
I got it.
You're screwed now, kid.
Once you get a taste...
you can't get enough.
Don't let Vern bug you,
by the way.
- What's this?
- Well, one of you is gonna
have to sit in the back.
Obviously.
- You're looking at me.
- Well, you're the one
on the outside, Vern.
Ha.
- This is my seat.
It's my seat.
I'm just saying somebody
should ask
if they want
to take my seat.
- Mind sitting in the back?
Did you see that?
- I don't even fucking know
what to say.
I am looking at you,
and I don't know what to say.
Well?
- God.
Wow.
- I know what the deal is
with you and the kid, Bill.
- Oh, well, you know everything,
Mr. Wizard.
- You just wanted to see
if he could do it.
- Well, shit's boring
right now.
Let's spice things up
a little bit.
- Well, you're gonna spice
your way
right into the gas chamber
if you’re not careful.
I know you.
- What do you mean,
you know me?
- Always got to stick
your goddamn hand in the fire.
- Jesus, Vern.
What, do you want
to live forever?
- You're so full of shit, man.
You wouldn't have spent
two seconds with this kid
if you weren't getting
something out of it.
- Can you believe that?
- You cut off his finger
in front of everybody?
- In front of everybody,
and everybody in the bar
applauded too.
They're like...
Cut the shit-bag's
finger off
right below the knuckle,
and then I told him,
and I said, "This is a tax
on your stupidity."
But then I told him--
I said, "Hey, you know what?
I'm a reasonable guy.
"l know in the future
you're gonna be needing
"that finger for dialing
phones and so forth,
"so I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.
"You give me ten bucks,
I'll pack it in ice
for you real nice."
- You sold him back
his own finger?
- Sold him back
his own finger.
- Hey, man,
what do you look for?
- What do I look for?
What do you mean?
- You know...
what do you look for
when you look for a--
you look for a--
- I know what
you're talking about.
You look for
a lot of things,
but the first thing
to remember is
who's the wolf
and who's the sheep.
We're the wolves.
They're the sheep.
Got to say to yourself,
"ls that sheep alone?
"ls the sheep in the vicinity
of other sheeps?
Does that little fur ball
get you turned on?"
'Cause if it
don't give you a boner,
what's the point?
You know?
Something about the person
will stick out at you.
What you'll do is,
you'll figure out
what works for you.
That's the key,
what works for you.
Look over there.
Look at that. Look at that.
Look, look, look.
Yeah.
- Any one of them.
- Any damn one.
- His dad was probably
a Nazi.
- If it makes you feel
any better.
- I'm just saying.
He was probably
all baby-faced too,
putting people in ovens.
- You want to talk
about war?
My unit rolled into
this hamlet
three clicks north
of Khe Sanh.
This little
baby-faced mama-san
come running up to the tent.
"Hello, G.I.
Hello, G.I."
Pulls out a grenade and
takes out two fucking FNGs.
I cut her in half
with my M-16.
- What's an FNG?
- "Fucking new guy."
- Body was found
on southbound freeways...
- Hello?
- Go turn on the TV right now,
channel five.
There's a story about us.
- I'm pretty much
going to bed, Bill.
Why don't you call
your new playmate?
- Will you turn on
the fucking TV, Vern?
- Channel five?
- Yes, channel five.
- The victim was tortured...
- You believe this?
They still haven't even
tied us to anything in L.A.
It's just all that
Orange County crap.
- Well, that's good for us,
though, right?
- Still, it'd be nice
to get a little recognition
just the same, you know?
- Found murdered
along Orange County freeways.
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh.
I must have dozed off.
They were showing
the hostages.
- Hostages, shmostages.
- You okay?
- Aren't you working?
- I just finished a run.
Thought I'd just
come by and say hi.
- You were half expecting
to find my dead body.
Tell the truth.
- I don't know why you always
got to say that.
It's not necessary.
- That's what I do.
I keep things entertaining.
- Yeah, no doubt
about that.
It's just not good to spend
too much time alone.
- You're not alone, Ma.
I'm here.
- It was always
when I was on my own
that I'd get into trouble.
- Really?
- It's like there
was these demons
that were always
just hovering around.
- The demons, huh?
- God, you know,
your father was--
your biological father
was a real piece of shit.
- Yeah, I know.
- But then
there was Daniel.
He was different.
He was just
a real nice guy.
It was after he left
that everything turned to shit.
And then it was just me
and those demons.
They can take many
different forms.
- Bottles mostly, right?
- It was them that made me do
so many regrettable things,
like leaving you.
- Hmm, I don't know if that
will hold up in court.
I would hate me
if I were you.
- I'm not you.
- So this will show you
your hit points.
Like Kyle's
got seven charisma
and eight dex--
Can you not touch that?
Could you just put it down?
Thanks.
So, Bill, let's say
you come into combat
with a level-ten mage.
- What if we decide
to talk it out?
We don't want to go to war.
I'll wait till you guys
are finished, huh?
- No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait,
so I got a question.
I got a question.
I got this orc,
all right.
I don't want to be the orc.
I want to be
the black wizard,
okay, or the warrior.
Or something with the mists
of Thule in their eyes.
- Yeah, you guys
just keep laughing.
You're, like,
1,000 vitality points away
from doing shit, so...
- Ooh, vitality points.
- Fuck you, Bill!
Fuck you!
You and your little shit,
fuck you to hell.
- Sit your ass down.
- I'm not gonna
sit my ass down.
This is my house!
I will not sit my ass down
in my fucking house!
- Whatever.
You coming or what?
- Oh, you're gonna leave?
Oh, Kyle, hold on, hold on.
You want to know about Bill?
Sit down.
I'll tell you
all about Bill.
You want to know about
this fucking asshole, huh?
He tell you about
all the war stories,
I suppose, huh?
- Don't even go there.
- I'll bet he told you
all the stories, huh?
Yeah, he was there.
But the closest
he ever got to combat
was sticking his pistol
to a couple of buck privates,
making them suck his dick.
Yeah, I don't think
they give medals for that
last time I checked.
See the thing
about Bill is, Kyle,
he's got
this fucking sickness
all fucking stirred up
inside him, and he thinks,
"l think I got all control
in the world."
Don't you, Bill?
You think you got control
of that shit.
That's not true.
It controls him
like a little fucking bitch.
- Fuck you!
Ah!
Who's the bitch now, huh?
Who's the bitch now?
You're the bitch now, Vern.
You're the bitch.
Who's a bitch now, Vern?
Who's the bitch now, bitch?
Bitch.
Let's go.
Let's go!
- What the fuck?
God damn it.
Oh, you've got something
to say, huh?
Go ahead, say it.
What?
- You think that was smart,
leaving him back there
like that?
- Why don't you mind
your own fucking business?
- I'd say this was
my business.
You just made
an enemy of a man
that could put us both
in the gas chamber.
- Relax.
Nobody's putting anybody
in the gas chamber, all right?
Vern and me go back, man.
Way back.
I did my first kill with him.
That's a bond.
I know he got squirrelly
back there.
But he's a genius, really.
He can read books--
astrology, philosophy.
What the fuck
do you know, punk?
I mean, I've seen him
read minds, man.
It's not a parlor trick.
Now what?
I'm supposed to--
supposed to kill him
on your say-so, huh?
Some little shit-heeled punk,
running off his mouth,
telling me what the fuck
I should and shouldn't do.
Is that it, huh?
A man's your partner
for six fucking years!
Six fucking years!
Fuck.
Fuck!
Ah!
Vern?
Oh, Vern?
- What are you doing here,
Bill?
- Oh, I thought you know
everything, Mr. Wizard.
What are you planning
on doing with that?
- You didn't knock
or anything.
I thought you might
have been a burglar.
- Burglar?
- You want a beer
or something?
- Nope.
What's the point?
- Hey.
- Fuck you, kid.
I knew that fucking punk
was trouble
from the word "go."
- He's got nothing
to do with this,
and you know it.
- I know a demon
visited my house
when I was 11 years old.
- Oh, yeah?
- A real demon.
He said his name
was Azazel.
He had long,
white, wizardry hair,
a nose like a bat,
like a bat's nose.
But it was you, Bill.
I recognized you
the second I laid eyes on you.
I keep thinking
about that guy.
- What guy?
- The guy
with the orthopedic thing
on his fucking leg.
You know the guy
I'm talking about?
- I believe I do.
- Pushing on his chest,
all that black shit
came out of his mouth.
Jesus Christ, Bill,
who sees things like that?
- Well, I guess you and me.
We've been places
most people never get to go.
- You were like
my tour guide.
- I still am.
Go get dressed.
Now.
- What the fuck?
- Shh.
- Fuck.
Ow, fuck.
God--
- What the fuck
are you doing?
- Oh, God.
Be right out.
- I'll be right out.
- What did you do?
What did you do?
Let me see.
Let me see,
for crying out loud!
Sit down.
God damn it, Vern.
Jesus, Vern.
- Stupid, stupid.
- Put this right here.
What are you thinking,
man?
You're like a stupid kid.
Fucking child, man.
It's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be all right.
- Harder.
That.
Like that.
That.
Okay, like that.
No, that.
Kyle, Jesus.
Who is that?
- God.
- Pick up the phone,
God damn it.
- So stupid.
- That supposed to be
the ayatollah?
- Supposed to be
Tom Krepnecke.
Same fucking thing.
- Who the fuck
is Tom Krepnecke?
- My boss.
Ex-boss.
Nazi motherfucker.
- Well, I see you're a man
not to be taken lightly.
Let's see some I.D.
- You a cop?
- Shit.
- William Pugh.
Get in.
- Shit.
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny.
Oh, no!
No, Johnny!
Help me!
- Gonna go out for a bit.
Be back in a flash.
- You gonna get more beer?
- Billy.
Alex.
Alex, Billy.
Go in the other room.
I'll be right there
in a second.
I'm gonna kill that kid.
You want a piece of it?
It's gonna be great.
- How you doing in there,
pumpkin?
- We fucking killed
that guy.
- You said a mouthful.
We fucking killed
that guy,
didn't we?
William Jennings Pugh, Jr.,
we fucking killed that guy,
didn't we?
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
Come on, now,
don't leave me hanging.
Yeah, that's my boy.
Yeah.
Hey, come back here!
Hey!
God damn it.
Fuck.
- What do you want, Bill?
- Hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?
- What's going on, Bill?
- Nothing.
I don't know.
That fucking kid,
he ran out on me.
- That kid Kyle?
- No, another one.
- Jesus Christ.
Bill,
how many the fuck you got
running around
with you now?
- Well, one too many,
obviously.
This kid could be
telling anybody.
We don't know
who he's talking to.
- You know the rules,
Bill.
No loose ends,
remember?
- Rules?
Hey, I know the fucking rules,
all right!
I--I just--
I--I got to go out.
I got to get some, you know?
I got to get some.
You know how that is,
Vern.
You know how it is,
don't you?
- Bill, Bill,
you got to take care of this,
okay?
You got to go kill
that kid.
- You know, maybe that's
not such a bad idea.
Whoa.
What's going on?
Is, uh--is--
is William here?
- Billy?
- Billy, right.
Right.
Is he here?
- What do you want with him?
- l, uh...
well, oh, actually,
he, um...
dropped his license
while we were hanging out
at the donut shop.
- License, huh?
Well, good luck with that.
You want to have
your personal conversation
with the piece of shit,
you got to go
through sheriff's deputies.
- Deputies?
Why? What--
is he in county?
- The genius got busted
trying to boost a car,
a bug,
if you can believe that.
- A bug?
He really got arrested?
- Yeah, that's usually
how they work it.
- I can't believe this.
Unbelievable.
- What do you want with him?
Who are you, man?
- Fuck.
Why did l--
Fuck.
Why?
Why'd you pick
the stupid shit?
- Reports are emerging
about the connection
between the rash of bodies
in Orange County
and several bodies
found dumped along
Los Angeles freeways.
L.A.P.D. sources have confirmed
a task force has been set up
to catch a serial killer
who is--
- Hey, hey, I was looking
for The Orange County Register.
Thanks.
I appreciate that.
Can I help you?
- Huh?
- You seemed interested
in me, obviously.
- Oh, no, no, I'm sorry.
I was just looking
at your paper.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
They catch that guy yet?
- Uh, I don't know.
I don't even think
they gave him a name yet.
- Hmm, The Register, yeah.
You know
they broke the story?
- Yeah, they did.
- Yeah, that's--
that's a good paper.
Yeah, a good paper.
I used to live over that way.
- Oh, did you?
- Hermosa Beach.
- Really?
Where you living now?
- Ah, just up the street here.
Anaheim.
- What street?
- What?
- What street you living on?
Ah, no, really,
you know what?
It's really none
of your business where I live
and what street I live on.
Have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.
Good answer.
Officer!
See ya.
Come on, Vernon,
pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the fucking phone,
God damn it.
Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.
- Hey.
- Whoa.
- How you keeping yourself?
- Hey, why don't you go
to the car, okay?
- I'll be there in a second.
- What's going on?
- Who is this guy?
- Just--
just go to the car, honey.
Look, I don't appreciate you
coming around here.
- Wow.
Got your own car, huh?
Your mom buy it for you?
- I bought it
with my own money.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They made me manager.
- Wow.
Good for you.
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
It's not about what I want,
Kyle.
It's about what the state
of California wants.
- What are you talking about?
- I'd give
better than even money
I'm being watched by police
right now,
maybe not this second.
- Kyle, what the fuck?
- Just a second.
Cut the bullshit, Bill.
Look, I'm not
coming back with you.
- God, you're so arrogant.
That's not
what this is about.
I trained another kid,
and he got busted.
Now somebody's
got it in their mind
that I'm the big, bad
Freeway Killer,
but I got a plan.
What you got to do is,
you got to grab somebody,
a hitchhiker.
I don't give a fuck
who it is.
You understand?
Make it look like
the Freeway Killer's out there.
You understand?
T-shirt around the neck.
Choke 'em with a tire iron.
Dump their body on the freeway.
You make it real obvious
that the Freeway Killer's
still out there.
- Shh.
- And then you and me
will be done
with this thing forever.
Look, man,
it's the only fucking way.
- Kyle, I'm out of here.
- It's the only way.
God, after everything
we've been through.
- I'm done with that.
I'm not coming back
with you.
Okay?
It's over.
- Remember me and you?
- I don't think I'm gonna
be able to help you out
with that--that thing.
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.
Where are we going anyway?
- Oh, just up here a ways,
not too far.
- What's going on?
- What's going on?
Oh, nothing.
Just one of those days,
you know?
One of those days.
Hey, you like to get high?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Wow.
You don't know.
Well, I'm gonna get high.
You don't want to get high,
you can just sit here
and watch me get high.
How 'bout that?
What's your name, man?
- Sean.
- Sean.
Where you from?
- Anywhere but here.
- Here, have a hit.
- Take it.
- Cool.
- You know,
I like that red coat, man.
That red coat
is really cool.
- Thanks.
- Do you know what
the most solitary predator
on Earth is?
What?
- I used to think
it was the wolf,
but it's not.
It's not the wolf.
It was never the wolf.
It was never the wolf.
It was never the wolf.
It was never the wolf.
- Hey, man, um...
I really don't want
to be a bother.
You know, it's okay.
I've got a friend
that lives right here.
I don't want to--
I don't want to bother you.
- You're not bothering me.
It's fine.
- I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna go.
- No, you're not.
No, you're not.
You're not going anywhere!
- No, you're not!
- Get off me!
- You're not!
No, you're not.
You're not going anywhere.
- Help!
Help me!
- You're not going anywhere.
- Help me!
- Shut up!
You're not going anywhere!
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.
- Please.
- You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.
- You're not going anywhere.
Ah!
- Get out of the van now!
- Drop the weapon!
- Get him out.
Get him out of there.
Get him down on the ground.
Get him on the ground.
- Put your hands
behind your back.
- I admit, I've always been
kind of a loner,
lonely type of guy.
Maybe that's why
I was so easily reeled in,
I don't know.
- So if you're guilty
of anything,
it's loneliness.
- Reaching out
to the wrong people maybe.
Yeah.
- You know, you really
don't have a lot of luck
with your associations,
do you?
Why don't you, um--
why don't you tell me
a little bit more
about Vernon Butts.
- Well, what do
you want to know?
I mean, we only
hung out randomly.
- Well, that's not the way
you made it seem
when you first
gave us his name.
- You asked
for acquaintances,
and I gave them to you.
- You do know that Vernon's
not quite as tight-lipped
as you, don't you?
- That's Vernon.
Mr. Politics.
He loves to talk.
- He sure as hell does,
friend.
He says you did
most of the actual killing.
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's got his memories.
I've got mine.
- You know
something that's funny?
Well...
funny from my perspective.
I'm actually trying
to save your life.
- Really?
Well, thanks.
I appreciate that.
- Yeah.
This is the truth, Bill.
The truth that's
gonna set you free,
or at least keep your ass
out of the gas chamber.
Hmm?
Your juvenile arrest records,
psych reports going back,
what, 20 years,
look at 'em, Bill.
They paint quite a picture.
Neglect, abuse,
pedophile grandfather,
alcoholic mother.
Real true-life horror story.
It's a shame.
- You keep my mom
out of this,
or I'm not gonna
say another word.
- Well, that's very noble
of you.
- I'm not gonna
let you drag her
through some
fucking circus freak show
like you always do,
parading everything around.
I'm not
gonna let you do it.
- Well, then you're gonna die,
Billy boy.
- You ain't supposed
to live forever anyway, right?
- Huh.
You know what I hear?
- What do you hear?
- There's a little rumor
that they're looking
for someone
to be a guinea pig
for the first lethal injection.
Yeah.
And from where I sit,
you're the poster boy.
That really makes me something
then, huh?
- It sure does.
Vernon, Pugh, Peterson,
they all peg you
as the murderer.
And the only chance you have
of getting out of here
is what you're looking at
right now.
Now you're gonna
have to fess up
if you want
to make it out of this.
Look at me.
I am out on the runway
with my two flashlights
trying to signal
your ass home,
and all you keep doing
is wanting to dive nose first
into the ground.
What is this?
I don't get it.
- There's always
other alternatives,
Detective Saint John.
Pugh and Peterson,
they were punks.
And they were true to form,
of course.
They went down whining,
pointing fingers.
Old Vern,
he would have none of that.
By the time they put him
in his cell,
well, he was already
someplace else.
- Come on, Bill.
You and l,
we've come a long way.
What do you say
we give these people
some closure, hmm?
It's time.
- But I got to get something
in return, okay?
So that was the key
to everything.
They wanted something
from me,
and I wanted something
from them.
They kept writing me
letter after letter,
waiting on me,
like the return of Jesus.
They kept shoving
pictures in my face
of kid after kid
like it was gonna bring them
back or something.
All these parents,
they all wanted closure.
Well, that's fine.
But I was sure gonna get
paid back for all my troubles.
- You--
you traded a body
for a cheeseburger?
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Is this a game to you?
You make me listen
to all those stories,
and then what,
I'm supposed to pick my son
out of all your victims?
- I never said
he was any of them.
- You said--
- I said maybe
he was one of them.
- Why are you doing this?
- Vern's gone.
Kyle is gone.
Everyone's gone.
I don't have anybody.
Always staring at walls--
- Wait, wait.
Are you telling me
that you have been playing me
all this time
because you wanted
someone to talk to?
- Well, it has been nice
having some company.
- Ah.
- I remember your boy.
I do, Ruth.
I remember him.
I've always remembered him.
I know who he is.
I know exactly who he is.
I just wanted company is all.
I guess we did have a bargain,
didn't we?
- What do you remember?
- I remember it was raining,
and that's why
he wasn't so picky
when he took a ride from me.
I remember he was wearing
a windbreaker.
Was it blue?
- It was blue.
- He had a light coat
that was blue.
That's the last thing
I saw him wearing.
It wasn't
a windbreaker though.
- No, it wasn't
a windbreaker exactly,
but it was thin material,
light.
But I remember
picking him up.
And we drove around,
and we had a good time.
I got him really high.
And we went through
the drive-through,
and we ate a couple burgers.
And we had
a lot of laughs.
We had a lot of laughs.
God, he was cute.
And I hit him in the head
with a tire iron.
And I put the T-shirt
around his neck,
and I strangled him,
because that's what I do.
And it all happened
very fast.
He didn't really suffer.
But he did cry.
And I remember
he was saying...
- What?
What did he say?
- He said,
"Sorry, Mom, sorry."
Is this supposed to be
making me feel better,
this fucking fairy tale
that you're telling me?
- What?
You wanted to know.
Now you know.
- My son never, ever,
ever once in his life
called me "Mom."
I wouldn't let him.
As it happens,
I made him call me "Ruth."
He was my whole world,
and you took him from me,
you sick animal!
He was my friend,
and he was my son.
You fuck!
You sick fuck!
I hate you.
- I'm sorry, Ruth.
I may have crossed paths
with your boy, Ruth.
I don't know.
- I am gonna
watch you suffocate.
You pathetic monster,
you have made my life hell
all these years.
I have listened
to your perverted stories.
You wanted company
when you die.
Well, I'll tell you,
I'm gonna be there,
and I am gonna
watch you die.
- Well, here's a tip for you.
When you do,
watch the eyes.
That's where it all happens.
