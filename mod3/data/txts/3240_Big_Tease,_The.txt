When Martin Samuels makes a documentary
about a Scottish artiste...
...you have to ask yourself:
''Who is this guy?''
''What's all the fuss about?''
Well, that guy is me.
l'm Crawford Mackenzie.
l'm a hairdresser.
''Dear Mr. Mackenzie:
The World lnternational
Hairdressing Federation...
...has selected you to participate...
...in this year's Platinum Scissors
Competition in Los Angeles.
For those invited....
On a personal note...
...l look forward to meeting you
upon your arrival in the U.S.
Sincerely, Monique Geingold,
president, W.H.l.F.'' lt's WHlF.
Good to see you.
This is what l do all day.
You look fantastic. You're like
a scary alien with your hat.
Agent from outer space.
This is a look l've been working on.
l call it ''New Zealand.'' All black.
Margaret.
lt's a funny thing about her.
She comes in here every week,
you give a permanent...
...then she's in the bathroom
for half an hour.
How'd you come by this nickname?
Well, they call me
the ''Red Adair of Hair'' ...
...because if there's a problem,
l'm the one they call in.
Obviously, it's a different area
of expertise from the other Red Adair.
l'd never use explosives
to get the style l wanted.
This is hairdressing.
There are limits.
What was that like, knowing
you were a born hairdresser...
...growing up without school in the
working-class district in Glasgow?
Let's have a look around a bit more.
Do you not want me
to ask you about--?
We'll talk about it later.
l wanna cut it short, curls on top,
and dye it red.
Rarely do we do the ''Full Bluebell,''
but Senga's is a deserving case.
She hasn't been herself
since the accident in the bakery.
lt's going to look gorgeous.
You'll look fabulous.
There.
Crawford...
...you're a genius.
l know.
You can't dominate the Glasgow
regionals for five years...
...and then not get asked to L.A.
You know?
l mean, they're gonna come.
Welcome to my wee office, or as l
call it, my galleria del trofeo.
And here we are, the grand fromage:
Sean Connery.
Which one's Sean Connery?
ln the middle there.
lt's been said that my Sean Connery
is indistinguishable...
...from the real thing
with closed eyes, Mr. Goldfinger.
lt was a glorious day at Gleneagles,
apart from Sean's hair catastrophe.
Luckily, l was able to
step in and help out.
Alas, you know, discretion forbids.
Right. Which one's this? Who is this?
lt's Stig Ludwigssen...
...winner of the Platinum Scissors
for the last three years.
You can't go higher
in the hair hierarchy.
Stig Ludwigssen's salon is in L.A.,
where hair can make you or break you.
What about him being singled out...
...to compete against
the greatest hairdressers?
lt's absolutely wonderful.
There was a hint of genius
even when--
What channel is this for, mate?
-lt's a documentary for English tele--
-What channel is it for?
lt's a documentary for English
television. Stand over there, sir.
We're shooting in this direction,
and it's difficult--
l think you should get a sweater on.
This is my garden.
You've always bored me.
What was he like as a child?
Very, very intelligent.
l called up Mensa about him.
Mensa?
And they suggested l get him
a chess set.
What do you think happened
the very afternoon l brought it home?
l don't know. What?
He takes the little men...
...and dresses them up
in homemade hula skirts...
...and performed the bigger numbers
from South Pacific.
Bali Ha' your special island
Come to me, come to me
Let me ask you about Gareth.
He's a nice boy, isn't he?
Come here. Thank you.
-All the best.
-Thank you, Airdrie. Wave!
Well done, well done.
-Look, l got you in a sticky mess.
-l thought so.
We're all very proud.
l'm his biggest fan.
What? He's got an underwater camera.
He's so talented and sexy.
He's an excellent guy.
Yeah, isn't he, boys?
l'll tell you what,
l'd sleep with him.
-You know he's gay.
-No, he isn't.
lf they want him out in California,
it's probably for the best.
He'll be amongst his own kind
out there.
Shark-infested waters.
-Don't go to Hollywood.
-Shut your face.
I had a very settledlife in Scotland.
I had my cats, my mother
my friend Gareth.
And these people were the reason
that I was getting on that plane.
Bless them.
You know, this was something
l had to do...
...not for me, but for Scotland.
-That is lovely, Mum. Thanks.
-ls it the right size?
-Yankee Doodle Dandy.
-Shut up. Shut up.
With the stars and the stripes,
it's lovely.
Son, it's a wee bit wee on you.
l'll need to knit you another one.
Don't you dare. lt's fine.
lt's lovely. l love it.
Hey, listen.
-Take your Billy doll. Bring you luck.
-Thanks.
-Not that you need luck.
-Shut up.
l'm sorry.
As they say in Llandow:
''Ciao for now.''
-Come on.
-All right.
-Are you tired?
-Yes.
But an international sort of tired,
if you know what l mean.
I couldn't believe it. Seeing him
at the airport, it was like an omen.
Not The Omen, of course, but
equally as scary in a different way.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. lt's Stig!
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss.
Do you work for Stig?
We're busy.
Charming.
-Who was that?
-Stig Ludwigssen.
Cheerio! He's the one to beat.
-Hey, you guys want a ride?
-No, thanks. We'll get a taxi.
Forget them. They don't speak English.
They'll get you lost.
l got it! l got it, dude!
-That's my stretch.
-Your what?
My limo. Stretch.
Classy, you know?
-Get a taxi.
-Go and get a trolley. How much?
-Two hundred bucks.
-No way.
-Where you from?
-Scotland.
-Seventy-five bucks.
-Fifty.
All right.
Welcome, gentlemen.
Welcome to Los Angeles, baby.
lt's big, isn't it?
Look! ''Marina del Rey.''
l knew a drag queen once
called Marina del Rey.
She was from Wolverhampton.
She's a great dancer.
Fat arse, though.
What movie you guys making?
lt's a fly-on-the-wall documentary.
Want an idea for a movie?
l only do documentaries.
Five words:
Teenage Hasidic lizard
basketball mutiny.
You know what l mean?
lt's a slam-dunk, man.
Big UFO that comes down.
''You lose, you become our slave.''
They have Michael jordan.
3 a.m., my beeper goes off. l'm like,
''St. Eamonn here. Who needs what?''
Back in the '80s, l was in
a little rock 'n' roll outfit.
Missing my lady
On the road
lt's kind of a road song.
l stay at the Bel Age,
but this is good.
Hi, l'm Ronnie. Welcome to
the Century Plaza Hotel.
Here's my headshot.
Give me a call anytime.
There's an 81 8 beeper number
on the back. lt'll change, but....
lf you need a car, chick, schooner,
anything, give me a call.
All right.
l'm serious, man. Give me a call.
You never know.
We have you in a king-size suite...
...but your preferential group rate
entitles you to an upgrade.
Super-duper.
-Where is your accent from?
-l'm from Glasgow.
l love the Beatles.
l'm just gonna need
a credit card now, sir.
Thanks.
How much do you tip?
You take the tax and double it.
-What tax?
-just give him $5.
Oh, my God!
An upgrade!
lt's got electric curtains.
-Very nice.
-lt's fantastic!
Oh, my God!
Ronnie.
-That's for you.
-Thanks very much.
Look at that, Martin, it's fantastic!
lt's fantastic!
A four-poster bed.
l've always wanted one.
-You like this, don't you?
-l love it. You know what?
l was born to this.
No, Mum, it's the Clinton Suite.
No, President Clinton.
Why would a Los Angeles hotel name
a suite after B.B. Clinton of Rangers?
l'm here right now.
l'm wearing a blue shirt
and my tartan trousers...
...the ones that are tight.
l don't have to worry about who pays.
WHlF are paying for it.
No corkscrew, not a problem.
Hello, room service?
Could you send up Ronnie
with a corkscrew, please?
When the cat's away, the big,
Scottish hairdressing mouse will play.
Let's get that other one.
l think the other one's--
Spectacular, isn't it?
When you look out
at all those twinkling lights...
...and you realize that every one
of them has a story....
There are people out there
living, dying...
...laughing, making love...
...having their hair done....
lt's just profound.
All the trees are brown
All the trees are brown
And the sky is gray
The sky is gray
California
--alifornia dreaming
On such a winter's day
I'd be safe and--
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L.A.
ls the camera rolling?
Good night, Les.
Could we do the curtains again?
No, l'm going to sleep. That's it.
Cut, Seamus.
Is this how you prepare
for a competition?
l wouldn't sit out by the pool
in Scotland, but it's very similar.
l like to get myself calm
and focused and relaxed.
lt's not like being a violinist,
where you practice.
No, it's about calmness
and focus and serenity.
Mr. Mackenzie.
l am Dunstan Cactus,
manager of the hotel.
You fellows don't need me
on that thing. Hi, Mom.
lf there's anything in the hotel
not to your liking...
...you call me instantly.
We'll sit in my office and talk.
Any time of day or night.
-Great.
-Enjoy your stay.
Thank you very much.
Let's do it now. Always room
in my schedule for an honored guest.
What do you say? l insist.
-All right, sir.
-Okay, great.
Hang on, hang on.
Excuse me.
We've had many cameras
in the hotel before.
There's not enough light.
Camera cable is stuck
in the fucking door.
Hang on!
All right, sir. Come on in.
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.
Have you got your passport on you?
Sure, yeah.
l knew it. Because the accent--
Scottish-British passport.
l always wondered:
''Scotland,'' ''England,'' ''lreland''
and then just ''Wales.''
l love that. just one
nice, short country there too.
lt bespeaks a people
with a sense of balance.
And Scotland is the most
beautiful country in the world.
-You've been there?
-No.
But over the years,
friends have sent me post cards...
...and one builds up a picture
in the mind's eye.
And it intensifies
to the point where, frankly...
...l actually consider myself
to be Scottish...
...though, of course, by mail.
-ls there something wrong?
-Let's have a drink.
l'm afraid l don't have much
to offer you except water...
...but l have a nice collection
of that.
Aqua java, Avalon, Evian,
Clearly Canadian, Sparkletts...
...Eternal Spring--
l don't know whether
to drink it or put it on my skin.
Very good. Eternal Spring it is.
And one for your friend.
-Thanks.
-Don't be afraid of it.
Well, l love water.
l used to love booze.
l used to be a bit of
a Moonshine Marty, l'm afraid.
But thanks to the grace
of my higher power...
...whom l call my Lord and Savior,
jesus Christ...
...l haven't had a drink
in five days.
l am an alcoholic.
l'm not afraid to say that
to them, by the way.
l thought it was because my uncle
put his finger in my anus...
...when l was a kid, but that's
all water under the bridge.
All right, to business.
We have a teeny problem,
and l think we can clear it up.
You've maxed out your credit card.
We need an imprint of--
There's a misunderstanding.
Don't be embarrassed.
lt happens all the time.
We have a number of charges,
and we have to keep current.
lt's for the meals, the massage,
the maxi bar, in-room movies.
Men of San Francisco. Three times.
-l've seen that.
-l don't pay for the room.
l'm here as a competitor in
the Platinum Scissors Competition.
l don't think the World Hairdressing
lnternational Federation...
...would have one of their competitors
pay for their own hotel suite.
Nevertheless...
...l have to ask you to live up
to your fiscal responsibilities.
And until that happens...
...l'm going to have to
hold on to this.
Here at the Century Plaza,
we never like to alarm our guests.
We'll do it, but we don't like it.
Monique, I have a Mr. Mackenzie
here to see you.
Okay, tell him to wait.
l think this is her now.
The hotel doesn't have any record
as regards payment.
They don't know that WHlF are
picking up the tab for competitors.
Well, we are picking up the tab.
But you're not one of the competitors.
Who are you?
Me, l'm Crawford.
l'm Crawford Mackenzie.
You wrote to me personally inviting me
to be part of the hair-off.
l did write this.
This is a form letter, however.
Our computer picks 1 00 people at random
off our associate membership list...
...and we invite them to come to L.A.
to the hair-off...
...but to be part of the audience
on the big night.
So this is just....
lf you see here at the bottom, it says
we've reserved you a hotel booking.
Everyone, the whole lucky 1 00,
gets it.
lt's at the preferential
group rate, so....
Monique, l'm from Scotland.
Great.
ln Scotland, when one invites you to
a hair competition to participate...
...it means you'll be participating
in that hair competition...
...and not sitting in the back row
with 99 lucky new friends...
...chewing on a fucking Raisinette.
Sorry, this has been
a dreadful misunderstanding.
No, it's fine, really.
Honestly, it's okay.
l've come 7000 miles to be part of
a hair competition l'm not even in.
lt's fine. lt's not a problem.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Look at this. Ten dollars
for a tin of cherry cola.
Where does it say you have to pay
for these things?
Right there, sir.
Where else on the bill does it say
you have to pay for it?
Watch it, you punk.
Killer ride, you fat bagel!
One of yours?
-Sorry.
-Hi, baby. How you doing?
Hey, Mom!
That woman's bald.
Yes.
You got a great deal, man.
-How much?
-l got a double-occupancy thing.
It was wise moving out
of the last hotel.
It was way too flash.
Too much opulence is bad
for my instrument.
You don't feel this is a comedown?
No, not at all.
l actually like it here. l think it's
a lot more cutesy, you know, charming.
l mean, look at that. lt's sweet,
isn't it? That rococo kind of design.
That's the difference between
Britain and America.
Even in the demi-luxe category here,
they make the effort.
Mind you, you're still not
in the competition.
Of course l'm in the competition.
There's been a tiny bureaucratic error.
lt'll all be fine tomorrow morning.
jesus Christ!
This is dangerous.
lt smells good.
Maybe there's air freshener in it.
Kind of like a potpourri inside
to make the room smell nice.
l'll open a window.
Can you do something about this?
Do you like spicy food?
-This isn't that spicy.
-Well, it is to me.
lf you want hot food,
l'll take you to Mexico.
That'd be great. lf we've
got time, we should do that.
Turn over.
What did you do this morning?
l went to Koreatown and l saw Chokko,
Eamonn the limo driver's friend.
He seemed like a nice guy.
Although a horrible neighborhood,
l was glad to get out.
Seemed a bit expensive
just to rent a car.
Anyway, we're mobile.
Do you want a drink?
l don't think you were to eat that.
They're garnish.
-Nice ride.
-Thank you.
Eamonn really pulled the cat
out of the box with this one.
l'd love to see their faces
on Sauchiehall Street.
-Quite big, isn't it?
-lt's a Doris Day-mobile.
They drink petrol by the gallon.
So do half my friends in Glasgow.
-So where are we going?
-Monique's.
Do you think that's a good idea?
She's the organizer.
lt's partly my fault.
l let my ego get in the way.
We'll let bygones be bygones.
Anyway, she'll change her mind
when she sees my portfolio.
lt's amazing.
You know, really, all of it.
Thank you very much.
lt's tremendous. l mean, l....
l understand now why you thought
you may have been--
There's no need. lt was my fault.
l lost my temper. l'm sorry.
l'll tell you what l'm gonna do.
l'm gonna put you in the best seat
in the house.
Right here, between Daniel Day-Lewis...
...and Carrot Top.
Thank you very much, Monique,
but l came to compete.
Right.
Crawford, with all due respect...
...these stylists are
international stars.
Three stylists compete every year.
The top hairdressers in Beverly Hills
are not invited.
So l do not know how else
l can explain that.
l'm coming.
l'm as good or better
than any of them!
You really don't understand, do you?
-lt doesn't matter how good you are?
-lt matters, but we don't know you.
Then it could take years
before you were selected.
-l want to enter anyway.
-You have to be invited.
-Then invite me.
-l don't know who you are!
l'm Crawford Mackenzie.
Even if l could just let you in,
you're not even qualified to compete.
You're not even a member of the guild,
of HAG.
All of the stylists
are members of the guild.
lt's a competition requirement, okay?
Then l'll join.
l'm sorry.
Please.
Hairdressers of America Guild.
Right. l need one day's work
in a salon to get my HAG union card.
lf l can't get work here, l might as
well hang up my crimping tongs...
...and hobble off into the sunset.
l'd like to speak to Stig, please.
Do you have an appointment?
Would you like to make one?
l can fit you in Tuesday at 2.
You misunderstand. l'm a stylist.
l'd like to speak to him personally.
l'm sorry. You can't even speak to me
without an appointment.
Don't be ridiculous.
What? You're ignoring me now
because l don't have an appointment?
Kimberly, let him in.
-Welcome to Valhenna.
-Thank you.
-What an honor to finally meet you.
-l'm sure it is.
-l can't believe it.
-Believe it. l'm right here.
-l've been a huge fan of yours--
-Can we get on with the questions?
l've used your salmon
finishing rinse on my mother...
...and l've noticed, pre-drying,
a slight air of burnt toast.
-ls that normal, or am l misapplying?
-Excuse me.
You. Okay, wait. Come here.
My name's Martin Samuels.
l'm making a TV--
lt's a film documentary
about Crawford Mackenzie.
Crawford Mackenzie?
Who is Crawford Mackenzie?
l'm Crawford Mackenzie.
You?
l'm a fellow stylist...
...and l'm here representing Scotland
in the Platinum Scissors Competition.
l wanted to have a word with you.
l've run into a technical snag.
What happened?
l don't have a HAG card.
-l need one for the competition.
-Of course.
So l need a day's work in a salon...
...just to smooth it over.
You know what? l would really love to
help you, but l'm not going to.
Lars. Thank you. Goodbye.
Please.
l'm going.
Thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Brat.
lt's the hairdresser's way.
He's anointed me, Martin.
He said, ''Crawford Mackenzie,
you can do it on your own.''
-Any luck?
-l couldn't work there.
There was a terrible smell.
l don't know what it was.
l think they were making a curry out
of someone's underpants in the back.
It was foul.
Fine, l'll go. Thank you very much.
No joy?
-Racists.
-Racists?
He said, ''We didn't like Braveheart,
we don't like whiskey...
...we don't like your accent,
so please get out.''
l don't know about you,
but that sounds like racism.
Fair enough.
America, land of the free.
HAG? Don't talk to me
about HAG, those loser bastards.
They've forgotten what it's about.
Look at this.
-A simple step cut with razor edging.
-Exactly.
Think l could do anything like this
in a salon in Beverly Hills? No way.
How did you get into HAG
in the first place?
How do you think?
-Celeb endorsements?
-Exactly. Celebrity endorsements.
Why not phone
your friend Sean Connery?
You don't just phone Sean Connery.
His telephone number changes
every four days for security reasons.
l got in touch with People magazine.
They didn't have his number,
but they did the next best thing.
They put me in touch
with his publicist.
You're always looking to dig the dirt,
Martin. lt's a problem with you.
l'd like to speak
to Candy Harper, please.
-You have an appointment?
-No, but l'm Crawford Mackenzie.
l'm a friend of Sean Connery's.
You know Sean Connery?
He's a client here,
but l've never met him.
He was so rad in Zardoz.
Candy, there's a Crawford Mackenzie
here to see you.
-ls he on the list?
-No, but he's Sean Connery's friend.
-Does he have an appointment?
-No.
Well?
l'm sorry, Candy can't see you without
an appointment. Could you make one?
l'm afraid not.
l don't mean to go above your head...
...but this is a Scottish matter.
You think this brown shows really bad?
David Hasselhoff, l'm Crawford
Mackenzie. You're a god in Scotland.
Thank you.
This is not a scheduled interview.
Who are you?
You're from the airport.
You're Candy Harper?
-Who are you?
-l'm Martin Samuels.
l'm making a documentary
for British TV. lt's a nice surprise.
On a personal note, my niece just got
her lifesaving certificate.
Terrific. Let me wish her the best.
When you're on the beach,
the sun, sea and sand...
...must play havoc with your hair.
What kind of products do you use?
Candy, l gotta be going.
The German tour, see you then.
Thank you very much,
and hello to all my fans in Scotland.
What do you want?
l'm sorry to barge in on you,
but l'm a friend of Sean Connery's.
Could you put me in touch?
Mr. Connery is teeing off right now.
He'd be annoyed if he knew l'd been
here and his representatives hadn't--
l'm sure he'll fire me.
Give Gretle your number.
We'll get him in touch with you.
Look, it says here, and l quote:
''Sean Connery sees himself as
an ambassador for Scots all over.''
l'm Scottish, l'm all over,
and l demand to see the ambassador.
-Sorry.
-Fine, l'll go.
But let me just say one thing:
Your behavior is indicative
of the petty-minded stuff...
...Sean has been fighting against
his whole life.
Pantene Pro-V with a generic brand
alkali conditioner...
...using a nonsoluble
finishing rinse.
Held in place
with a flammable stiffener.
Are you mad?
How did you know?
A hair professional knows.
Let me just say one thing:
lf this level of abuse continues,
when you have your hair done...
...you won't necessarily
have to be there.
l'd help you,
but given the situation....
l'm not giving you his number.
Three words:
Telly and...
...Savalas.
The problem with the products you've
been using is, they're alcohol-based.
What's the difference?
ln layman's terms, it means
your hair is drunk.
You've got thousands of wee alcoholics
growing out of your head.
Your hair is powerless.
lt has to go into rehab.
First things first.
Crockett's Kiwi Volumizing
Reconstructor. lt's CPR for hair.
-Stig hasn't told you about it?
-He doesn't do my hair.
That's obvious.
l meant as a friend.
l only met him the other day.
He was out doing a client's hair
at the airport. Why are you here?
l'm representing Scotland
in the Platinum Scissors.
Really? Monique didn't tell me
there was a Scottish competitor.
So you don't really know Sean.
l do. l got him out of a jam once.
He owes me a favor.
What kind of a jam?
Loose lips sink ships. Stay still.
l got a bit on my finger.
Turn your head.
lt's not leaking?
lt's not leaking yet.
Can you keep your head in one place?
That's what they all say.
l was thinking of cutting it
really short.
How long has it been?
What?
ln my experience, women cut their hair
really short for one of two reasons:
Either they've gone through
a nasty breakup with a man...
...or they're heavily involved
in the world of ladies' golf.
l'm looking at you,
and l'm not seeing much of a putter.
Ladies andgentlemen...
...may l present your employer...
...Miss Candice Margaret Hilda Harper.
That's great!
lt's fabulous! l just love it!
Hello, Mr. Connery,
it's Crawford Mackenzie.
I was a fan of yours
long before we met.
l never got a chance to
compliment you...
...on the subaquatic segments
of Never Say Never Again.
What was it like working with
Barbara Carrera?
That sounds fine, honey.
Now just dial the number.
Hello, 007? lt's the hair master.
Are you concerned that Sean
might not remember you?
Do you think l can have some privacy,
please, Martin?
Come on. just call him, man.
Come on!
All right.
Why don't you just go back?
Martin, why don't you just go back?
Bugger off!
Go to the lap-dancing bar
you were in last night.
Did you have your camera running then?
Did you?
Sean, it's Crawford.
Sean, it's Crawford....
Hi, Sean, it's Crawford Mackenzie.
You probably don't remember me...
...but l steam-cleaned
your hairpiece at Gleneagles...
...when it blew off at the fourth
green during the Benny Hill Pro-Am.
Happy days.
l was wondering if you could write
a letter to HAG...
...telling them what a great hair--
Thank you very much.
Have you got the Hollywood sign in?
Turn over.
Right, so it's just
jogging and talking.
Sean was busy. He's a busy man.
But he did suggest maybe l'd like
to schmooze Candy a little more.
''Schmooze'' is a Yiddish word.
lt means, ''Talking business
and eating a snack at the same time.''
l think Lentl says it to one of his
henchmen in Fiddler on a Hot Tin Roof.
Anyway, the point being, l've arranged
to have my first power lunch.
Great. That's really good.
Did you get the Hollywood sign in?
Thanks for having lunch.
That's all right. l always have lunch.
Sometimes several times a day.
l wanted to talk to you--
Excuse me. l'm very excited
to tell you about our specials today.
As an appetizer, we have the pita
knapsack of Haitian tribal crudités.
As an entrée, we have
poached Numidian hen...
...that's pan-seared in its own juices
and flash-fried...
...before encased
in its own phyllo kingdom...
...and surrounded by a moat
of luminous chive custard.
-lt's worth the 1 5-minute wait.
-We'll have two Caesar salads.
Excellent choice.
-The reason l wanted--
-Before you say a word...
...l have got to tell you something.
You really cheered me up
the other day.
You're the first person who could be
a friend and not be after something.
jerry and l are going to
give it another try.
l really think it has a lot to do with
this makeover you gave me.
l feel attractive again.
lt's not just about the hair.
lt's about the healing.
You are so right.
jerry and l will spend the weekend
in Santa Barbara...
...at a Psychic Friends
tennis retreat.
Lovely. What's that?
A tennis retreat, Psychic Friends
Weekend in Santa Barbara...
...that we're going to
over the weekend.
Great.
-Hey, johnny.
-Hey, fruit cup.
Look at you.
My God, you look sensational.
You're glowing!
Who is laying you?
You can tell me.
What is it? Hercules?
l want to thank you again for coming
to the airport to do Harrison's hair.
He was thrilled.
Of course he was.
Scottish. From my salon, right?
Lovely to see you again.
That's the guy l told you--
He'll give you a run for your money
in the Platinum Scissors.
He can't even get a job sweeping the
floor in my salon for a HAG card.
Listen. Next month it's Loser's Day.
Come back. l piss on your head.
''Piss on your head.''
He's such an asshole.
Wait, wait, wait. Breathe.
You can't get into the Platinum
Scissors without a HAG card.
Why didn't you just tell me?
l was, then you said all that
nice stuff about being your friend.
You are my friend.
l can get you the card.
lt's my town, remember?
Come by my office
by the end of the day.
l'll get you a job
that'll make you HAG-eligible.
Hold on! Wait a minute!
Excuse me, officer. This is my car.
What are you doing?
You must be Ming Tai-Pei.
Strange, you don't look like a 78-
year-old Asian chef from Koreatown.
Don't know what you mean. lt's
my car. l rented it this morning.
-He did.
-Shut it.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
This car is a stolen vehicle,
and you're under arrest, ''Ming.''
Where were you?
l posted bail, but they wouldn't
let you out until this morning.
-Creep.
-Where's the car?
They wouldn't give me the bloody car!
They wouldn't make any arrests
because of insufficient evidence!
l'm lucky l wasn't deported!
That's it. l'm gonna go to Koreatown
and sort out this Chokko character.
Koreatown? l'm not sure that's--
That is very dangerous.
lt's Crawford Mackenzie. l'd like to
speak to you about the car.
Don't hang around here!
lt wasn't your car to rent!
l don't think this is
a very good idea.
l think we should probably leave now.
Oh, God.
l've wet my trousers.
You've come all this way...
...and now you're giving up
the chance of a lifetime.
-Yes.
-Right.
There are many things
l'm willing to do for my art...
...but being attacked by a team
of Korean marksmen is not one of them.
Man...
...l am so sorry.
l heard what happened with the car.
l told that dude Chokko:
''l'm never doing business
with you again.''
l'm so happy, Eamonn.
l am so happy.
l'm happy to know that had l died,
had l been shot...
...l wouldn't have died in vain,
as your business would be in order.
-l'm happy you're all right, bro.
-l am not your brother.
Where the hell have you been?
Didn't you get my messages?
l was being raped in prison.
You shouldn't be having fun
when there's work to do.
l don't care.
l got you a job. A runway show.
You've gotta be there in an hour.
-Candy, l'm going home.
-Yeah, he is.
This is a HAG job. You do this,
you're in the competition.
-Come on.
-But my car was impounded.
-l'll drive.
-Damn right, you big toe-rag.
Welcome to the Kingdom of Joy.
Candy Harper for Betty Fuego.
Did you pack your own bags today?
Bringing in any alcohol, knives, guns,
drugs, heroin, any other opiates?
Excuse me. Hi.
Wearing gang colors back here?
l'm Candy Harper.
This is Crawford Mackenzie.
We're here for Betty Fuego.
That's way too many names.
Harper. Candy Harper.
All right. You got
three walkon passes. Right.
You're gonna have to back this rig
on up to lot Z and walk it on in.
lf we could just take
Back it up! Let's go.
Candy, l am so sorry about
the mixup at the gate.
This is my home away from home.
That's great. Where are my models?
They like to be called ''actors.''
lt's a local convention.
This is the dressing room! Hi, guys!
Candy said you'd be happy to do this.
That you wanted your HAG card.
This is ridiculous.
l'm a hairdresser, l'm not a vet.
Then l'll just have to tell the actors
that the show is canceled!
Let go of your ego.
Just go out there and do your job.
l do hair, l don't do plumage.
l'm disappointed in you.
You know how many strings l pulled
to make this happen?
They're four mental Method actors
in animal costumes.
Listen to me, it cost me 300 bucks
to get rid of the regular stylist.
Did it?
Yes.
Listen. Just a note
from last performance.
ln the foraging part, let's see more
detail on what food you're looking for.
Reach inside your actor's toolbox.
l'm Eamonn. l'm Crawford's driver.
Go out there and kick some butt.
stop hopping!
l'm looking for my carrots.
lt's a damn kids' show!
An agent's coming.
she's got a new agency
in Palm springs.
l'm trying to get into
the Extras Guild. lt's paid.
Once l'm finished,
it'll look like Elvis Presley.
A woodland creature Elvis Presley...
...but it'll be Elvis Presley
nonetheless.
stop with the hopping!
l'm working. l'm working,
all right? l'm a bunny.
Animals! A little peace
in the kingdom, please.
He's hopping around
Bear, come on. Hibernate!
l know we only had a short time
to pull this together...
...but we've done a bloody good job.
No, you've done a bloody good job.
Thank you. Come here.
Everyone, rub the back of the animal
next to you. Come on. There you are.
God...
...grant me the serenity to accept
the things l cannot change....
Hey, kids, remember
There's a good touch and a bad touch
Don't be chicken
To say no to drugs
A hip and a hop
Oh, yeah
But I ain't no gangsta
That was fantastic. lt was fabulous.
The best show ever.
Finalmente, Crawford Mackenzie,
member, HAG.
You're still not in the competition.
He will be.
Where's a good place to go dancing?
Depends what you want.
Ever been to Club spartacus?
l've been by it.
You ought to take him there.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
You look amazing.
lt's just a little something
l threw together.
lt's a sort of
Braveheart meets Liberace...
...or si tu préférais...
...''Bravace.''
l love it so much here.
My God, look at that!
There's nothing like this in scotland.
l mean, just nothing like it.
The whole freedom of the place
just makes me feel so....
I'm Crawford Mackenzie.
I'm a hairdresser.
I'm a fellow stylist.
You are now licensed to style...
...in the state of California.
Mr. Mackenzie, congratulations.
The great thing about
a HAG card is...
...it can get you into
any hair event in the world...
...whether it's Vidal sassoon's
Quick Rinse Rodeo...
...or stig Ludwigssen talking
about modern hair products.
Anyway, l couldn't wait to show
Monique Geingold my HAG card.
Modern hair products are homogenized.
They're pasteurized, fried.
They're shaked, baked...
...they're not real.
But at Valhenna, we are already
in the 21 st century.
We're going back to nature.
We said to nature, ''Hello, nature.
We sorry about the ozone layer...
...but could we please borrow
a few fish to make our ladies...
...beautiful again?'' You see?
lt's a fluke. lt used to swim
like this, now it swims like this.
We have it reduced here into a paste.
lt's a special dandelion
and a kind of a juju muck paste.
We took this fish
and put it into a bottle.
Then we gently massage it
into the scalp.
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
And then l did a documentary about...
...prawn fishing in the Philippines.
lt's staggering, their level
of poverty. l'd love you to see it.
so was it good for you?
Brilliant. Always.
l want you to behave.
l can't. l never had parents.
l'm at work.
Congratulations.
That's great.
so...?
so?
so what?
so now he can be in the hairoff.
l can't let you in just because
you got your HAG card.
You said l could be in it
if l got my HAG card.
No, l did not. Darling, it's much
more than a HAG thing. l'm sorry.
Listen, l respect you
as an artist, okay? l do.
And l love the BTV. Okay?
l love Masterpiece Theatre.
Only you're not getting into
my competition.
That's not fair. You lied!
Excuse me.
l will not be bullied. All right?
scottish, what
still making a film about a man
who can't find a job?
l give you a job.
Kiss my ass.
Don't be such a prick!
Listen, Candy.
Give him a break.
Everyone admires your little charity
work. But why waste your time?
Aren't you carrying around enough
excess baggage as it is?
Forget about her.
she's just a Beverly Hills tart held
together by hair spray and pantyhose.
This isn't about Monique.
lt's about Jerry.
something happened at
the Psychic Friends tennis retreat?
l caught him with another woman.
l should've seen it coming.
He was all over her
at the Premonition Brunch...
...which is held the night before.
Poor thing.
Why is it we always love the men
who cause us the most pain?
l know.
One night in Glasgow, l was mistaken
for a Belgian soccer fan...
...by four sailors from lnverness
who beat me senseless.
l still keep in touch
with one of them.
Donald is the name.
He's a lovely man.
There's two girls over there kissing.
so do you feel your time here
has been completely wasted?
You know what, Martin?
You talk too much.
in Los Angeles
for tomorrow night's...
...International Platinum
Scissors Competition.
Billionaire industrialist
Warren Crockett is also in town.
One of his companies sponsors
the competition...
...but it seems unlikely
that the enigmatic tycoon...
...will be watching tomorrow.
I don't mindif a bunch of soft boys
get together andsnip a little hair...
...so long as it sells a few crates
of salonjuice for me.
If I know Senator Crockett,
he'll be on his private golf course.
He spent, what, $20 million?
You're close. 25 million.
But when your golfing pals are
Tiger Woods and Sean Connery...
...you spare no expense.
Favored for the third year...
...is worldchampion stylist,
Stig Ludwigssen.
I feel great, really.
I'm young, I'm fit...
...I'm tingly, sexy, cool.
You guys are out of here.
Calm down.
sorry, he's upset. Jetlag thing.
seamus can't find his trousers.
l've got my passport in them.
Here, do you know where the...?
Do you know where the coffee is?
Jesus Christ.
sorry.
Get out. Out.
Good morning, tiger.
stop that. Don't call me that.
stop that. l'm gay. l'm gay.
You could've fooled me last night.
The things you did to me.
Where'd you learn that stuff?
You're a total animal.
Why did you keep calling me ''Gareth''?
l did not.
What is this?
lt's a rainmaker.
lt sounds like a toilet flushing.
Well, you don't have to worry.
You couldn't have done anything
even if you wanted to.
Of course, he's doing wonders
for my selfesteem.
sorry, Candy.
l adore you. l really do.
lt's just that...
...l prefer my women with a penis.
l made such a fool of myself.
Eat your breakfast.
Coming over here, trying to be part of
a competition l'm not even invited to.
lt's like coming to the Olympic games
in shorts, saying, ''Where's my javelin?''
lt doesn't happen.
l'm glad you're here.
l'm just sorry you're such a pussy.
Think you're the first person
to get knocked around by Tinseltown?
You think this crap doesn't happen to
every person that gets off the bus?
Well, let me tell you
something, buddy.
You got big dreams?
You want fame? Well, fame costs.
And right here's where you
start paying. ln sweat.
Are you all right?
You're a great hairdresser, right?
l don't even know anymore.
Are you a great hairdresser?
Yes or no? ls he a great hairdresser?
Yes, he is.
Are you a great hairdresser?
Yes, l am.
Then you can win this hairoff.
l can't even get into this hairoff.
lf you could get in, you could win.
Finish your Cocoa Puffs.
Candy was wonderful.
She was wellconnectedin Hollywood...
...but I never dreamedshe'dget
comedy heavyweight Drew Carey...
...to come to lunch
at the flick of a hat.
You're going right to features.
Watch out, Denzel.
Excuse me. someone would like
a word with you.
There's only a few things l love.
l love puppies at Christmas.
l love the sound the water makes...
...when it hits the pillars
under the Bridge of sighs.
l love leather underwear.
But most of all, Monique...
...l love what that man does
with hair.
Don't ever make me tell you
that again.
Drew Carey is not Jewish...
...but nevertheless, he is an expert
in the art of schmoozing.
In no time at all, he had Monique
eating out of his hand...
...hook, line andsinker.
The upshot was that we were summoned
to a powwow at Monique's office.
I wore my blue sweater.
As you both know...
...Platinum scissors has been hosted
by Warren Crockett for 25 years...
...and due to the exceptional nature
of this situation...
...l called the senator at home
this morning.
You are a remarkable artist.
That's without a doubt.
The impression you've made on this town
in such a short time is unparalleled.
Thank you.
Despite your phenomenal effort,
the senator decided...
...not to include another stylist
in the competition.
l'm sorry.
Monique, l think
Candy, l'm sorry.
Thank you for your time.
Like a mint?
The hardest part about all of this
was that it really wasn't about me.
It was about the people back home.
Mr. Patel, Frank the postman...
...Margaret, Gareth, Mother.
The ones who'd never won anything...
...let alone an international
hairdressing prize.
This was for the little people.
And we all know what happens
to the little people, don't we?
They get trodden on by the big people.
Clumsy, big people with big feet...
...crushing the little people
in the pavement of life.
Dreams squashedlike insects
on the giant shoes of fate.
It'sjust sad.
This is sean Connery.
l'd like to speak
to senator Crockett, please.
Hello, Warren. How are you?
lt's sean.
Pull it!
Great shot!
Great place. Beautiful!
Yeah? Pull it!
You got it again!
Come on up!
l've known sean Connery for 25 years...
...and yours is by far
the worst impersonation...
...l've ever heard.
You tried to deceive me.
And l find that very...
...charming.
What the hell do you want?
l need a favor.
Why should l do you a favor?
l've studied you. You started
with nothing. Now you rule the world.
Not Belgium.
lt couldn't have been easy
being in a shanghai orphanage.
1 6 kids to a hammock.
What's your point?
lt's not like your empire
sprung out of the ground.
You started with
a drycleaning store in Manila.
When you were 25, you were
the most successful man in Asia.
The garment industry, rubber,
tin mining, cosmetics.
You think l owe the universe a favor,
and you want to call it in.
son...
...you've got balls of dynamite.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
sure.
Take care, kid.
Cheerio!
Give 'em hell, Crawford!
The stars are out in force tonight for
L.A.'s annual hair extravaganza.
Giuseppe Franco, how are you?
Veronica, how are you?
Jose, how are you tonight?
stig Ludwigssen.
A gorgeous kiss of talent.
He's got balls.
l think stig will.
Everyone who is anyone is here...
...to watch top stylists
compete for the ultimate prize:
The Platinum scissors.
This is the night
we've been working towards.
How do you feel?
Great, like William Wallace...
...must have felt before
the battle of stirling Bridge...
...but my hair's not
as puffy or unkempt.
We are so thrilled and honored
that you could make it.
l tried so hard to get you in.
l'm glad it came together in the end.
How is the senator?
He's great. He's great.
Hi, fruit cup. How are you?
Well, so, scottish.
Finally made it, huh?
Always knew you would. Right?
Didn't l always say that?
You have ambition.
You got determination.
You remind me of me.
That's true.
l hope not too much.
''l hope not too much,'' right?
Congratulations, Crawford,
and good luck. Really.
Thank you very much.
You bet.
And good luck to you.
Hey, listen.
Why did you say good luck to him?
l was just being polite.
l didn't mean it.
Wait, Johnny.
ls this poosnacker any good?
Obviously, he must be pretty good
if he's here, right?
Anything you need,
l'll be right outside.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, let's get a drink.
l'll be with you in a minute.
Are you saying that he is
better than me?
Come on, stig. No one's
better than you. Relax.
l'm just saying there must be rules.
Why did Crockett let him in
in the first place?
l guess he's probably
Crockett's bumchum.
l'm pretty sure that Crockett's
not gay, all right?
step over here a second.
l wanna tell you something.
What?
Don't you fuck with me!
Don't fuck with me!
Don't you ever fuck with me!
Good luck, stig.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
l'm your host, Tony Bolero.
How are you? Thank you so much.
Let's start.
Let's find out what all
the fuss is about.
And here it is, the priceless
Platinum scissors.
He's not in here!
sorry.
l'm having a panic attack.
Let's talk about this.
Open the door.
l want to go home.
You can't go home, man!
Their origin shrouded in mystery.
All that's known is that they were
originally handsmelted...
...for Czar Nicholas ll of Russia
by Carl Fabergé himself.
Just open the door, honey.
Let me in.
l think l may be having a stroke.
Did you feel that?
Yes.
Then it's not a stroke.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
Nicki, you'll be with Crawford.
Kimora, you'll be with Dick.
Dave and Contrelle, as always.
Kylie, thanks for being with
stig again. l know how busy you are.
ln 1 941 , top Nazi Adolf Hitler...
...almost got his fascist fingers
on these scissors...
...but the brave
French Resistance fighters...
...intercepted these very scissors
on their way to Berchtesgaden.
lt gives me chills to stand so near...
...the magnificent Platinum scissors.
Gentlemen...
...the running order is as follows:
Crawford, you'll be first.
Dick, you're second, then Dave,
and the champion, stig, is last.
Gentlemen...
...to your tongs.
And as the excitement grows,
let's meet the judges.
First, the confessed bad boy of hair
himself, the one, the only...
...Giuseppe Franco,
ladies and gentlemen.
Celtic salon impresario...
...from Merthyr Tydfil
in south Wales, Titch Jones.
The king of all products,
John Paul Mitchell...
...and the lovely Elois Dejoria.
l'm not sweating now.
When l start sweating, you'll know it.
Now.
Now! Now!
We have one hour to go.
For my friends south of the border,
60 minutos to go.
What is going on?
Oh, God.
someone put some red dye
in all his products.
His mousse, his serums,
his volumizers.
What does it matter? lt's over now.
That's it. We're screwed.
l'm sorry.
We'll get them next year, man.
What did you say?
There's always next year.
No, there's not always next year.
Candy, go get me a pretty girl.
You don't have time.
l'll get you time.
Good. Thank you.
Give me that material from the couch.
Candy, a pretty girl, please!
Listen, l got a lot of volumizers.
You're welcome to them, mate.
Thanks, Dave. l'll come through.
l know you've been waiting,
and we are going to have a competition.
There's been a slight mishap backstage.
We're changing the order
of our competitors.
Our newcomer, Crawford Mackenzie
from scotland, will be going last.
But l assure you the competition
will be stiff, so enjoy yourselves.
Do what l do: Drink more.
Thank you.
Monique, stig has to go last.
He's the champion.
You can't put this scottish
freak show on after him.
Veronica.
How you doing?
My God. Hello!
l always wanted to be in this.
You're not even fam l'm sorry.
He's gonna walk.
And then you are gonna be screwed.
lf stig walks,
he's disqualified, all right?
He's this close to being disqualified
already, and you know why.
Come on, Monique.
stig had nothing to do with that.
Blow me.
l have to get to know your head.
We've got rubber cement.
lt's not gonna hurt your head.
You'll get used to it.
l have to calm down a little.
And now the moment you've all
been waiting for: The main event.
One stylist...
...one model, one hairdo...
...one shot at the big prize.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
our first contestant...
...Mr. Dick Miyake.
Dick is saying:
''The transition from monk to
hairdresser was a painful one for me.''
Give me some of that.
Put your fingers here.
We're bringing you up.
''My ancestors guide my hands...
...as l create my hair sculptures.''
And now, first off, a style
created especially...
...for this competition
by Dick Miyake.
And he simply calls it,
''House of the Rising sun.''
l don't want that.
Candy, l'm sorry.
You put cheese in my hair?
lt's gonna work.
You ruined my hair.
That's looking great!
Think positive.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dick Miyake...
...Kimora and the
''House of the Rising sun.''
All right. Let's check
these scores: 9.7, 9.7...
...John Paul Mitchell, 9.8...
...and 9.7, 9.8, 9.7.
Great scores for Dick Miyake!
lf this is the beginning,
imagine what is to come.
But don't imagine long,
here comes our British invader...
...Dave London.
And here's Dave in repose
at his favorite English pub.
My career took off here.
I come in here one day,
and there having a dump...
...was Her Royal Highness
Lady Bubbles Banks Fountain.
I gives her a cut. She shows
her friends. They loves it.
Next thing you know, I'm a
hairdressing sensation...
...which is amazing really,
because I only came in for a shit.
Here we go.
Dave London and his magical creation:
''Wembley Wonderland.''
This will be the one.
Do you love me?
l absolutely adore you!
Over there, on the shelf.
We are gonna win.
l don't wanna breathe.
Dave London, as the French called him,
''The lnfant Terrible.''
Let's look at our scores:
9.9, 9.9, 9.9...
...9.9, 9.9, 9.9!
Now, the moment that
you've been waiting for.
You can almost style the tension
in this room with a comb.
lt is my great pleasure to present a
close, personal friend of mine...
...and the freeform
hairstyling champion...
...stig Ludwigssen!
Did you use the cheese?
lt's not in there.
something's hardening.
That's just me. l'm excited.
Because I love people,
andpeople love me.
Because I love life,
and I love to live.
Andsometimes otherpeople
say to me...
...not the same people,
different people say to me:
"Stig, you are too kind to people.
You really are too nice to people. "
I say to them, "If you can't
be nice to people...
...get the hell out of my salon. "
From Trondheim, Norway,
stig Ludwigssen...
...with New Zealand's own Kylie Bax...
...and his creation, ''Odin's Longboat.''
Can l hold that?
Hold on.
Don't get your knickers in a twist.
Who's got a soldering iron?
Don't move!
Blow dryer?
That's it! We're done.
stig Ludwigssen, ladies and gentlemen.
Reigning world champion!
Unbelievable.
Let's look at the scores:
1 0, 1 0, 1 0!
All l can say is,
it's what l expected.
Maybe someday, never know.
You should've won.
Really?
You never know.
Our scottish competitor,
Crawford Mackenzie, was a late entry...
...so we couldn't make a film,
but l think this will be exciting.
With his model, Veronica Webb...
...Crawford Mackenzie's...
...''Flower of scotland.''
Oh, my!
This is going to be difficult indeed.
Judges, you must make
your decisions now.
As we look at the scoreboard....
Señora, we must ask for your vote.
1 1 , John Paul Mitchell!

Ladies and gentlemen...
...we have a new hairdressing
champion of the world:
Crawford Mackenzie!
l knew it. l knew it all along.
l'm so proud.
Thank you.
You hate this, don't you?
All l want to say
is this to you, okay?
We have hair competition, or is it
a toy show? That's the thing.
l gotta go now. Turn that off.
I felt sorry for Stig Ludwigssen.
To go from top Norwegian tojust
another Scandinavian hairdresser...
...must be a pretty
tough nut to swallow.
Looking back now, I feel I've grown
both spiritually...
...and as a hairdresser.
Was it hard to leave California?
No. It'sjust like Scotland
with palm trees...
...and better dental care.
I wanted to go home.
I wanted to see my friends.
And you know what?
I was dying for a curry.
surprise!
Welcome back, Mr. Mackenzie.
Thank you!
Welcome home, son.
scotland's proud of you.
l'm proud of scotland.
Let's party!
That's it. Now...
