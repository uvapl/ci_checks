So, what's on
your mind, Luke?
Nothing.
I mean, I can
make something up.
Fine.
Make something up, then.
Okay.
Um,
- I'm having trouble getting laid.
- Common problem.
How old are you
again, Luke?
Old enough
to be getting laid.
And getting older every day.
Have you ever
gotten laid?
Two years ago, I fucked
Katie Randall in Battery Park.
But she had drank
like two 40-ounces,
and the cops came
and broke us up before we...
So, she was drunk?
Home girl weighs,
like, 60 pounds,
and she drank two
40-ounce bottles of Crazy Horse.
- Crazy Horse?
- Look, Dr. Squires...
- Call me Jeff.
- Look, Jeff...
Dr. Squires...
How much
do you need, man?
You're the one
who needs this, son.
- How much?
- A quarter.
Well, I can give you two eighths.
It's the same thing.
- That entitles you to another...
- Forty-eight minutes.
Forty-eight minutes. If you go now,
you're getting ripped off.
I'm just not feeling all this
feeling shit today, Dr. Squires.
Luke, tomorrow's a very big day
in your life. One of the biggest.
And I look at you
and there's...
There's just
no joy, you know?
Tell Stephanie
I say what's up.
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, you ever feel
kind of like a fuck up?
Buying weed from the same dude
that deals to your daughter?
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter. Exactly.
- Later, Mr. Squires.
- I'm a doctor, Luke.
Dr. Squires.
<i>(LUKE:) I met Dr. Squires
in the spring of '94.</i>
<i>First as a client,
then as a patient.</i>
<i>At the beginning we didn't
talk about much of anything.</i>
<i>I don't know why I kept seeing him,
to be honest.</i>
<i>But sometimes it's nice
to have someone to talk to.</i>
<i>Even if you're
just talking shit.</i>
<i>He told me the drug thing was
a cry for help. Maybe he's right.</i>
<i>I am Luke Shapiro.
I'm a drug dealer.</i>
<i>Hear my cry.</i>
<i>My occupation takes me to
exotic places like Brooklyn and Queens.</i>
<i>Now, I like it most in the summer
when no one's around. Just me,</i>
<i>the sweaty girls in their short skirts
with their breasts and their panties,</i>
<i>which I like to see
when I can see them.</i>
<i>I like fly ladies. I like tank tops.
I like short skirts.</i>

Dr. Squires, can you, like,

Of course.
Why do you ask, Luke?
- Well, it's for me.
- No shit.
I think recently
I've been depressed.
I don't sleep good.
I think too much.
Luke, you ever hear
the saying,
"The unexamined life
is not worth living?"
Yeah. Maybe the
examined one isn't either.
Oh, no, come on,
don't talk like that.
Has this got something to do
with Kurt Cobain?
Look, the point is,
who says it's gotta be all
so fucking sad like that, you know?
Is there something
going on at home, Luke?
Yeah, of course something's
going on at home. What?
This is what
you get paid for?
Men do the things they need to do
to become the men they want to be.
- Do you understand?
- Sure.
That includes
asking for help.
- It's my parents.
- There you go.
What about them?
They just...
They act like kids,
you know?
My wife and I
are the same way.
We act like kids
all the time.
And why do you think
that is?
Life
has a
funny way of turning you
into the one thing you don't wanna be.
My life sucks.
- I swear, it sucks.
- Lucas.
Do you have any idea
what I would give to be you again?
Not you, specifically, but me at your age?
It doesn't get any better.
- Tell me that's not true.
- Oh, you're fucking living, Luke.
It's great, living. Get your heart broken.
Find yourself face down in the gutter.
Get your pulse up.
Make a real mess of your life, son.
This is what you tell
all your patients?
You're not
depressed, Luke.
- You're sad. There's a difference.
- No, I'm depressed.
I'm mad depressed, yo.
So just give me some of those happy pills
and we can call it a day.
Sorry, Luke.
I can't do that.
And how do you
suggest I deal, then?
I suggest you talk about it
with a friend.
- Like I said, I don't have any friends.
- You have me.
Great.
Yo, Shapiro.
- Yo.
- What's up, man?
Steph, what up?
Who's this?
This is Jesus Christ.
From my stepdad's first marriage.
Bet I can guess
what you're doing here.
Yeah, your stepdad
paged me.
Dude smokes more weed
than I do, it's pathetic.
- You like him?
- Squires?
(CHUCKLING) Not really.
But you should hear about
some of the crazy people
that come into
that guy's office.
- He tells you about that shit?
- Yeah.
But, I mean he's not, like
supposed to tell you, right?
There's confidentiality
and what not?
Whatever. I don't know.
He tells me anyway.
Like there's this one guy he sees,
I'm not kidding, a chronic masturbator.
- Uh...
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.
- The guy jerks off seven times a day.
Literally.
And when his nuts are dry,
he just lies in bed
with his hands down his pants,
like, touching himself
and shit.
- Jesus Christ, no.
- Oh, it's all right. It's all good.
- Sorry.
- Don't trip.

She's hot.
I'm sorry about the cop stuff.
I just...
You know, with Giuliani and the stories
you hear, you can't be too careful.
So I had to do this
today, though,
because I have this guy
coming into town tomorrow
and we don't have anything
to talk about unless we're stoned.
But if we're stoned,
in bed he's like...
He's a really nice guy.
Luke, can I ask you something?
Just for a sec.
Why are men
so complicated?
Is it because
I'm intimidating?
Am I intimidating because
I play an instrument?
No.
- You play an instrument?
- No, I know.
I forgot you don't know
anything about me.
I mean, I don't really need to know
anything about you, Elanor.
I played in a band in the '80s.
Well, in '82 we were really big.
What about you?
Stephanie? Right?
You must have some insight
into the mind of men.
I mean, he must
be a handful.
- Oh, we're not that.
(CHUCKLES) - We're not like that.
I think you're really beautiful
and you have really good chemistry.
Don't you think you should try it once
and just see how it feels?
Elanor, you know,
I could just sell you some weed
and we could leave it at that.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
A quarter of bubble gum?
Yeah.
- All right.
- We're gonna...
Yeah. And the door, when you shut it,
it just locks behind you.
Thanks, you guys.
Yo, Shapiro, you should take my number.
Okay. Call me some time.
- Call you?
- Yeah.
- You mean, like, for weed?
- No, man. To hang out.
This city can get so lonely
when there's nobody to talk to.
I think we could
be friends.
- Friends?
- Yeah, friends. You know, like,
homies, buddies, amigos.
Just take my number, okay?
All right, word.
I'll definitely call you.
What do you want
from me, Luke?
I don't know.
Come on, Luke,
you can tell me.
After all, I'm just
in your head.
Be honest.
Do you wanna do
dirty things to me?
Not, like,
especially dirty.
Just, like, normal dirty.
Do you want to fuck me?

<i>I've been thinking about your dilemma
a lot recently, Luke.</i>
- What's my dilemma?
- The girl thing.
Luke, back when I went to school,
drug dealers had no problem getting girls.
In fact, that's why
I always wanted to be one.
Were you popular in high school,
Dr. Squires?
Well, I wouldn't
say popular, no.
I wasn't one of those cool kids,
if that's what you're asking.
I played baseball,
I was a debater...
Did you ever
wanna kill yourself?
- Not till much later.
- Then you must have been popular.
I'm not.
This has got nothing to do
with being popular, Luke.
You're just not
trying hard enough.
<i>(SCOFFS)</i>
You must think about it.
The different scenarios.
Random sex in phone booths,
chance encounters in discos,
the way they smell,
the things they say,
even when they're saying
nothing at all.
<i>(SNORTS)</i>
I mean,
I'm married, so I don't contemplate
that type of thing.
No.
Of course not.
Surely there's
someone, Luke.
Yeah.
This one girl.
That's fantastic, Luke. Who is she?
Does Stephanie know her?
No.
No, she goes
to school downtown.
- So what's the problem?
- She just wants to be friends.
- What makes you think that?
- She said so.
Make her like you, Luke.
That's what I did with my wife.
How did you do that?
Be her friend.
Confide in her, earn her trust.
Then, when you are
least threatening to her,
grab her and stick your tongue so far down her throat
she starts to gag from pleasure.
- Can I grab her tits, too?
- Baby steps, Luke.
Right.
Pursue her, Luke.
You're the perfect age for it.
You haven't yet been systematically numbed
to the allure of romance.
You still have
your youthful...
<i>(GRUNTING)</i>
I got it.
Young men need sex, Luke.
All men, actually.
I can get you a hooker,
if you like.
God, I was this close
to respecting you.
Big mistake, Luke.
Call your girl.
You don't need medication, Luke.
You just need to get laid.

All right, that's enough, kids.
You are all too young to be in here anyway.
Oh, come on.
They're all 18.
Since when is
the drinking age 21?
<i>(UNION:)
Bye, Haydn!</i>
- Since forever.
- Fucking Giuliani.
Look around you, Luke,
is this what you want for your mind?
For your life? You want it to be
like this city?
Sweep all the nasty bits under the rug?
Make everything okay?
He puts the homeless people in prison, you know?
These people are sick, mentally.
They're being put in jail.
What do you think about that, Luke?
- Doesn't seem right.
- No.
No, it doesn't. That's why
I don't want you on medication, Luke.
You may as well open up a Starbucks
in your brain. You follow me?
Don't jump for the quick fix.
This whole fucking city wants a quick fix.
Embrace your pain.
Make it a part of you.
You don't want to be like them.
I don't want you to be like them.
So, you've never taken
any of that stuff?
Jesus, Luke, I'm on all of it.
I don't want you to be like me, either.
Sex is a drug too,
you know?
More powerful than any
synthetic pharmaceutical.
Yeah? Is that why you go around
trying to fuck little girls?
That was just
second base.
Oh, second base, huh?
Hey, what happened to getting fixed first?
Sometimes getting laid
is getting fixed, you know?
Except for dogs.
Now break out that blunt.
- This is a joint.
- Joint. I know that.
- Why'd you do that, Luke?
- Tag this wall?
I'm just kind of putting my stamp on it,
fucking let people know I was here.
- It's illegal, isn't it?
- It is.
- May I?
- You may.
- Just be careful.
- Careful.
M.D.
- Excellent penmanship, Dr. Squires.
- Why, thank you.
- Oh, no, I thank you.
- No, no, no, I thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.
- M.D.
- Hey! You two!

Who put you up to this, boys? Giuliani?
You got some kind of quota to fill?
Used to be,
you could lick a sheet of acid,
hold up a bank,
fuck a whore in Times Square
without any of you batting an eyelash.
Now, one blunt, we're in the clink.
This whole city's fucked.
We give you character!
Hey, shut the hell up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, now, brother.
Join the revolution!
- What are you in here for?
- I stabbed my wife in the pussy.
Oh, wow!
(SOFTLY) Yo, Squires, maybe we should
keep this on the DL, all right?
- Yo, DL!
- Quiet!
(MAN 1:) - Hey, shut up!
(MAN 2:) - Please, come on!
Shapiro!
Squires!
You made bail.
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>
Bail.
(DOOR LOCK BUZZING)
- Hi there, Stepdaddy.
- Hi, precious.
- Hey, Steph.
- Shapiro.
Thanks a lot for getting
my stepdad thrown in prison.
You know, you're really
a great influence on him.
- But it wasn't my fault.
- It was my fault.
I know. I was kidding.
Anyway...
- What are you doing today?
- Shapiro's busy.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Okay, well, look, Squires, why don't you
just take the car back to the garage,
and I won't tell my mom
about this whole prison thing
and Shapiro's
coming with me.
Don't touch
my daughter, Luke.
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter.
So, what's the deal
with you and my stepdad?
Are you guys,
like, gay together?
- We're friends, I guess.
- Weird.
Not really.
- He's very immature.
- I know.
Him and my mom fight about that
all the time.
I know.
We got more in common
than you think, Steph.
<i>Now, I've got something new for you.
Step up and tap. Go up and tap. Long body.</i>
<i>Remember that knee?
Give me one knee here and then a grapevine.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>
Don't you wanna know
where I was last night?
Do you want to tell me?
- I was having an affair.
- Good for you.
I was in prison.
I went to jail.

<i>(LAUGHING)</i>
So, how come we, like,
never hung out in school?
'Cause I was a loser.
I mean, not like a loser-loser,
you know, but
I was definitely the most popular
of the unpopular.
Or maybe the most unpopular
of the popular.
Maybe.
Either way, you're
mad out of my league.
- So what, I'm slumming now?
- Perhaps.
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

Hello.
Can I make you

Absolutely.
- Where have you been?
- I think I'm in love.
Well, that's wonderful.
Who's the lucky girl?
Stephanie Squires.
<i>(AUDIENCE LAUGHING ON TV)</i>
- You're up late.
- Oh, hi. So are you.
You have a nice day
with Luke?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.
Do you like him?
I don't know.
What do you care?
Do you like-like him?
Maybe, yeah.
- He's a drug dealer.
- Yeah, I know. Thank you.
Look, I'm really not in the mood for a
father daughter moment right now, Dr. Squires.
Well, may I watch TV
with you?
- Whatever.
- Cool.
So, fill me in.
Well, basically there's been, like,
this big misunderstanding,
- and Mr. Furley thinks Jack's gay.
- I think I've seen this one.
Oh, good morning, Luke.
You're up early.
Couldn't sleep.
It's mad hot.
What's that?
- We're getting evicted?
- Keep your voice down.
I'll take care of it.
I've got a very big deal coming through.
It's not a problem.
- Where will we go?
- I don't know. Downtown, maybe? Jersey?
Not everyone has to live
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Well, I can't live
in Jersey.
Look, I messed up,
and I'm trying to fix it.
- Then fix it.
- All I can do is try.
Be a man, Dad.
Fix it.
What can I do, Luke?
Deal pot?
I don't think you'd be
very good at that.

She's not for you.
What's so bad

She'll break your heart, Luke.
She's just bored.
- That's not true.
- Fine. Ignore my advice.
What? You think she's hot?
You want to fuck her?
Next thing you know,
you've wasted your entire life
on a girl you got nothing
in common with, Luke.
Actually, I was just trying to listen
to your advice, Dr. Squires.
Remember living?
And who said anything
about my entire life?
This is it, Luke. This is your life.
The choices you make.
And I guess you've chosen
to be a hoodlum drug dealer,
who latches onto the only girl
who'll pay attention to him,
simply because he's scared
of being alone.
And what about you?

Telling me not
to take medication.

You're a fucking

Yeah.

Right.
So, what are you doing
this weekend?
- Nothing.
- Good.
My mom and Squires are going to
Barbados or something,
so my house in
Fire Island is free.
I was wondering if you wanted
to join me for some beachcombing.

More like
a honeymoon.

I think so.

ask you something.
Uh-oh.
What's going on here?
What do you mean?
I've never been
in this situation before.
And what situation
is that?
Chilling
with a girl
that likes me,
who I like.
I'm just wondering,
you know,
what happens?
What happens when
everybody comes back?
What do you mean?
Like, do I turn into a pumpkin?
Basically, yeah.
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter?
Why not?
Because how could anything
possibly matter right now?
You know what
your problem is, Shapiro?
It's that you just have this really shitty
way of looking at things, you know?
I don't have
that problem.
I just look
at the dopeness.
But, you, it's like you just look
at the wackness, you know?

they need to do

they need to become
- or something?
- No.
Well, I need
your help.

You know anybody
who could use some weed?

I need to unload this month.
We could probably
work something out.

Dr. Squires, we're gonna do it right.
- All right? You gotta be more careful.
- Don't worry, Luke.
- I'm not going back to prison.
- Good.
Let's establish a few ground rules.
Number one, we use pagers.
Someone pages us, we call them back
from a payphone.
We never use home phones
for this type of stuff. Never.
That's great, Luke. I already have
a pager for my medical practice.
All right, good.
Number two, we sell weed by the gram,
by the eighth, and by the ounce.
Gram's the highest profit margin,
but it's also the most potent,
that's why we try to encourage people
to buy the grams.
Principal Edwards, I can give you
two grams for 125 bucks, all right?
Anything less than that,
I don't make a profit.
You always were
very good at math, Luke.
All right,
11 grand,
plus another 10 Zs
at a grand a Z.
It's a start.

- How's your mother?

Now, how much marijuana
can I get for you today?
Exactly how much money are we trying

- Yo!
- Hi, Steph.
- Hey...
- Look,
I know the summer's
almost over
but I think we can
make this work.
- Luke...
- Just hear me out, all right?
People do the long-distance thing
all the time, you know,
and we're not going to school
that far away from each other.
It's like a four-hour train ride, so,
we could alternate weekends, whatever.
(JUSTIN:) - Is that Shapiro?
- Is that Justin?
Oh, Shapiro.
Hi, baby.
Yo, you got any weed?
No.
Okay.
<i>(SIGHS)</i>
- Look, Luke...
- Where's Squires?
- He's in Fire Island.
- Peace.
Yo, wait.

<i> Blunts in the dip
Forty dogs in my lip </i>
<i> Had a box
Boom, boom. The bass will blast </i>
<i> We was laughing
at all the girls that passed </i>
<i> Conversation
Brothers had begin to discuss </i>
<i> Hey yo, Ra!
Remember that kid ya bust? </i>
<i> Oh, yeah, he ran
But he didn't get far </i>
<i> 'Cause I dropped him </i>
<i> Not knowin'
exactly what lied ahead </i>
<i> My little brother

it's a hot day in the summer </i>
<i> Didn't expect
to come across a crazy gunner </i>
Luke.
<i> "Check it for the bag
and the dough" </i>
<i> But he was brave
looked him in the eye and said, "No!" </i>
<i> Money splattered him... </i>
I apologize for the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.
You've been doing
all these drugs?
It's an experiment.
An experience.
Life. Salvation. Drugs.
Go ahead.
I've never done most of
this stuff before, Jeff.
Come on, Luke,
be a pal, do it.
<i> Flashbacks
I was laughin' all the time </i>
<i> I taught him
all about the bees and birds </i>
<i> But I wish I had a chance
to sing these three words </i>
<i> After laughter </i>
<i> comes tears </i>
<i>(WAVES CRASHING)</i>
The ocean.
This is all
I need, Luke.
Forget the city,
the city is wrong.
I just want to wrap myself
in the ocean.
I cannot
- speak.
- That's the spirit, Luke.
Hit me with it!
Come on, hit me!
You don't think I can take it? I can
take everything you got, fucking sea!
<i>(LAUGHTER ECHOING)</i>
I want a
- vagina.
- You said it, Luke.
I should have known when she
told me she didn't like dogs.
There's certain people you just
can't trust, you know, Luke?
Listen to me.
Never trust
anyone who doesn't smoke pot
or listen to Bob Dylan. You hear me?
Never trust anyone
who doesn't like the beach.
Never, ever,
ever,
trust anyone who says
they don't like dogs.
If you meet someone
who doesn't like dogs,
you alert the authorities immediately,
and sure as shit don't marry them!
Okay.
Okay.
Nothing's okay.
None of it's
gonna be okay,
everything is going
to be terrible.
I tried to kill myself
twice today.
Once with pills, turns out I have
a very high tolerance for those.
Next by hanging.
The hanging is very hard. The weight.
You lose too much weight,
or you put on too much weight...
Oh, well.
- Dr. Squires, what are you talking about?
- I don't know.
I just...
I'm done.
This is it. Last call, Luke.
I'm glad you're here to see me off.
- Where you going, Dr. Squires?
- In there.
I'm ready to die, Luke.
Stop fucking around, Jeff.
I'm the weird old guy, remember?
You said so yourself.
Look, I didn't mean it, all right?
You're my friend.
You're my best friend.
So just, please,
would you come back for me?
You're not
worth it, Shapiro!
So that was all
bullshit, right?
All that stuff about embracing your pain,
making it a part of you?
You can't do this!
You can't just give up.
Life is hard and it's full of pain
and what not,
but we take it
'cause there's great stuff, too!
And we can do it
because we have friends!
Because we help
each other!
Stop! Stop!
Luke!
That was really fucking cheesy,
what you said just then.
There's enough assholes
in the world, Dr. Squires.
Don't be another one.
Now you sound like me.
You wanna go to the city
to fill out my prescriptions?
Sounds good.
Thank you, Luke.
How you feeling?
Please, don't
do that again.
- All right? You scared me.
- I'm sorry.
Dr. Squires,
I gotta get back.
To my folks.
Where you living
these days, Luke?
We're moving in
with my grandparents.
- In New Jersey.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry to live it.
I'm sorry about
Stephanie, too.
She would have been
a lucky girl.
Good luck in school.
Try and fuck a black girl.
I never got the chance at college.
(SIGHING)
Baby steps.
It'll be okay.
- I can't answer that.
- It wasn't a question.
- Peace, Doc.
(SNIFFLING) - Peace out, Luke.
Luke. Hey.
Hey.
- Look, man, I just wanted to say...
- Do me a favor, Steph.
Don't say nothing, okay?
Just stand there
till I leave.
I wanna remember this.
- I've never done it before.
- Never done what?
Had my heart broken.

Luke?
Have you had
any more thoughts
about what you're gonna be
as far as a profession goes?
- Mom, he's got time.
- I'm just asking.
Actually, I'm thinking
about becoming a shrink.
Psychology!
It's not quite the shoe business,
but it's a very interesting field.
I figure I'm an expert 'cause everyone
around me is so fucking crazy, you know?
