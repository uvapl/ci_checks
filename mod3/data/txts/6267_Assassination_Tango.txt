All right, hold it up.
Hold the music. Hold everything.
Hold everything.
Let's have a line over here.
Make it two lines--
one for the men
and one for the women.
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Don't be bashful.
You don't want
to dance with me?
No?
Thanks a lot. OK, OK.
You always gotta go somewhere,
and you start with the basics...
so you can always come back
to them, right? OK?
Hey, Stella, come here, baby.
Frankie, come on, baby.
Let's do it.
This is Stella.
You know her, right?
She's the star
of the place here.
And I just want to say that
your last class was wonderful...
but this time, I want it
to look a little more New York.
So I want you to use the floor
and bring it down.
-Brooklyn stylle.
-A little less up, more down.
All right, let's concentrate
on the basics now.
Let's go.
And one, two, three,
one, two, three...
back step.
That's nice.
See how she holds the beat?
She doesn't rush it.
Get the rhythm goin'.
Don't rush it, see?
OK, you ready? It's you and me.
Ready? Come on.
-Maybe later.
-What do you mean, later?
Later.
-What, are you shy or something?
-No.
I don't want to sit here
all night.
-Then don't.
-Then don't?
-OK, I'll go dance.
-OK, go.
OK, go? OK, I'm gonna get
somebody to dance with you then.
One of those guys.
Hey, young fella. Young fella.
Hey, hey. Hey, shortyl.
Shortyl.
You don't want
to dance with him?
Here you go, pumpkin.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
Look at that.
All right,
give us a smoother step.
Slide. Slide. You're pickin' up
your feet too much.
That's right. They pick up
their feet too much.
Who's the best dancer
out there?
-Stella.
-Stella? She's terrific.
Oh, yeah. You're lookin'
a little bit more like Frankie.
Come on, little children.
What are you doin' over there?
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, OK. Hey, don't you want
to do a little swing?
A little--a little swing?
-You want to?
-Yeah, you know...
-OK.
-OK.
But don't you get fancy on me,
all right?
OK. Remember what I taught you?
Let's go, you two.
Let's go.
These people dance
like I play polo.
John J. is here
with his daughter tonight.
No, he said that's
his girlfriend's little girl.
-She's a cute kid.
-Yeah, that's his daughter.
I wouldn't want to be the guy
that goes out with her...
when she gets older,
I'll tell you that.
-You'd have to bob and weave.
-Worse than that.
Can I have a dance
for your birthday?
I will,
but you better be there.
Yeah? Or what?
-Or else.
-Or else.
-What'd you learn in school?
-I did the math...
with the two digits
on the outside.
-What kind of math?
-Decimals.
-Oh, my God.
-And division.
I forgot that long ago.
I bet you forgot
your steps, though.
I forget the decimals,
you forget the steps.
I forget the decimals,
you forget the steps.
Hey, kiddo. What's up?
How are you doing?
Good.
So, what do you want
for your birthday?
I don't know.
You know better than me.
-Think so?
-Yeah.
Yeah, OK.
I'll think of something good.
So...wait a minute. I forget.
When is your birthday?
Is it in three weeks?
You know
it's a week from Sunday.
-lt is?
-You know it is.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I forgot.
I think I can make it.
I think I can.
You better, or you're
in trouble if you don't.
Big trouble.
I know. I'll be there. OK?
I'll be there.
You like my hat?
-Sharp.
-Yeah? Good.
OK. A little kiss.
Have sweet dreams, all right?
Listen...
as long as I know you...
I got you under my wing, OK?
You're safe, all right?
Remember that.
-Love you.
-Love you.
Hey! Hey, come here!
Hey, come here,
you little prick!
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
-John J., how you doin'?
-Frankie, how are you?
-All right.
-I like this band. Nice.
Stella--good singer,
good dancer.
I may have another job for you
at the end of next week.
What do you mean, next week?
It's a little unusual,
but the pay is good.
-Yeah.
-Yeah?
Come on. Next week?
What are you talkin' about?
You'd have to travel
quite a ways, but like I said...
the pay is better
than the average job.
And it's only three days.
But next week. I mean--
It's a little different lately.
Let me think about it.
Yeah, well, relax.
Don't worry about it.
-Sleep on it.
-OK.
I'll meet you here tomorrow
around noon, all right?
-I'll be there, too, OK?
-All right.
Hang in there.
And remember,
tomorrow is promised to no one.
You know what I mean?
Jesus. OK.
Let's go, honey.
You're gonna be late.
-It's five of nine.
-I know, Mom.
OK, come on.
You forgot your lunch.
Here's your lunch.
Have you got your math homework?
Oh, yeah.
You finished it, right?
-I think so.
-OK.
Hey, you forgot
the most important thing.
Oh, yeah.
Come here, baby.
Bye-bye, honey.
-I gotta go.
-OK. Oh, yeah.
Bye, Johnny! See you later!
-Hey, Jenny.
-Hi.
Did you do your homework
last night on decimals?
Yeah. It was so hard.
-How's Frankie doing?
-Frankie's all right, you know.
How's that club
going these days?
Real good. Although, I don't
get there too much lately.
I'd come by...
but I don't think Frankie
likes me around that much.
Why not?
You can come around anytime.
Frankie's all right
once you get to know him.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
You still dancing?
Some. Not like I used to,
but some. Yeah.
You look a little more tired
than I remember, John.
A little more worn out.
All those late hours
you're keeping.
Whatever.
I couldn't keep
those kind of hours myself.
I gotta hand it to you.
It all depends
on what you're used to, OK?
Yeah.
Come over to the club any time.
Frankie's not a bad guy.
Say hello to your partner,
whatever his name is.
See you around.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on.
I want to say something.
Come here. I want to make sure
we understand each other here.
Did you say something
about my face?
What do you mean, face?
Just because
you're a fuckin' cop...
you think you got the right
to tell me...
that I got wrinkles on my face?
All I said was you look a little
tired, John, a little worn out.
I didn't say anything
about wrinkles.
-You didn't?
-No.
Whether you meant exactly that
or not, I don't know.
But that's pretty much what you
meant. Wouldn't you say that?
If you misinterpreted
what I said, I'm sorry.
No, no, no. And in the future,
if there is a future...
it would behoove you to keep
your opinions to yourself...
about my face
or anything else about me.
Come on, John.
What are you talkin' about?
OK, enough said.
Enough of your shit.
Just keep your remarks
to yourself. Understood? OK?
Will you listen to this?
You got a problem.
Well, I wouldn't want
that problem to become yours.
So remember what I said and
keep your opinions to yourself.
Just clean the streets up, OK?
Hey, guys!
Once a cop,
always a fuckin' cop!
Hey!
Do you know you have the best
hair of all your sisters?
Really,
yours is really the best.
Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.
-This is for you.
-Thanks very much.
-Bye, baby.
-Get ready, OK?
Yeah, if you're lucky.
-How do I look?
-Hey, hey, hey. You look fine.
So funny.
He won't let me touch his hair.
He lets me do the pedicure,
lets me do the manicure.
I can do whatever I want.
Let me see the Ali shuffle.
Give me some Ali shuffle.
Ali shuffle.
There you go.
You still got it.
How you guys doing today?
All right?
Hey, John J.,
have a seat there.
So, what's up, Frankie?
Hey, what's up with you,
farm boy?
You tell me.
That's why I'm here.
You ready to travel?
-You ready to travel?
-Where to, Frankie?
The plane ticket is in my pocket
in my coat over there.
OK, wait a minute.
Let's talk business here.
So, guys...
Hey. Hey, guys.
-Give me ten minutes, OK?
-What? Why?
Why? Because I said so,
that's why.
Just give me ten minutes.
Wait over there, and then...
Hey, you. Come here.
Will you excuse us
for a minute, please?
Thank you.
Hey, fellas, fellas.
Could you go?
We got some business
to attend to, OK?
I appreciate it. Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah. That's my man.
Where to, Frankie?
Somewhere south of the border...
at the other end
of South America.
Well, when would I be back?
Three days maximum.
My partners were thinking...
of sending somebody
that would fit in...
somebody that's more Latin.
But I didn't agree with them
for a second.
Fit in?
What do you mean by that?
They felt that someone Latin
might actually fit in better...
but I argued that all around,
you were the best guy...
and probably the only guy.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Latin?
What is that shit?
Since when do I not fit in?
I agree. I agree.
What is that Latin shit, then?
I mean--
Oh, man. Maybe eight years
in Guatemala doing what I do...
doesn't qualify me
as a Latin...
but it certainly proves
that I know my way around...
when it comes
to seeing a thing through...
in the most effective
and correct way.
I told them you were fluent
enough to pull this thing off...
that you speak Spanish--
Who's fluent?
Hey, who's fluent?
I could do a better job
than these other jerks...
even if I was the village mute.
And the Latin spic tylpes
that you talk about...
would never have been the ones
in line ahead of me...
if the powers that be
had suddenly wanted...
Daniel Ortega
the fuck out of there, right?
I think I would've been
fluent enough for that.
Forget mining the harbor.
Now, who's gonna pull
the trigger, Frankie? Hey?
Besides, I don't want
the fucking job to begin with.
But if you do want it
done right, I wouldn't worry...
about who's fluent with this
shit or that shit or whatever.
I'd worry about who's
the most qualified, right?
Listen. Listen to me.
Even if I'm too old
for this shit to begin with--
and that's the only drawback
I can see. I mean--
Who needs it?
I agree.
That's why I'm sending you.
That's why I bought
the plane tickets for you.
All I'm saying is that
if you want it done right...
then do it right, that's all.
That's what I'm sayin'.
Calm down, will you?
-What else can I say?
-OK, sorry.
It'll take three days--
no longer.
You got my word on that,
farm boy.
One of those jobs popped up.
I'm down and back in three days.
You know, no more than that.
And what will you be doing
exactly?
Exactly? I don't know.
I'll be helping to set up...
some high-level
securityl systems...
on these coffee plantations
in the mountains in Guatemala.
-Oh.
-Oversee it.
Sort of like the work
I used to do...
right before
I met you and Jenny.
You'll be back by this weekend?
Oh, I have to be.
-Oh, yeah.
-Have to be.
That was part of the deal.
I wouldn't go near the job
unless that was understood.
You know, when you do
the work that you do...
I always get a little nervous.
-You do? Why?
-Yeah.
I feel
it's totally foreign to me...
and I don't know,
I don't know how to say it...
but it's always mysterious
to me.
I'm a mysterious man.
Yes.
It always passes, but...
I don't know,
the way I experience it...
it's very strange.
It's like you become someone
else for a little while...
and then you're back.
You mean I get sort of distant
for a while?
Yeah, maybe.
It's more than that.
Look, she's going to jump.
-Oh. Oh, Jenny.
-Nice.
-Beautiful, beautiful.
-Oh, that's wonderful.
I used to ride
when I was a kid...
but I'm afraid
I'm too old for that stuff.
Oh, hey, don't start that.
Don't start that with me.
You know, I was thinking...
What do you think of this?
I'm going to get her...
ten more of these private
lessons for her birthday.
-Think she'll like that?
-No, Johnny, she'll love that.
-Think so?
-Oh, she'll love that.
Good.
You are so good to her.
I think she's like the daughter
that you never had.
-Think so?
-Mm-hmm.
You know,
this may sound strange...
but I think
she's better than a daughter.
That's sweet. That is so sweet.
She feels the same way
about you.
-You think so?
-Yes, I do. She does.
Well, I'm going to tell you
something right now--she better.
She better, or she's in trouble.
You're so good to us.
I have to be. I love her.
Yeah. He leaves tonight.
And it's like I said--
if he doesn't get him,
then it's for expenses.
If he gets him...
and the odds are greatly
in his favor that he will...
then we collect the whole thing.
Yeah.
Well, unless you set up
an impossible situation...
it's as good as done.
Yeah. What can I tell you?
He's the best.
Gracias.
Pleasure to meet you.
How's it going?
Good.
Let's go.
The car's right here.
What is your name?
My name? Miguel.
-Miguel? Nice to meet you.
-A pleasure.
-You speak Spanish.
-A little. Just a little.
So, what do you do
in the States?
I do many things.
What do you do?
What kind of business?
Right now, I do a little bit
of this, a little bit of that.
I do a few things,
this and that, myself.
Believe it or not, I own
a string of beautyl parlors.
I actually did some hair at one
time, if you can believe that.
You are joking?
What do you mean?
The beautyl parlors
are for men or women?
-No, for women.
-For women.
You have a girlfriend?
What do you mean by that?
Because you say, "l have
a beautyl parlor for men"...
do I have a girlfriend?
Of course I have a girlfriend.
-Oh.
-Of course I have a girlfriend.
Yeah, a beautiful
girlfriend, and...
I assume that
the name Tony Manas...
means something to you.
It might, yeah. Why?
He's a very influential...
you can even say powerful man
here in Buenos Aires.
So I've heard. I think
I'm supposed to meet with him...
sometime later today
or tomorrow, right?
Yes.
You want Miguel or l
to accompany you?
Oh, I'll find him, if it's OK.
I like wandering around
on my own.
I feel more comfortable
that way, if you don't mind, OK?
I don't mind.
This is a...
a very sensitive situation...
we have here.
We've been putting this
together for a long time.
My uncle...
my aunt...
they suffer a lot.
And now we feel that we have
all the elements in place...
and we want this
to be carried out...
efficiently and quickly.
OK.
I think the job
that you have to do here...
will take you
no more than three days.
You should be in New York
by this week.
What job?
The job
that you were sent here to do.
Oh, yeah, that job. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, right, right. Yeah.
This is very important for us.
In the seventies,
in the eighties...
some people did terrible things
in this country...
and our judicial system
did not punish them.
A strange immunityl
surrounds them.
They have power.
They have authorityl.
They are untouchables.
Interesting.
There's always two sides.
I don't get into politics.
You want to know my politics?
My politics is put the money
on the table, that's it.
I'm here to sightsee, relax...
look for prize fighters,
make new friends...
but we'll see about
this other thing as well, OK?
And remember this, if you would.
Nobody down here
has anything on me.
Nobody--you, you, you--nobody.
Not unless you find a weapon
in my hand and a dead body.
And that's not going to happen.
Nothing can be proved
if you can't prove anything...
so if this is going
to be done at all...
it's going to be done right,
and it's going to be my way.
I'm sure you understand that.
OK?
It's OK.
Ma'am...it was a pleasure.
The meal was excellent.
For me?
Your son?
Who died?
The poor thing.
Thank you. Good luck.
-OK.
-Miguel...
please take our guest
to the hotel.
Si, Hernando.
Nice meeting you, sir.
Both for my wife and myself...
it is a pleasure
having you here.
That was a wonderful meal.
She's a very nice lady,
the Senora.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
She's a good woman, my aunt.
She's not really my aunt...
but that's what I call her
for years.
Yeah?
We--she doesn't know
who you are or why you're here.
That's good.
-But she knows.
-That's OK.
We haven't said a word,
but she knows.
Maybe after
all of this is over...
she'll be paid back a little
bit for all of her suffering.
It's the worst thing that can
happen to a mother...
or a parent that I can think of.
Yeah.
How close is my hotel room
to where I get this guy?
It's close. It's certainly
very, very close--close enough.
Well, I'll determine that,
thank you.
We're all very glad you're here,
Mr. Farm Boy.
I want you to stop short
of the hotel.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Stop right here.
-Here?
-Yeah, right here. Stop.
OK. Understand?
There's a lot of things
you got to learn.
I'll see you later.
Yeah, later. Gracias.
-One-three-one, OK?
-Gracias.
-The first floor.
-Gracias.
-Good sleep.
-Thank you.
Gracias.
Good night.
OK.
-Where is the Huracan Club?
-Right around the corner.
-Are you Italian?
-No, Argentine.
Tony Manas, where is he?
Upstairs? Thanks.
All right.
-Sir, which one is Manas?
-That way.
-Mr. Manas, nice to meet you.
-How are you?
Close the door, please.
Yeah.
You know, Frankie said
he beat your cousin...
in a close fight
in a polo round years ago...
and they never could make
the rematch.
Now, is that true?
Yes, I remember. I like Frank.
Yeah, good guy, good guy.
-So, you are here.
-Yep, I'm here.
So, what do you have for me?
I have this for you.
It's all your bullets.
I think you need only one, no?
Well, it usually
only takes one, yeah.
That's right.
Fine.
You'll be out of here
by the weekend.
This man is coming
from the country...
tomorrow or the next day.
He takes coffee
in the garden in the evening.
OK. In other words,
what you're saying is...
he has his habits.
He's a man of habits.
Only with his meals and coffee.
Is he old or young?
Older. He's a military man.
I believe in the military,
but he went too far.
He crossed the line.
I see. I see.
If you need,
here is my private number...
but only if it's an emergency.
And rip it up
when you leave the country.
Thank you.
We depend on you
to be fast and efficient.
That's why they sent me.
This is what I do, you know?
Right.
We'll get you out of here
in one hour, two after.
Yeah, I have to get back.
It's very important. I have to.
Trust me.
It's almost one hundred percent.
No problem.
What do you mean by that?
It is almost impossible
for anything to go wrong.
Almost?
Listen, I didn't come
ten thousand miles...
to get my head blown off.
What guarantee do I have?
How tight is this thing?
Frankie knows everything...
but here, I am your man.
Knows what? I don't have to
tell you that Frankie's there.
I'm here. This is my ass
we're talking about...
not Frankie's, all right?
My ass.
OK. Take it easy. Trust me.
I have a contact
in the federal police.
What?
I have a contact
in the federal police.
-The federal police?
-Mm-hmm.
This is Argentina.
I see.
Very interesting.
So, who knows all this?
I mean, does Orlando know this?
-No.
-Does Miguel know this?
No. Only you, me, and Frankie
know this.
So, in other words...
you don't completely trust
Orlando or Miguel.
Orlando, yes. Miguel...it's OK.
Let's leave it at that.
OK, so in other words...
this would keep anybody
from stopping this...
until the last
possible moment...
to find out
this necessary information.
Is that right?
Of course.
OK. lnteresting, interesting.
OK, there's nothing else,
I guess.
One other thing.
This is OK for now,
but I may need...
something more powerful,
like a .222 with a scope, OK?
But we'll talk about that
later, all right?
OK. All right.
Yeah.
One moment, sir.
Let's stop here for a minute.
What's that they're supposed
to be doing in there?
What is that?
They are practicing tango.
Now you step in. Turn...
I've danced all my life.
I never saw any tango
like that before.
lnteresting.
You got boxing one floor...
tango underneath.
lnteresting set up.
So, this is the real tango, eh?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
lnteresting.
I like it, I like it.
Let's go. I like it.
The arm! Watch the arm!
Well done, boy.
Lovely!
Where have you been, senor?
I've been worried about you.
Well, I've been out, you know.
Here and there.
You were supposed
to meet me at six thirtyl.
It's ten of. Why so early?
I'm sorry.
I guess I got a little excited.
Well, don't be.
It doesn't pay to be excited.
Not even a little bit,
so, you know, relax.
I'll be right back.
Don't go away.
Here, sir.
Guard it with your life, OK?
-It's yours, right?
-Yes, of course.
OK. Ciao.
So, there's the house,
and that's the courtylard...
where always he has his meal
in the evenings...
when the weather is good, see?
What if the weather's not
very good? Then what do we do?
I don't know.
OK. You see,
the first mistake we made...
is to come up here
in the daylight.
It's dusk.
Yeah, well, you know...
I like to work from rooftops.
That's my stylle.
I make an overall blueprint in
my mind, you know, and then...
It's really the only place
to be alone in a crowded cityl.
I like it very much.
Let me show you something.
Any door, any window...
or any ledge,
any opening or whatever...
where he shows any part
of his body or his head...
I mean, I got him.
He's out of here.
But I can't do it
with a pea shooter.
I'm going to need a .222
with a scope, OK?
A .222 with a scope.
Tell that to Manas, OK?
-.222 with a scope?
-Absolutely.
Otherwise,
I might as well go home.
Here you go, girl.
You like those?
You better. You better.
Hey, what are you doing?
You're throwing rocks
at the wrong window.
You're waking up half the hotel.
What are you doing?
-I have news.
-About what?
-Can I go upstairs?
-No, you can't come upstairs.
I'm busy, OK?
But I'll be right down, OK?
You bastard.
You crazy...
Here's the man
who struck out Mickey Mantle.
Are you nuts?
What's the matter with you?
OK, what--where's your car?
I don't like
to drive the car at night.
I came on a bicycle.
Well, that makes sense.
I have bad news.
What do you mean, bad news?
Our friend in the country...
he had an accident
on his horse...
and he's in the hospital.
Our associates say he'll be
there for two, three weeks.
That's not true.
It's true.
I didn't come 10,000 miles
for you to lie to me.
-I'm not lying to you.
-No, that's bullshit.
That's not true.
I can't get out
of this frickin' country...
for at least three weeks...
because this guy
got busted up on a horse...
and we can't meet with him.
Now, that's what's going on.
-Are you sure?
-Of course I'm sure.
And that's why I'm pissed off...
because now I'm going to miss
Jenny's birthday...
after I made
a special promise to her.
That's what's going on.
You got to stay there
and finish the business, John J.
You can't be coming back yet.
I know that, Frankie.
Why do you think I'm calling?
All right, all right.
I'll make it up to you.
You don't understand, Frankie.
You don't make it up to me.
You miss the point.
I'm not concerned about me.
I mean, how do you make it up
to Jenny? Tell me that.
I'm sure she'll understand.
How is she going
to understand that, Frankie?
All right, all right,
listen, listen.
-Yeah.
-I'll call Maggie for you.
OK, you call, because
I'm too embarrassed to call.
You do it, OK?
OK, but in the meantime...
don't be rushing out of there
before the deal is over, OK?
Take your time.
It was too rushed before,
if you know what I mean.
OK, OK, but just call
Maggie and the kids...
and say hello for me, OK?
I won't be calling unless
it's an emergency, all right?
All right, all right, I'm sorry.
Ciao, Frankie.
I'm going to kill this guy.
Fucking take the job.
Fucking bastard!
You and your fucking jobs!
Shove it up your fucking ass,
you fuck!
This is the last time
I go down to this country...
for you, you fuck.
Find yourself
a new killing machine.
General Humberto Rojas
Miguel, can you hear me?
We're on top of things.
We even have access
to the Yankee's room.
Excellent!
When you step inside,
you turn...
He's checking you out.
He wants to dance with you.
Seven times.
Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me.
Do you speak English?
Yes, a little.
-You do?
-Yeah, I do.
I saw you dance seven times
in your club...
and now I want to make it eight.
You did what?
I saw you dance seven times...
and now
I want to make it eight times.
It wasn't me.
It wasn't you? Who was it?
-My twin sister.
-Your twin sister.
I don't buy that--
not your twin sister.
Yeah, it was me. It was me.
So, do you dance tango?
-Do I dance tango?
-Mm-hmm.
Well, I have,
but I would never admit to it...
after seeing
what you people can do.
Mm-hmm. It's a different animal.
Yeah. I've danced all my life.
My mother was a terrific dancer.
And, you know,
this is different.
It's beautiful, special.
-So...
-It's an honor to meet you.
Thank you so much. That's great.
So, where are you from?
Where do you think I'm from?
You have
kind of an edge to you...
so you might be from New York.
-You think so?
-Did I say that right? New York?
And the next question is...
where do I learn
how to do this tango?
At least the beginning,
the whole, you know...
so I can take it back
to New York with me.
-Right here.
-Here?
Milonga's--the right place
to learn to tango.
Milonga like the clubs...
the clubs
like we have in Brooklyn.
We have clubs like clubs here.
Now, are you...
Look, I'm embarrassed
to get out there...
I really am, because
I don't know what I'm doing...
but I'm game if you are...
if you want to show--
will you show me something?
I got to go, so...
What do you mean,
you got to go? I just got here.
Well, you have been here
for a while, so...
I just got here.
No, no, no.
You go too fast, my friend.
What, fast? What, fast?
But, no, really, I have
someone waiting for me, and...
But if you want,
I can give you a lesson--
not tomorrow, but the day after.
I'm shooting a commercial...
so if you want to come
in the afternoon.
Shooting a commercial?
Where?
It's called Museum La Boca.
Boca Museum.
-OK, so you got to go?
-Yeah, I got to go.
Really?
-Will you call me?
-Yeah. Have a good time.
Say bye to Olga for me.
-OK, bye. Nice to meet you.
-Ciao.
Mucho gusto, as they say.
So, what do I do now?
I don't know what to do now.
I'm just stuck here...
with egg on my face.
-Wanna dance?
-No, no, thank you.
-You sure?
-Yes, sure.
OK. Mucho gusto.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.
Next week.
See you next week.
Ciao.
Hey, thanks.
Oh, man!
Look at that precious thing.
A goddess!
Look at that sweet bread.
Where is the commercial?
Upstairs? Thank you.
Beautiful dance,
beautiful dance you did.
-You like it?
-Yeah, I loved it.
-Are you married?
-What?
-Are you married?
-If I'm married?
Behave.
Have you been practicing?
I'll see you next week.
-Ciao.
-Ciao, ciao.
Now let's go give you
your first tango lessons.
Oh, yeah? Where?
Don't ask.
That's my sister over there.
-She's nice.
-No, she's beautiful.
Yeah, I'd say.
Let's try to have
the same energy...
otherwise
we will look like this.
Who's better, you or her?
She is.
She's something.
She's a spitfire.
-I like it.
-You like it?
More!
The other leg.
Careful.
Thank you.
"Gancho."
(The hook)
-What's her name?
-Pirucha.
Bravo, Pirucha.
The first time I came here...
just this animal,
by doing nothing...
just got my attention,
you know?
-By doing nothing?
-By doing nothing.
For me, the panther
is the symbol of elegance.
You know, it really works.
So many people
show off and everything.
-Exactly.
-Like that tango in Europe.
Absolutely.
You know, like ballroom dance.
That's what I mean.
The same thing, yeah.
You see how they dance?
Hold this.
They do like this.
They dance like this, and
they look like they smell bad.
-You know this game?
-What game?
Stone, paper, and scissors?
I invented it.
No. You ready?
What are you going to do?
OK. I'm for coffee,
you're for ice cream.
-I'm for ice cream?
-Yeah.
-OK. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.
OK, best--no. Two out of three.
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.
OK. I won, kind of.
We go for coffee.
I won, but it's kind of a tie.
-Again.
-We go for coffee.
You're kind of a cheater.
I'm not a cheat--what?
Don't say that.
You were like, I don't know...
I know. Don't say that.
I never cheated on anything
in my life.
No? You never lie?
-No, I never lie.
-You never lie?
Never in my life.
I've found that tango people
are very negative.
They're very competitive
and very, you know...
Yeah. Criticizing.
So, yeah.
I'm kind of like an outsider...
like a black ship.
-Black what?
-Ship.
-Sheep.
-Sheep.
Ship. Black ship. Black sheep.
Here comes the black ship.
And over here's
the black sheep...
and over here we have
the black ship.
And a sailboat.
No...
But, you know...
The guy you dance with...
now, that's not your husband?
-Come on.
-Your boyfriend?
-No.
-No?
OK, I'm just curious.
I'm not gonna--
-Why did you guess that?
-I don't know.
I figured down here you dance
with who you're with.
-No. No, you know what I do?
-What?
You want to hear
something crazy that I do?
What? What do you do?
What?
What?
Now I can't tell you
what I do.
Tell me.
I discovered that if I buy
my favorite men's perfume...
and I put it on him,
I can dance.
-You can't?
-Yeah, I can dance better.
What happens if you don't
have the perfume on?
I dance OK.
But if he is sprayed
with the perfume that I like...
I just dance like I'm dancing
with somebody else.
Obviously,
he doesn't know this, right?
No, I never told him.
What does your husband do?
-I don't have a husband.
-You don't have a husband?
No, I don't have one.
Do you have a wife?
Kind of, yeah.
-Kind of?
-Kind of.
What that means, kind of?
That means all my life I never
had anything, you know...
and at this age in my life I've
finally decided to settle down.
Just with one?
-With one what?
-One woman.
-Two women.
-Wow.
She has a daughter.
Terrific.
-One and a half.
-Yeah.
That may be the real reason.
Have you ever cheated on her?
-Who?
-You.
-Who? On my wife?
-Well, future wife.
That's a pretty
personal question.
Well, you ask
too many questions.
I guess the answer is yes.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
I don't know.
Really?
I don't know.
-You travel a lot.
-Yeah, I do. I travel a lot.
So, does she travel with you?
-No, never.
-No?
Never.
So, anyway, my stepdaughter
is, you know, beautiful.
-How old is she?
-Ten.
Why is someone who doesn't have
your blood so special to you?
How that can happen?
She's everything to me.
I never had anything like this
before in my life.
She's my soul, she's my life,
she's my eyes.
-Really?
-She's my everything.
What can I say?
I can't explain it.
And what about the mother?
I love her.
-But no more than your daughter.
-No.
No way. No way. Never.
No children for you, right?
-Yeah.
-Yeah? You?
Yeah, me.
-How many you have?
-I have a daughter.
-Yeah? How old?
-She's two.
Yeah? That's nice.
-That's very nice.
-What's her name?
Manuelita.
That figures.
Manuelita, Manuela, Manuelita.
Hey, hey. Nice.
She's beautiful.
It's nice when she gets up
in the morning...
like she comes and wakes you up,
and you look at her...
and she has this very
special smile on her face...
and she leans to me
like this...
looks at you, and as soon
as you open your eyes...
one day she says to me,
"I love you to the moon."
-To the what?
-To the moon.
To the moon? That's nice.
Made me feel emotional.
Reminds me of my little girl.
She's special.
She's the only person
who makes me laugh and smile...
every day.
Yeah? That's nice.
When you think about her--
when I think about her...
it's just...
just great.
Yeah?
Yeah, that's nice.
So, anyway...
if I was a younger man...
livin' here--
I'm just theor--
Why always young? You're
obsessed with old and young.
I'm theorizing.
You think I'd have a chance?
-Chance for what?
-With you.
-Well, you have it now.
-What?
You have it now.
You--you--yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Welcome to Argentina,
my friend.
OK, I'll buy that.
I think I got
a different coffee than you.
I got a regular coffee.
You got a lagrima?
-Yeah.
-Can I have a taste of yours?
'Cause I think this--
I don't like regular coffee.
This is terrific. What is it?
A teardrop coffee.
No, take it, take it.
I like coffee better.
-I'll have to remember that.
-I like bitter coffee.
When I go back home,
I'll have to try to make that.
We're all ready.
In six or seven days,
we figure he'll be here.
Who's he?
The man in the courtylard.
How do you know all this?
How do we know all this?
Tony has
somebody on the inside...
who also has lost
several relatives.
-OK. I'll buy that.
-Similar to my uncle.
Either Miguel or I
will contact you...
or go by your hotel room.
No, that's no good.
No good.
We meet here or
some other place like it.
You don't repeat,
you understand me?
-You don't repeat.
-Sorry, I wasn't thinking.
Great.
-How am I doing?
-Pretty good.
Better?
Be gentle. Very gentle.
-Bounce, like you said?
-That's right.
-Smile.
-Smile.
Very good.
-That's an exit?
-That's right.
Be gentle.
Embrace me. Very softly.
Come on...move along.
Come on! Come on, kids!
Good morning, General.
Good morning.
"Se Alquila Habitación"
(Room for Rent)
OK, I've got
this one room here...
Facing the street is better...
I've got one in the front, but
there's some storage there...
Please, go ahead.
See? There's all that stuff...
No, it's OK, no problem.
I can take it away tomorrow.
-How much?
-One hundred dollars a week.
Here, this is for two weeks.
There's only one thing
I need to ask.
My mother sleeps
in the afternoons...
...please don't
make too much noise.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
You can visit us later
if you want.
Are you coughing, Mom?
I'm coming.
Be happy, Mom.
I rented the room to a Yankee.
No wonder you're coughing.
You're smoking!
Let's go in,
or you'll freeze to death.
We'll meet Miguel at
the same place as we did before.
La Boca.
-No way.
-Why? Why not?
Because I said no.
We'll meet at the coffee shop...
directly behind my hotel,
two streets over.
With or without Miguel.
Did Miguel talk to you already?
They're back.
I'm ahead of you.
I saw them drive up yesterday.
-I was there.
-Good.
What about Manas? Where is he?
Does he know about this?
I'm not absolutely sure,
but our sources told us...
What sources?
You don't tell me your name...
and I'm going to tell you
my sources?
Whatever.
Here comes this guy. Sit.
Sorry I'm late.
Now, this is what we do--
Wait, wait.
When do I whack this guy out?
When do we make this visit?
That's what
I'm going to tell you.
You will not visit
the man in the courtylard today.
Today, we'll let him settle in.
I checked the weather report.
Tomorrow,
the conditions are perfect.
So, tomorrow,
6:00 p.m. in the evening...
then we'll pay him a visit.
Wait. I'll be the one doing it.
Is that right?
I'm sorry, yes.
You will pay him a visit.
We'll be waiting in the car.
I think we should follow
on the alternate escape plan.
Which is what?
We drive to La Boca...
and then we take a boat,
and we go to Uruguay.
Port Montevideo.
This is your contact there.
From Montevideo,
we wait three days...
and then you...
you take a plane...
a private plane,
and you go to Rio de Janeiro.
OK.
Does that seem like something
that's feasible to you?
I just want to make sure...
everything sits right
about this in my head.
Focused and very clear.
That's all.
So, we meet tomorrow
at 5:15 p.m...
at Tony Manas' office.
Make it twentyl to six.
-5:40 p.m.?
-Twentyl to six.
Tomorrow, we're going to get
rid of a very, very bad person.
This country's going to be
a better country for it.
Whether the guy's rotten
should make a difference...
but it doesn't.
My job doesn't depend on
a list of character references.
My job is my job, and that's it.
Tomorrow evening,
I intend to do my job.
Any questions anybody might have
at this time? I don't.
No, I don't.
I don't have any questions.
OK, twentyl to six.
.222 with a scope.
Ciao.
Tell the Senora she'll sleep
well tomorrow night. I promise.
I'm off to Montevideo
for three days...
and then I'm coming back.
Señorita, how are you?
My aunt Maria...
-Orlando Paiva.
-Pleased to meet you.
And my sister Pirucha.
I know you. I know you.
The whole gang's here. Bravo!
-How have you been?
-I've heard about Paiva.
Absolutely.
-The great master.
-I've told him all about you.
And what about her?
The Queen!
Yes, a little.
Don't be modest.
You're being humble, aren't you?
Humble, yes.
So, what is Tango?
It's something new to me.
I love it.
Tango is life.
Tango is love, it's hate.
Tango is everything.
It's a lot of things together.
-A thing of beautyl.
-You forgot to mention love.
It's love, I did say it.
And hate.
Hey, don't interrupt me!
I'm talking.
I'm older than you are.
Yes, Tango is everything.
What is the future of Tango?
The future of Tango?
It's them.
They are the future of Tango!
It runs in the blood,
in the family.
Their blood, their family,
their training...
They were already dancing
in their mother's womb.
You gave me goose pimples.
They were being fed inside.
They're hot like their mother...
like their aunt,
and all of us women.
Watch what you're saying.
They were born dancing.
It's in the blood.
And the blood runs.
There's been so many
well-known Tango dancers.
Which were the best?
And "El Aguila Blanca."
("White Eagle")
He was a little guy. A German.
He was really tiny.
He'd spin a lot
and make lots of turns...
and suddenly
he'd lift his leg up...
and hit me right here.
But I wouldn't stop,
I'd just go on.
I liked dancing with him,
but it hurt.
It was just a stylle of dancing.
It was his stylle.
An aggressive stylle, wasn't it?
Maybe it's that he was tiny,
and I was taller...
so he'd kick me
right you know where.
I'd dance with guys
who came from work...
with dirtyl collars
and spotted suits.
But I didn't care because
all I wanted was to dance...
not to go out with them.
Excuse me. What are the right
moves for a "Figure Eight"?
When someone
from one neighborhood...
danced really well...
and came
to our neighborhood club...
we'd fight it out
on the dance floor...
cleaning up the floor
with each other.
They also fought on the streets
every Saturday and Sunday night.
Did you fight?
Yes, when I had a boyfriend,
I used to fight for him.
We'd pull each other's hair.
We women used to grab
each other's hair.
We were kinda tough back then.
We'd fight for the man we loved.
No, you're not getting it.
You should lead me.
You lead me.
No, not like that.
Just follow me.
What's the story
about Carlos Gardel...
and his plane crash?
The last Tango was called,
what was it? "Adiós Muchachos."
Oh, no! Don't say that!
Grab yourself where it counts!
That's a no-no for Argentines.
It's very bad. Grab your nuts.
You shouldn't say those words.
It's a no-no in Tango.
You see he's grabbing...
"Adiós Muchachos."
No! I'm going to smack him.
He's doing it on purpose.
He's making me nervous,
and I'm losing my shawl.
Maria, care to dance?
Of course. Excuse me.
A salon Tango
has a different feeling.
At least that's how I feel.
When I dance salon Tango,
I feel transported, like flying.
When I'm performing,
I have to worry about...
getting stepped on or kicked...
but salon Tango is simply
a feeling between two.
A man and a woman.
She loves dancing.
Both of them.
Different stylles.
Look at that.
Very clean.
Let's make a toast.
For friendship, whiskey,
cigarettes...
and to my one true love,
the Tango.
May I dance Tango until I die.
What a night.
I got something for you,
very special...
that I want you to share
with your loved ones.
This means a lot for me
and to me...
-It's the future of tango.
-The future of tango.
You're welcome.
I have to practice my Tango.
I have to walk every day, OK?
Right, but
you're a bit bow-legged.
So I will show you an exercise.
You should put this coin
between your knees.
Hold it tight.
You walk kind of like this.
Walk. Walk.
Very good, very good.
Manuela, Manuela.
We'll meet you tomorrow,
3:30, in the plaza.
-I have a surprise.
-A surprise?
I have a business meeting
at twentyl to six...
and a plane to catch after that,
so don't be late.
Take care.
Remember, my friends...
"Adiós Muchachos."
You have one drink...
you think the whole neighborhood
is following you.
-Miguel.
-You followed him to the hotel?
Yes, all the way. We'll be
waiting for him in his room.
It's finished.
Here's your coffee, sir.
Today is a special day.
No, it's just another day.
-Flowers.
-Yes?
-What's your name?
-José.
Good-bye, José.
Good morning, sir.
I have to deliver
these flowers to you.
Flowers? Who are they from?
From your old friends, the boys.
-Who are you?
-Me?
-Yes, who are you?
-I'm nobody.
José doesn't exist.
Adiós, motherfucker.
What is it? What happened?
Nothing...nothing.
A heart attack.
What?
Madam! Help! Madam!
What is it?
What's wrong with him?
What's happened?
What's happened to him?
Done.
I can go home now. Yeah.
Go home to my family.
I thought they'd do it tonight.
I'm also surprised.
I don't know
what the fuck happened.
The Gringo went crazy.
What happened?
Tell me what happened?
Don't tell them anything!
We'd better not speak
for a while.
I'll call you
if I find anything out.
I don't think
you'll find anything.
I'm also working on it.
Go ahead. But if anything
goes wrong, you'll pay.
We'll be in touch. Bye.
Cops.
We're at the scene
with the housekeeper...
who found the body.
Madam, you are the General's
housekeeper, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
You were there during the crime
and found the body.
Exactly. I saw blood.
And there was a wound
straight to his heart.
What was the gunman saying?
He seemed
to be really out of it.
He looked very strange.
Had the General received
any death threats recently?
Was he afraid?
Honestly, I couldn't say.
Are you frightened now?
Yes, because the man saw me.
I'm listening to it right now.
I guess the guy was important.
Must have been real important.
Geez, I hope I can get my guy
out of the country...
you know what I mean?
Hey, take it easy.
Wait a minute.
I didn't send you
a second-rate wiseguy.
I sent you the best I know of
anywheres...
and if he hit the guy early...
he must have had
a pretty good reason.
Look at me when I'm talking,
you shit!
I want to know what
Orlando's involvement is.
I want to know about his family.
About the money.
I want to know his contacts.
Who's paying you?
Sir, I'm in charge
of this case now.
I'm Chief of Police...
I know perfectly well
who you are.
But this is not police business.
You are out
of Federal jurisdiction.
I want to be alone
with the prisoner.
Everybody out! Go!
Gentlemen!
I don't have all day!
What the fuck
happened with you people?
Why did you take so long?
Take it easy, Miguel.
You know how these things are.
-Excuse me.
-Come in.
Miss...tell me about
Charles Edward.
Charles Edward?
I don't know who he is.
He spent the night with you.
The American.
The American. Good.
I don't know what to tell you.
I didn't learn his name.
Can you help me
with any information?
I met him.
He took me to a hotel.
I spent the night with him.
And what did he say to you?
You must be able
to give me some information?
He wanted me
to call him "Daddy."
"Daddy"?
"Daddy."
And tell me, is he your Daddy?
What do you mean?
Whatever.
And you don't know his name.
Yes. He was my Daddy.
Frankie, listen to me.
I had to do it this way.
Don't ask me why,
but it's very clear in my mind.
Otherwise, I'd have
circled the drain by now.
Where's the leak?
Do you have any idea?
None. All I know is
I'm on my own except for Manas.
I don't know what happened
to Miguel or Orlando.
But it's been on TV...
and I'm in some kind of
predicament down here.
Anyway, only trust Manas.
He's the only one.
How do I trust him
if I can't find him?
Keep trying, that's all.
Maybe I should go
to the racetrack and ask around.
That's not a good idea.
Stay in your room and
go out only when you have to.
Even then,
it's not a good idea.
Only go out
when you got to call Manas.
What if I can't get him,
Frankie?
Then you have to just go for it.
No matter what happens,
use the dummy passport.
Otherwise, you'll be
in a lot of trouble.
OK. I got to get off the phone
and get a hold of this guy.
Wait a minute.
I don't believe this.
What?
I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.
Holy shit. Oh, my God.
What is it?
It's a dream. Sleep!
What were you
going to do with this?
You fuck!
Sleep!
This never happened.
Damn it!
Hello! Hello!
Get me the fire department!
I mean, the police!
Urgent! Urgent!
You stupid bastard. You could
have bought another pair.
But better late than never.
The song me and my brother used
to sing when we were kids.
Happy Birthday, Jenny,
this is your day of the year
Happy Birthday, Jenny
We bring you
health and good cheer
Remember, darling,
stay as young as you can
The part I like--
When you reach ninetyl-four
May you have ninetyl more
And waltz your birthday waltz
I may never see you again, kid,
but I'm going to try.
I mean, where are
they going to send the body?
Jenny. OK.
I'm resting for a minute
'cause my room's bugged.
Whole fucking world is bugged.
It was a close call. Too close.
Stupid bastard.
Mister. Come here a moment.
I want to show you something.
I wanted to show you my mama.
She's an old lady. Poor thing...
I'm taking care of her.
She's sleeping.
Very good, yes.
Are you in a hurry?
Don't use that door.
Use that one, it's better.
-I'm going to Montevideo, OK?
-OK.
-I'll be back.
-Fine, this is your house.
Three days, yes, thank you.
Sir, could you
please step out a minute?
Do what?
Documents.
I need to see your passport.
Who the fuck are you?
Doesn't matter who I am.
Can you step out, please?
-In a minute!
-Hurry up!
Let me finish.
It's a little embarrassing.
I need to see
your documents, sir.
If you shake it more than once,
you're playing with it.
-Come on!
-Hold on.
Motherfucker!
Here we go.
Sir, we have arrived.
Give me a light, will you?
I've been lightin' your cigars
for fifteen years.
You'd think by now
you'd have your own lighter.
I don't like to carry a lighter.
You know that.
I know. That's why
I carry it for you.
That's why I have you around.
What do you think
I got you around for?
-You're on payroll, right?
-Simple reason.
The flight's on time, boss,
or what's up?
What happened?
Are you all right?
You fuck, you.
You almost caused
a third world war down there.
What happened?
You tell me. But I'm gonna
tell you guys something.
Somebody knew something
from the beginning...
from the very beginning.
No way. It was airtight.
-Come on, get in here with me.
-Wait.
Come over here.
Bend down and kiss the ground
for me over here.
-Kiss what?
-Wait, wait, wait.
I'm too stiff, so just bend down
and kiss the ground for me.
It's good to be home.
Kiss the ground?
Kiss my ass, you fuckin'--
Listen to this guy.
You fuckin' guys'll
never change.
Let's go, guys. Let's go.
All right, come on.
Get in the car.
I even brought my dogs
here to see us.
You ought to see some of
those bastards dance down there.
You never saw anything like it.
If the boat had gone
the other way...
we'd all be doing the tango.
-Tell me about it, huh?
-Yeah, yeah.
What's the matter, puppy?
Why don't you get a rottweiler?
Get a Doberman.
Get a police dog or something.
My wife would throw me
out of the house.
She loves you, right?
How are Maggie and Jen doing?
All right?
Yeah, they're doin' good.
When are you gonna marry Maggie?
You keep an eye on that kid.
You're always worried
about Maggie. So get married.
Since when are you
worried about me?
-Stop this shit and get married.
-We'll see, we'll see.
I want you to show me
which one is your boyfriend.
Come on, I've been waiting
all this time. Come on, show me.
It's this one.
The one with the red hat.
-Oh, he's cute.
-No, no.
What about this big guy
with the blue hat?
Good to see you.
You missed my birthday,
and you got an ugly haircut!
I got an ugly haircut?
What do you mean?
I'm beautiful.
What are you talkin' about?
Good to see you.
Happy to see me?
Yeah.
Good to see you.
I got a present for you at home.
Cool!
Cool?
A special present for you. I do.
You missed my birthday.
-I'm not so cool anymore, am l?
-No.
Step out to the side.
Now step back left.
Step back right
and cross your feet. Whoops.
And in like that. Very good.
She's a quick learner.
It's about as much as I know.
It's so beautiful.
Where'd you learn that?
Where'd I learn it? Guatemala.
What do they call that dance?
They call it the...
tango-fandango whatever.
You look good at that.
The last one in the house
does not get a present.
Oh, I'm going.
The last one in the house
does not get a present.
But where's the key.
Do you have my key?
-Yeah.
-Honey, where's your key?
The last one in the house
does not get a present.
I want my present, too.
OK, hurry, hurry.
You go.
No, you get out of here.
You get out of here.
They're beautiful, Johnny!
I love them!
They're beautiful!
Dear John...
here's a video
of a 21st century tango.
Practice the steps
that I taught you...
so if you ever come back
to Buenos Aires, we can dance.
And remember, you're never,
never too old to learn.
Your friend, Manuela.
