Amanda!
Thank you, Benny!
Thanks,
I wish you a nice day.
Hi, T.J. Hi, Molly.
Hi Amanda
How was your week?
Quiet, but it will be busier ..
What can you recommend me?
The blackberries are delicious ...
Actually, I would like one pound
like raspberry.
Thank you.
Good morning, Abe.
Welcome back Charlie.
Thank you, oh and I'm sorry
that you have to close.
- Pardon?
- Do you know what to do?
What are you hitting me now?
It is quiet but
we're not close.
He is confused ...
I have some
delicious shiitake mushrooms for you.
Where are all the portobellos?
They are all on.
Valderon wanted them all.
Finally, you've seen him.
I've never heard of him.
I'm not talking about Valderon,
other ...
What ...
I have you in my
never seen here.
Are you here more often?
Only if absolutely
necessary ...
It's a long journey.
These are for you.
Peekytoes. Fantastic.
I do not know how I
to prepare a crab.
Thanks anyway.
Bye.
I saw you just not there?
It is important to remember that
when one door closes ..
... There is another door open.
Take my scratching it, Amanda.
Your mother would like to see
that everything in the cupboard.
My mother is deceased.
That is no reason
to ignore it.
Put your nose open.
What a nasty man.
Well, that's $ 59.
Oh, let it get away!
I got you!
Hi ...
I'm sorry, but there can be any
when something crawling in your pants.
You probably think that I am a
some idiot ...
But I just tried
help.
- Jezum!
- Sorry.
- Lively guy, right?
- Not for long
It is lunch dish in my restaurant.
Really?
Yes, I um .. something.
Uhm .. something very ... um ...
Napoleon.
Crab napoleon, actually.
Would be very tasty.
I like that belief.
You seem not really the type of restaurant.
- No? Why not?
- You Pack.
- If you do that?
- Well, actually.
I open a restaurant soon.
And I happen to like my
Chef overlooked.
And I think you've lost your crab.
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.
Good luck.
You too.
I got your runaway friend found.
You should not just leave your stuff.
Thanks. Oh my gosh.
Why did I buy this?
I'm Gene O'Reilly.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, you change!
Hey there.
I got some coffee for you.
Thank you.
Au, what are these heavy.
What are you doing that?
Tell me some other time.
I had the weirdest morning.
First I met a man
O'Reilly called Gene
- He said he was a friend of my mother.
- You know him?
Gene O'Reilly?
No, I do not know.
I remember that name.
I think he was a little crazy.
And when Charlie asked me how I felt
about closing the restaurant.
He is back?
Has he asked you out?
Tia Stella, do not change now
the subject.
We agreed that we
restaurant would run together.
Okay then.
The new landlord raised the rent.
We do not save the honey,
been a while.
By how much has he raised the rent.
With 3000 euros per month.
- 3000 euro? He can not just do it.
- He did anyway.
Then we will have a bank
for a loan, right?
I already tried.
And as it is,
the bank has no confidence that we
the ability to pay back.
But we have been here for 70 years.
- Sorry.
- No, excuse me.
No, it's my fault.
Come on, what's that phrase again?
"If God closes one door, he opens a window"
- What?
- Did I wrong?
I'm not very good with expressions,
you know that?
Come, then we eat.
I am dying of hunger.
Since Henri Bendel first
opened in New York
we're known as the
most elegant store for women.
Jonathan Henry's grandson,
there are now more more
by April 1 star restaurant in
a department store to open.
After an exclusive dinner at Jonathan's,
Our guests continue shopping.
It's a whole new combination
of special dining and shopping.
That will see you next week.
Thanks for your visit.
Excuse me, but I've heard you
Spent 2.5 million euros
to a restaurant with 75 seats.
That's a big gamble.
Well madam, if it's not a gamble
You have the right ingredients.
Thanks again.
- Tom?
- Yes?
A very thin girl is waiting in your office
Oh no, that's Chris.
Lois, what does it alone in my office?
I do not know, but I
offered her a sandwich.
With butter and jam.
Chris.
I just uploaded my calendar on your PC.
I hope you use a condom.
- What?
- Oh, nothing.
I see you at lunch.
- Lunch ...
- Goodbye
Oh my gosh.
She has done it in red.
Share your cyberspace ...
That is a bigger step for you, Tom.
I really wanted the part
during lunch.
- We went out three times.
- Is it too heavy for you?
No, but I just know
exactly how this goes.
Look at this.
This is happiness plotted against time.
You put this out?
Yes, you see that after the third date
happiness decreases very fast?
This is because everyone
in the beginning is different.
No one expects that something happened.
On the fourth date is a relationship
with obligations and expectations.
Look well, we went out three times
and she uploads her agenda.
Then they begin to wonder:
"When will he marry me?"
"How will our kids look like?"
And I start thinking:
"Should I really be with her every weekend?"
"And she must have suspected when I work?"
And it becomes a vicious circle
of arguments and then make up.
While at first just ...
fun.
I think you forget something.
The information you need, Tom
what you do after the third date
ensuring that everyone
so unhappy.
What I do?
No, no. Do not touch that.
Once set down.
I'm starting to worry
about your obsession with airplanes.
In 1961, Howard Hughes flew
a paper vliegtuigtje
The Gold Nugget to the Sands.
That was 7 km.
Once I break that record.
It's all in the adjustments
of the wings.
Just look.
Howard Hughes was not that guy
who always wore his pajamas?
No, that is Hugh Hefner.
John Starks is really great.
He pitched well last night ridiculed.
Okay, shut up. Come here.
Taste.
- It's good.
- You know you can not lie?
It stinks.
It tastes like blue cheese and compost.
There is only one thing that tastes like dirty ...
Rum and raisins.
I regret that we must close.
We can probably at a
start another restaurant.
Sure, we can place an ad.
If we could afford ...
"Lousy chef and sous-chef
Search restaurant to ruin. "
Lousy boss and sjou ..
Oh, really important.
We need a miracle.
Please.
Do you want a desert today?
I may not, I have today
got results of my cholesterol test.
You want to know.
All I can say is,
Howie no more desserts.
I know ...
Hi everyone.
Good news.
The bodega on the corner is gone.
I've never liked that guy anyway.
We at least have a place for lunch.
Uhm ... actually ...
I want to tell you something.
I can not believe this.
We never get this time a taxi.
Put that phone away!
This is horrible, I do not understand.
I do not like it.
This is horrible, what should I have lunch?
Bill, you eat our food anyway.
I love your cheesy chicken.
Howard, be honest.
You come here not for eating.
Do not give up, not so fast.
- You will establish better.
- We love you, Amanda.
I love you.
You are very loyal, friendly people.
You deserve a 'Southern Cross' as before,
when my mother was still here.
I've tried,
but I am not my mother.
I'm sorry.
I have lots of experience. Just do it simply!
I'll wait until Thursday, I want a bell.
Thank you. No, not you.
Excuse me. Where are we?
This is not Chanterelles.
Should I do anything for you?
Excuse me, you're a taxi driver ...
Oh darling, it's that way.
Honey?
Hey you!?
Oh my goodness ...
Not now ...
Perfect, a local resident.
Do you know where ..?
Hey ...
Know each other?
Her crab has bitten me this morning.
Is that so?
Do you know where this restaurant is?
Chanterelles?
- Sure, two streets that way.
- No, no, no ...
We are here now, then
we might as well eat.
Moreover, I do feel like crab ...
I do want the one that is so honest.
Um, actually, the lunch time is over ...
Forever ...
- So you were just to tease me?
- What?
This morning the market ...
The crab napoleon and the souffle?
It sounded great.
Thank you.
Do you have a menu we can see?
Of course.
What makes a humiliation?
Follow me ...
Two new customers ...
Maybe it's a sign?
Oh my god ...
- He is here.
- Who?
The man of the market.
I told him that I crab napoleon
could make the pommes something.
And now he's here.
Just say to him,
that it is.
No, tell him that we close.
- I can not do.
- Then I do it.
No! Then he leaves.
That is the purpose?
No! I want him to stay.
Then we should just scratch that ...
- Neopool ... napalm ...
- Napoleon.
If you say so.
Help.
You better
a search of your mother's recipes.
Okay, but then I look forward ...
Crab napoleon.
This is disgusting ...
But if they ever will find inspiration ...
please let it happen ...
- Hey, you have a recipe?
- Oh, no ...
But I have found this
in my mother's casket.
They're beautiful.
Hey, maybe we can sell
to pay the rent.
Nolan, these have been my mother ...
- So, the crabs ... I cook them?
- Yeah, go ahead.
How did you hear about us?
Sorry it took so long.
In a few minutes it's ready.
Wish you both the crab?
No.
I was wondering if you just
a simple Chicken Paillard to make?
A Chicken Paillard for Mrs Beanstalk.
I am really link from such types.
- She is perfect for him.
- That she is not at all.
Look at that hair.
Each tuft in the right place,
just like his.
I can do my hair nicely.
Not like that, Amanda.
So what, she has perfect hair.
It's not just the hair, it is also the skin.
She has such a silky ...
like butter ...
It's called makeup, Nolan,
and if you help me.
You must be born with a skin.
And you see that suit.
That is so tightly that they can spring back out.
- And you see those shoes!
- Nolan! Shut up!
You're wrong.
He is not happy with her.
He would not be happy
someone with perfect skin and perfect hair
and clothing with perfect
damn matching shoes.
And if you can not see, that's pathetic.
She will inevitably once the basket.
Today I'm just a little stressed.
But I can handle it.
If you say so ...
Okay, now ..
we make the best crab napoleon.
Where is the recipe?
I told you I could not find it?
We're going to improvise.
Bring me everything we have.
Everything we have? ...
And the crab is cooked?
The crabs ...
... His death.
There's nobody here.
It is also very late for lunch.
It's so ... 'Cleveland'.
Are you interested in a martini?
No thanks, I do not.
No thank you.
You know, this once
I would like to make something fantastic.
All this comes together perfectly, in such
a way that you bite into ecstasy.
Have you ever noticed,
how many words are there for good?
Blessed
Tasty
Appetizing
Delicieus
Delightful
Drooling
Uh ... Nolan?
Bizarre ...
The people we do not know
want their food.
Where does that come?
I have no idea ...
Beautiful ...
You know, Chris.
I've lately been thinking a lot about us.
So do I.
- We have a lot more intimate.
- Is that so?
By joining our calendars and stuff.
I always know where you are.
Oh my god.
Do you think he like it?
Okay?
I think so.
You're such a dominant asshole.
What?
I'm sorry.
I do not know why I said that.
Neither do I.
You should really try it.
It is delicious.
- Tommy?
- It is absolutely wonderful.
Tommy?
I do not understand them.
What do I do with someone like you?
I mean .... I? With my perfect hair.
What is she doing?
I hate this restaurant.
What are you doing?
My apologies ...
I have perfect skin.
Perfect.
- I think she swallowed something ...
- Your food.
I've decided that you're a waste
my perfect dress
with matching shoes.
No one is so perfect.
I do.
And if you do not see ...
I find it sad for you.
Excuse me.
Watch this now ...
These signs do not fit together.
No, Chris ...
I love this jacket.
He is beautiful.
Adios.
Thank you.
You okay people?
She has a nice mood.
Not normally, it will be the curse
the fourth date.
Just one of my theories.
I'm very sorry,
I will replace signs.
What was this? My name is also Tom.
Dill?
- Tom Dill?
- Tom Bartlett. Do you use dill?
- If the peer?
- Send me the bill.
- It rhymes with insurance.
- Yes
I will do.
That was very nice.
I can not believe that happened. Very bizarre.
I'm sorry. I've already told you?
I really gotta go, I believe.
Here's my card.
If you call me, I will replace signs.
The meal ....
What's your name?
Amanda.
Shelton.
What happened to you?
I have had the most wonderful lunch.
Too bad nothing has come out of your mouth.
Oh no, that's Chris's Lunch
She took the not so best.
She went totally crazy.
And then she dumped me. Would normally
I do get upset ...
If I do not that amazing
things had eaten crab.
I felt ...
But you wanted to dump her anyway?
No, Louis. I have feelings.
They treated me like I was nothing.
I do not know if they liked me at all.
Maybe ... She
I just used.
That's just awful.
I want to talk to the counselors when the meeting ends.
Wait! How do I look?
Come on, Louis. It was two years ago.
Jonathan is not interested.
You should really go.
I can not help it.
I just love him.
What do you see that I'm missing?
They are his hands.
It makes me crazy.
I want them over my body.
Come on, help me now.
Every man has a weakness.
What of him?
Jonathan who?
Das easy immortality.
His, not his grandfather.
That's what he wants.
Immortality?
- Thank you also come.
- Sorry I'm late.
Tom, will you tell me why you
Have $ 80,000 spent
on a floor where I dizzy?
It does not even look like a restaurant.
Anything from a musical Ticketline.
Exactly, it's a stage for a fantasy
and floor, the atmosphere.
Like a crab that can ...
Jonathan's, the best restaurant
in New York.
It will 'Jonathan's' are.
We want it is excessive.
And sometimes you need something for that to continue,
for the extra dill .. U.S. dollars.
I do not sound very comfortable.
Have I ever let you down?
Not yet. But you're still young.
Very young.
Remember, because Jonathan's
in seven stores is
Jonathan's will be everywhere.
Royalties to come, articles about you
in Vanity Fair, the Times.
Not about Henry, but about YOU.
You will be immortal.
I like you do, Louis.
You're just a like a guy
you think with your balls.
Thank you, Jonathan.
Okay, let's move on.
Let me fall catalog.
I think finally the floor is clean.
I found this fragment between the seats.
Nolan, what do you think?
Looks delicious.
What is it?
Amanda, I do not think so ...
Let's look for the sugar cookies.
Well thanks for the trust.
Go anyway.
She did.
Something strange is happening here.
Amanda!
I am above, Nolan.
I'm here.
And stay away from the dolls.
What about this?
What?
Signs now.
In the center.
Just back.
Tom offered to new
signs for us now.
It would be rude if I refuse.
We should have signs.
I think that crazy chick from last
three boards has left.
For Ruth, and Bill Howard.
Three, so we are done.
- How about this?
- No.
If I am there,
what should I say to him?
You saw him and you know me and
You know how I can rattle when I get nervous.
And I know that I will be nervous.
Amanda, relax. Just be yourself.
- No say, please.
- See?
So here I am afraid.
Nolan Come, help me now.
You're a man.
Where are men interested in?
Sex.
I can not talk about.
Otherwise, there are sports cars and money ...
No, we only think about sex.
That can not be beat. There must be something
otherwise we can talk about.
I saw it still on Dateline.
The average male thinks about sex 238x per day.
That means they
the whole day thinking about sex.
Pretty much it ...
Perhaps it refers to you.
Pretty much it ...
You know when men
their seat belts do?
Say nothing more please.
Stop, I do not listen.
So they think of.
See for yourself.
Why did you tell me this?
Every time a guy does,
I think of this. Forever.
Thank you.
You said it yourself ...
- I gotta go.
- Wait.
Really?
Yes, yes, but who do.
- Ramos
- Tom.
What is it?
The round must come first.
The square below.
You see it.
Not adjust.
Only admire.
That is wonderful.
Well done man!
Thank you.
What would I do without you?
Pardon?
You know where I can find Tom Bartlett?
Yes, he was just here.
There tie.
Thank you.
I verschuldigt you.
No, I will just
latter suits and then ...
Please let lie.
No, sorry.
If you allow me ...
Sorry.
Please, please let me ...
Hey.
Ramos can do.
Ask Laura but to help you.
Thank you.
I believe we are now quite.
Yes, I believe.
I'm really sorry.
Oh no, it's a nice coincidence.
- Do you come here often shop?
- I? No.
Never really.
I thought you said that the signs
wanted to replace.
Right? Why I'm here.
Sure, but I thought you would send the bill.
Sell you no plates?
Yes, the dishes on the fourth floor.
Do all these elevators to the fourth?
Pick one and press four.
Of course.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Sorry.
- Do not worry.
There is a beautiful new series from Italy ...
- It's really beautiful.
- What?
He is right on the top shelf ...
I can not hear you.
Ok, I'll let you see it here.
Four ...
Will not clash with the colors in your restaurant?
Oh, I can not afford it anyway.
I'm really sorry yesterday.
Forget it dude.
Happens quite often.
Is everything okay with your girlfriend?
I think so.
Yes it is fine.
She's just not my girlfriend.
- Sorry.
- Oh no dude. It was already time.
Did you have long been out together?
No, not really.
Actually I have no idea
why she reacted.
Normally they are so ...
subdued and quiet.
She was very strange.
- Have you done anything to provoke her?
- No.
Did you do that?
Ok, I'd like eight plates from that table.
And this here.
And such signs on the shelf.
Eight of each?
Is that too much?
I can take less.
No, no, no that's fine.
Helen wants you just write down each of eight
the Susan, the Orange and Lily.
And I will sign here if you give me the bill.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Thank you.
I'll make sure you get this morning.
Thank you.
Very bold choice, if I may say so.
Explains your clothes.
For there to choose the right chain,
had lasted half hour longer.
- Aha.
- It seems like you do not have long.
Touche, I'll pack is completely out of the shower.
- And with a belt.
- I really do not wear belts.
- Really?
- Yes, why?
Not important.
Not important?
No, no, wait a minute.
What do you mean?
How long have you worked here?
Three years.
But you can not ask something strange
and not tell me,
why you want to know.
I do not really know why ...
I knew this would happen ...
My friend, Nolan, told me
about men and sex.
About that a balance of about 238x a day to remember
and then they play with their belt.
That is ridiculous.
No, no, no not the belt.
I was not thinking ...
No, I thought of the amount ...
I do the math ...
I might
seventeen hours a day.
That turns 60.
That would ...
1020:238 ...
That would be every four minutes.
Yes, that's right about it.
I've been here for about 20 minutes ...
Right ...
It is impossible.
Why?
What is impossible?
Because a good idea sensual
at least 20 minutes.
Is that so?
Pardon?
Mr. Bartlett?
Your secretary just called
Wilkinson has started the discussion.
Yes, 20 minutes ago.
Thank you.
- I would really have to work again.
- Me too.
I'll walk with you to the elevator.
That's an interesting folding wing.
How come you so much
know about paper airplanes?
I hated math.
Of course ...
Tie flies?
Yes, yes.
But not where I want him going.
Now I focus for example on the bucket.
He does not fly very well.
But he flies with a purpose.
- Ramos, that looks beautiful.
- Thank you.
I'm glad you stopped by.
So do I.
And you have not told me yet,
what happens in your Crab Napoleon Sat
Oh I almost forgot that.
There was a dessert with your lunch.
- Desert?
- I love desserts.
That's the whole purpose of a meal.
Wonderful, Graham.
Wow, this ...
Does it taste?
This is ...
This is really very good.
This is really very tasty.
Have you already met Brian?
Brian works at the shoe department.
Nice to meet you.
Pleasant.
I love shoes.
Me too, Mr. Bartlett.
I love the fact that we sell shoes.
And this in pairs.
It's so ... Noah's Ark.
Thank you Brian.
Other plan.
- Are you okay?
- Fine.
Where are we going?
You will love it.
I feel a little strange.
This is ... You're a chef.
You will love it.
Many people can make
but only God can create truffles.
What does he do?
He is a bit mad.
Ok, let him alone.
And this is the actual restaurant.
It is very beautiful.
That will certainly be.
But these are really great.
As it starts in your mouth and
go to your head increases.
How then runs along your spine and
explodes out of your toes.
Am I interrupting?
Hello?
Bartlett?
Bartlett?
Wilkinson's group to the restaurant.
What are you doing? Clerks
the interview? Come on.
One moment.
I'm sorry, but I really should go.
I'll just walk with you to the exit.
Does not hear.
I can probably find him.
This was great fun.
Right?
This means that it is probably
next time can be fun.
Logically.
I'll call you.
Really?
Of course I will do that.
It's more fun to throw paper airplanes,
than one set to meet bankers.
I wish I had thought it.
I can not believe I forgot.
I'm really distracted by the restaurant.
Well you about begins.
I had a dream where I wanted to tell you about.
I wore a suit.
I could see the reflection of my
grandfathers face in my shoes look.
The restaurant was opened.
I had a great time.
That's great ...
But ....
Every time I looked down ...
... In my shoes ...
... Henry stuck his tongue out at me.
Why do you think he did?
I really do not know, Jonathan.
It concerns me ...
I want you to continue thinking about it.
I will do so.
He said he would call.
What do you think he meant?
Today? Or tomorrow?
Next week? ...
We must have someone there.
Estelle can not do it alone.
I can not all
at the same time make.
Hey, you want customers ...
Now you have them.
There's a juicy story about about you.
I'll try of course
the clamp down.
Thank you.
Do not you know what's going on?
Well, I'll tell you.
It is about you and a girl.
Caught red-handed in the restaurant.
In flagrante?
We were dancing.
Dancing? Oops, better.
That is so romantic.
I think we were dancing ...
It was all very strange.
I was not really myself.
I felt like I was a different person.
A romantic person ...
How nice for you.
But I was definitely not myself.
I'm sure this is blown off.
He rejoins the perfect girl.
Amanda, if you start over one more time
then chop my ears off and send them to him.
Call him up.
No, I can not.
I've never called a man.
Then they get into a panic.
What are you doing?
Please, do not.
Bendell's department store please.
- It was very strange.
- What was her name?
- Amanda Sh ...
- Amanda Shelton on one line, Tom.
That's scary.
- Hello?
- Hey Tom. I'm Amanda.
I just want to ... food?
Uhm .. you invite to dinner here.
Tonight?
I'll just check my calendar.
I have a meeting,
who for eight hours tonight.
Nope.
Ok ...
um ...
I'm here until late at night,
if you still want to pass here.
Sure, if it is not too late.
Ok, maybe I'll see you
once.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Thank you, Nolan.
You've been a naughty little man.
Very naughty.
That guy who can not come tonight.
Maybe another time.
Are you the cook?
No sir I'm the sous-chef.
Why? Is something wrong?
Are you kidding?
This food is fantastic.
I even like the same meal again.
Are you sure sir?
Yes!
But this time I first desert
and then the other dishes.
Ok, but if you continue
we need you later towed away.
We served 100 dinners.
I do not know what's going on with you,
but the food is fantastic.
Thank you.
Fear is a good motivation.
I do not think it is fear.
Whatever it is,
it is a cause for celebration.
Let's go dancing!
I think you tonight
alone will have to dance.
- You sure?
- Yes.
I'm sure.
I do not think he comes along, Amanda.
I can not wait.
There's magic in the air, Amanda.
Hey there.
Hey.
It's very late.
Yes, I was very busy ...
Yes, I was very busy.
There was a group of six persons,
who did not want to go.
I had to finally
send away at midnight.
Fortunately, because I thought
I miss you would run.
You must be broken.
Yeah, those guys going.
I have brought you this.
- It's ...
- Vanilla orchids.
I almost never see this.
- What?
- How you smell the flowers.
- Can I walk with you home?
- Of course.
Thank you.
Is it here?
All my life.
- Thank you for the flowers.
- My pleasure.
This is the point we just do
like we have been eating
And wish each other good night?
We can do that.
But are we had a desert?
I'm still hungry.
If you know another thing that is open,
I would like to eat a dessert.
Ok.
Ok?
What was your meeting?
I lied to you ...
There was no meeting ...
I do not know
why I tell you this.
I guess because I regret.
Never mind.
I get it.
My last table was about 11 hours away.
- Okay, then.
- So I'm sorry too.
Now I feel really silly.
Not doing dude.
Otherwise I feel lousy again.
I feel bad again,
because I have you twice lousy feeling.
I think we both regret.
We both regret.
That smell ...
This is vanilla with flowers.
Unbelievable.
The taste ...
... is so good.
It's fantastic.
Sweet and slightly spicy.
- Ramos
- Oh Tom, I was looking up already
These orchids ...
where we have more of it.
I want them all to the party.
Ok, but we've bought roses 2000 ...
It does not matter.
I want everything to smell vanilla.
But there is a problem ...
Valderon does not work.
- He does not ...
- What? Why?
Air France has lost his knife.
Ramos, give him a new knife.
He does not want new, he wants his own.
Ramos, nobody gets out to knives.
Give him blades, no matter what.
The rule.
I'm impressed, Mr. Bartlett.
The design is fantastic.
But I must say
I am skeptical.
The building cost more than estimated
and Valderon is a difficult man.
He sure is, but ...
Report on the cost ...
many of them are some expenses.
Like a delicious design ...
Watering and market ...
Ads and tasty ...
My apologies ...
- Are you eating?
- Oh no.
- It is this new odor.
- No, no.
I think it is ...
Amanda has not told us
it's so expensive.
Pardon?
Pardon?
- Do you eat with you?
- Yes, but ...
I'm sorry but I must take.
A new store policy ...
You may not bring food ...
because the rats.
Thank you.
I told you here
Shopping dangerous.
You must learn to share, Tom.
This is delicious.
Actually this is fantastic.
- Need more?
- No?
- You sure?
- Certainly.
This is excellent ...
I wish that Jonathan was here ...
Where did you get this?!
My goodness!
I have a 75 year old omatje
robbed this.
Louis, I'm really going crazy ..
I can not help but think of her.
We kissed ...
... In a cloud of vanilla ...
Vanilla, right?
She's amazing, this girl.
She is beautiful, she's smart, she's funny.
And she can cook!
Louis, in a way she can cook
you are crazy.
It's crazy, Louis.
It's very fast ...
This is only our second date.
Or not?
Previously our third date ...
It feels like a lifetime
of great dates.
And they created a fog, Louis.
It was warm and wet ...
And it was just
or you could see what we felt.
This is Tom.
You can now better run.
You do not have time for.
I know Louis.
Look at me, I eat cake.
I never eat desserts.
You're dead.
She has you in its power.
Whatever you do,
does not go to her.
No, absolutely not.
I can not.
But I must
actually tell her in person ...
No, do not.
Too dangerous, use the telephone.
No, Louis.
I do this more often.
- I can handle this.
- Not this time!
- Do you think I can not handle it.
- I do not know, I know.
Louis, trust me now.
I'm going after work to her
and I sit quietly. I eat anything.
Everything is on its feet.
Just wait.
I can not wait.
Sorry that I am waiting.
Annie ...
Can you do for me as soon as possible
the 'Southern Cross'
as many
caramel eclair things get?
Please hurry.
- Come ...
- Normally ...
Oh my gosh!
Oh, Jonathan.
Amanda, we have a guest.
I did not expect you here tonight.
Amanda, can I talk to you?
Sure, but it is now equally bad.
Will soon be well?
Yes of course.
Is it okay if I
give a few signs?
Oh, wait!
The mussels are ready.
Please.
One more, here.
What were you talking about?
You're a great cook.
Until last week, I could cook anything.
I can not believe that.
I tried it,
but it just never tasted.
Suddenly it worked.
That is many things.
Like when you learn cycling.
The first nine times you fall off your bike
and the tenth time you drive one kilometer away.
I think ...
Since I fancy.
A crab salad.
I do not think he is a typical crab.
He is a little strange.
- How about a dessert?
- Fine.
This is an a
very good knife.
Tion was not so good past.
I can enjoy a
nice aerodynamic phenomenon.
As with your paper airplane.
That was an airflow from the air.
- And the band?
- He was indeed right?
The band was a
hallucination of the eclairs.
Our high sugar levels.
And we both had the same happen?
No, there is something strange going on
and I can not explain it.
I'm getting a little scared.
No, we should also feel.
A little light in our heads
and distracted.
But our senses are sharpened.
A kind of deja vu.
It is very lively.
It is even very lively.
But it's not real.
That's very good.
Amanda, you're just
become a great cook.
It's not magic.
It's talent.
Pure and simple.
Thank you.
What was I thinking not.
I love to kiss you.
I love you.
So what happens?
We float!
Stop this!
- This is fantastic.
- This is fantastic! It's scary.
Why not go down?
Touch not panic now.
I'm not panicking, Amanda!
I'm stuck.
This is your fault, so help me ...
... Please? ...
I've done nothing!
You are responsible here
for do not you think?
Think of something! Please!
Of course the magic word ...
Do you hear it?
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo ...
That's not funny!
- I better go.
- Why?
I'm going to kiss you and ...
- I was ...
- What?
What is it Tom?
I do not understand!
I will not hang to see
else you can do with me.
Are you afraid of me?
Sure that I'm afraid of you.
Every time I'm with you
weird things happen.
And you have control over.
I do not need
a vanilla cloud and this gezweef.
I am not a man who
woendagavond his poker night to give up.
We are talking about my free will.
Surely I need self control
about my own future.
Your future ...
That you kidding!
I mean it seriously.
Then there's a long way to go,
because the character of a man
- ... His future.
- That's right.
What? What did you say?
Was that a curse or something?
Yes, in your case it does.
- Good morning.
- We need to talk.
Yes, that stuff about you
yesterday in the kitchen left behind.
No, it's about Tom.
He departed last night.
We were kissing and
Then we were on the float.
Metaphorically float?
Literally float.
Literally float?
I do it all anymore.
You mean meters in midair ...
Nolan, that's not the point.
Amanda, what's the problem?
I'm just really confused.
You've probably him
very scared.
- Should I simply give him so now?
- No!
You should just let him
see that the love
even better than love.
I think I have his wallet
can bring it back.
Did you steal?
Of course not.
He had dropped it.
Yes, yes, when he floated ...
Very funny ...
You must read it.
We could well be able to save.
"TriBeCa-rediscovered gem:
magic in the kitchen. "
Who's there?
I agree.
Jezum, what's hot in here.
I open a window.
No, no, no.
Then she comes inside.
Who?
What happened to you?
It's Amanda, she's a witch....
You could not, I knew it!
They forced me!
I did not even have a chance.
And then suddenly I was on her ceiling.
And then she cursed me!
She said with a scary voice:
"A man's character is his future."
She is a wise witch,
who pronounces her curses in sayings.
Louis, I know you think
I've become crazy.
"It's that old black magic!"
"He has you in its grip."
You're in love.
If I now simply
The line had held.
Here is my rule: Eat, drink, take
everything the same and give back.
How did you get in?
The door ...
I just came to return this.
- You dropped it.
- That is fine.
I think you are Amanda.
Nice to meet you.
- I'm Louise and I go away.
- No, no, no, no!
You stay.
It's ok.
If you allow it to ...
Oh dear ...
I know the last few days
a little ... have been strange.
But my life has been mundane.
And then I met you ...
and amazing things happened.
And ...
And I can not explain them.
I know that you are disturbing them.
Tom, your life was full shows ...
But not mine ...
For the first time ...
... I feel that I can.
I do not know if I need you,
to maintain that feeling.
But I know I will.
Amanda, I ....
I think ...
How do you feel?
I'm not sure, Amanda.
I'm not sure.
This is not a knife!
- What are you doing!
- I spit on your knife!
What the hell are you doing!
I spit on your restaurant!
- And finally I spit on ...
- No, no, no!
Let me.
Are we okay now?
That was your first intelligent action.
- I absolve you!
- What are you talking about?
You can not fire me!
- Au revoir, asshole!
- Where are you going?
You can not just go away!
You're under contract!
Fantastic!
Believe me now?!
You think this is my fault?!
Amanda, if the broom fits,
then fly it!
Bartlett! You're an idiot!
- I just saw Valderon!
- Everything is fine.
What is your big plan?!
Now you have no boss!
- I have a great idea.
- I apologize.
- I was just leaving.
- No, Amanda.
- Jonathan, this is Amanda Shelton.
- How are you?
- She has made the eclairs ...
- We have a plan.
Bartlett Oh, you're a genius!
You've worked out the door to French jellyfish
and adopted angel!
- I'm not ...
- No, no, no!
No Jonathan, it does not cook for me!
- Why? Do you just deserts?
- No, but ...
- Is everything as good as that wonderful eclairs?
- Yes, but ...
Tom just told me that
Amanda is such a magical chef.
No, no, no, DEMONIC chief earlier.
- They can not!
- I can do.
I can do this,
He is just weird.
Amanda, this can not be serious. You want a
4-star chef to replace 23 years of experience?
- No sorry, that you really can not!
- I'm MAGIC! You said yourself!
Amanda, can you do this for tomorrow?
- No!
- Yes!
Louis, let Amanda
Please just look in the kitchen
while I'm talking with Tom.
- Fantastic!
- And Louis, are you busy
when I'm done with Tom?
You're the boss, Mr. Bendell.
No ... you .... you, the boss this time.
Dammit, Bartlett!
If you need anything, call me.
Although I can actually
only can buy clothes.
I'm not crazy,
I can not.
I just read your article in the newspaper!
What are you afraid of?
What is it?
I just need a few good weeks.
It's just the beginning of a
long period of luck.
Hope hope ...
Thank you.
But you'll both hands
need and I
So would you please state here
want to let go of my hand?
Sorry!
- Want it?
- Yes.
Oh my god ...
What the hell
with you on?
It! She's some kind of witch!
- You have no idea what it can do ...
- She's a fantastic cook!
Moreover, they are available tomorrow night
When everyone is
waiting for the most fantastic meal ever.
Let me try
Valderon to recover.
No, no, no you have me convinced of this.
Make it so that the balls
gathered to go through with it.
She can ruin us, Jonathan.
They will cook!
Growth once some balls, man!
And now you shave.
What are you doing here?
Stupid question ...
you work here.
You're probably wondering,
what I do here.
I just came here to
get used to the kitchen.
Tomorrow I'll know where everything is.
I see.
- Really?
- Sure.
You have everything you need?
I would like some more
want to have confidence, but ...
I'm going to the Peach ...
You want this do not know.
You just want me to tell you
that everything will go well, right?
That's it.
Good.
See you tomorrow.
Amanda?
Yes?
You are going ...
You're going to do anything weird to do tomorrow?
I hope?
No, nothing strange.
Happy.
Friday and Saturday closed
because one party in the center.
- Are you ready?
- I forgot my earrings!
You look beautiful.
Nolan, it all started
because I had my mother's earrings.
Can you give me a better cause
why suddenly I can cook?
Yes, because you wanted that day.
You wanted the food would be wonderful
and wanted you very much.
That's the magic, Amanda.
Not your mother's old earrings.
Ok?
Let's go.
Listen to me ...
Dumbo could fly even without his feather ...
Pardon?
Excuse me?!
Hi, I'm Amanda Shelton
and this is Nolan Traynor.
I'm your new boss.
And I wanted to say hello ...
Good start ...
That will come later.
You stay in the neighborhood.
I can use all the good friends now.
Sorry, Mademoiselle.
I am François Demer, sous-chef.
If you want, I have a suggestion.
That would be nice.
I have worked 15 years for the executive Valderon
I will go for him?
Thanks Francois, but Mr.
Bendell has asked me to cook tonight.
In that case ...
What do u. ..
Why not as usual.
I do, mademoiselle.
What do you do?
Waiting for instructions ...
Mr. Valderon always gives us instructions.
Why not start with the hors d'oeuvres?
Ready, mademoiselle.
Come on, you have the lion's den.
Ok.
- That's your lot from last year.
- What?
Oh shit!
Louis, I'm totally lost the plot.
There is something wrong with me.
She's really in her power.
You looks good enough to eat, kersencakeje.
Ok, but use it.
Are you insane?
That's Dom Perignon!
Exactly!
This is the best and you want it?
Do you know how expensive this stuff is?
Amanda, we serve the rich.
She anticipated duration.
Jonathan Louis, these are Hannah Wahlberg
and Frank Rogers of the Times.
Beautiful!
Gil, I'd like you to
to Jonathan Bendell.
Jonathan, this is Gil Shapiro.
He is the genius
behind "America's Kitchen '.
Jonathan, you have this
a real deal winner.
Everyone is shocked that you
Valderon gotten the hang of it.
That was not easy.
I wonder what he
voorschoteld us tonight.
These are pretty much ready.
François, I'm ready for the truffles.
There are no truffles.
What are you talking about?
Oui, there's absolutely no truffles.
Monsieur Valderon pick them yourself.
And so he brought them so.
I can no cream truffles
without truffles.
But if you can do with truffles?
Wait a minute, François.
Is everything okay here?
We are deep in the shit.
Beautiful!
Keep it up!
What did the Frenchman now?
All is well.
You look out.
- I can not.
- No!
Amanda, not now!
You're Patrick Ewing
and I'm John Starks.
The contest is almost over ...
Jordan gets the ball and he passes
Pippen and me.
Only you and him still.
He throws the ball, you get not
and they win the match.
Amanda, we are in the battle zone!
Do not let them walk all over you!
Are you ready?
Ok then.
You think I do not speak French?
Donne-moi des Figues!
-Give me some figs! -
De quoi?
Yes you. Figs!
Ok, I can.
I have to just go into different parts.
The menu must change.
The menu will change!
Tom, have you tried this?
It is fantastic!
No, Louis. I'm too nervous tonight.
Exceptional!
Figs, a delicious choice.
I wonder who invented it?
This evening full of surprises.
This looks delicious.
Sensational!
The foie gras melted on your tongue.
I so wish I could cook.
I always wanted to be a cook.
I did not.
This food is the perfect poem,
I have never written.
It is happiness,
that only occurs in dreams.
It is a symphony of joy,
a silver note.
It looks like love.
Pure love.
To love.
I'm sorry, but why Hannah?
The love that transforms in magic,
Once in a blue moon.
What do you mean everything is alright?
Everybody cries!
And this was just the appetizer.
It's fantastic.
Look around you, everybody loves it
look for a good cry.
It's refreshing.
I do not want you to panic,
but something is happening outside.
I'm sorry.
Why did I ever doubted you?
I admire you.
Like my grandfather.
But I do not hate you.
Really do not know!
It's okay.
Oh my god!
Do not try to panic!
And no swearing, Amanda!
I'm sorry.
Is the weather with you?
I'm sorry.
- Wait for the duck!
- No, Amanda! Come here!
Oh my god ...
I'm so stupid!
I've ruined everything!
I came here for Tom
to tell how much I love him.
And then I do this?
No he knows ...
- Please, do not you?
- It's all my fault.
What are you talking about?
This is typical for me.
Now we move to New Guinea
or somewhere else where nobody knows us.
- Did you eat at something?
- No.
I've eaten!
And it's great!
Amanda, you know it?
Everything you feel,
goes into your food.
No one goes away,
because it is irresistible!
All right, breathe.
I admit it all
a bit unusual.
But memorable.
Keep going.
You have to eat.
Perform?
I probably killed!
Bravo, mademoiselle ...
You will definitely leave
Now you've silenced all the guests mouth.
Gagged ...
I mean it,
We really need to get out of here.
It seems they are all dead.
No, no, they're not dead.
They're in a trance.
This is unbelievable.
Did you say a trance?
So we can do anything with them what we want?
No, no, no,
but it could be.
Amanda, make sure
all women love me
and all men need me
give their wallets.
-I can not do!
No!
But I can do something better.
Come on.
Fantastic.
- Louis, why is everyone so quiet?
- Sssshhhhh ....
This is insane ...
He is also disturbed ...
I know ...
Maybe he's too busy
with food to come.
Maybe you should think about the desert?
I can not handle this.
I do not know what to do.
Who do I kidding, Nolan?
He does not
and I can not blame him.
You know, I just go.
Can anyone take this?
Would you like me happy with a dance?
Amanda!
Hudson, J., please.
Pull me.
Success!
Here my dear ...
Taste a piece of heaven ...
I had to get shoes.
You're so beautiful.
I'm sorry I'm so
stupid've worn.
I just did not know what to do.
But I know I will.
I just want a second chance.
You've got this plate for your head,
that you may need fourth or fifth ...
I take what I can get.
I love you.
I hope you do not say the fog.
No, it's not.
Fortunately ...
Because I love you ...
I think I loved you
since I saw you in the market.
You mean when my hand in your pants Sat?
- Men are so easy ...
- Totally.
End
End.
Judy....
