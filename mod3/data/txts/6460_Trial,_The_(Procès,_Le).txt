The Trial
Before the law
there stands a guard.
A man comes from the country.
Begging admittance to the law.
But the guard cannot admit him.
"Can he hope to enter at a later time?"
"That is possible", says the guard.
The man tries to peer
through the entrance.
"He had been taught that the law
should be accessible to every man?"
"Do not attempt to enter without
my permission" says the guard.
"I am very powerful,
yet I am the least of all the guards."
From hall to hall,
door after door,
each guard is more powerful
than the last.
By the guard's permission the man
sits down by the side of the door
and there he waits.
For years
he waits.
Everything he has
he gives away...
in the hope of bribing the guard.
who never fails to say to him,
"I take what you give me...
...only so that you will not feel that
you have left something undone."
Keeping his watch during the long years
the man has learnt to
know even the fleas
and the guards fur collar.
And growing childish in old age
he begged the vilid fleas to persuade
the guard to change his mind
and allow him to enter.
His sight is dimmed but in the
darkness he perceives a radiance
streaming immortally
from the door of the law.
And now
before he dies...
all his experience condenses
into one question,
a question he has never asked.
He beckons to the guard.
Says the guard, "You are insatiable,
what is it now?"
Says the man,
"Every man...
strives to attain the law."
"How is it then...
that in all these years no one
else has ever come here...
seeking admittance?"
His hearing has failed,
so the guard yells into his ear
"No one else but you could have
ever of obtained admittance."
"No one else could enter this door...
this door
was intended
only for you."
"And now...
I'm going to close it."
This tale is told during
the story called <i>The Trial</i>.
It has been said that the
logic of this story...
is the logic of a dream
and a nightmare.
Miss Burstner?
You were expecting Miss Burstner?
Why no... No, what an
idea, of course not?
You spoke here name
just now.
When?
When I came in, you addressed
me as Miss Burstner.
Well that's her room
you know uh...
What are you doing in there?
Well, who are you?
What are you doing in here?
Miss Burstner frequently comes through
that door in the middle of the night?
Frequently? No! Never.
That door is kept permanently locked.
Mrs. Grubach keeps the key.
Just ask her.
Where is she?
Does she know about you?
Mrs. Grubach.
You were expecting
Mrs. Grubach?
No, no I'm...
Not expecting anybody,
least of all you,
whoever the hell you are.
Where you going?
Well I ...
think that Mrs. Grubach would like
to know that there are...
strange people wandering around her
apartment in the middle of the night.
You were starting in that direction
that's Mrs. Burstner's room.
- Isn't that what you told me?
- Yes it is and...
I would very much like to know
what's going on in there.
She isn't there now
Well that's not so
very surprising she...
She gets in late sometimes,
very late. Very late indeed.
You are the police?
- She gets in very late?
- Look, don't go jumping to conclusions.
- What conclusions?
- Well the hours...
they keep in her nightclub
are no fault of Mrs. Burstner's.
Look she'll be home any minute now
and I'm sure she'll be able to answer...
your questions for herself.
You are the police?
What makes you think we want
to ask questions of her?
Well I have no opinion
of it one way or another.
It's nothing to do with me,
I scarcely know this person.
Of course we are fellow lodgers...
but that's obvious.
Is she in some kind of trouble?
What kind of trouble?
Do you imagine we came
here to see Mrs. Burstner?
Well you certainly didn't
come here to see me.
Did you?
Well listen you don't deny anything
or affirm anything you just
stand there and stare at me in the
middle of my private bedroom at...
6:14 in the morning.
I don't see why I should
put up with it.
You haven't even identified yourself
or show me your papers.
- Isn't that for you to do?
- Oh no, my papers, excuse me,
my papers are in perfect order.
Here, see for yourself.
Why don't you finish getting dressed?
For your information
I am a man of...
regular habits and getting dressed
at 6:15 in the morning doesn't
happen to be one of them.
Still, I don't suppose there is any
hope of getting any more sleep.
Where are you going?
I take a bath in the morning
if you must know.
Why?
If you were reluctant to
dress in front of me...
And I dress in the bathroom.
Huh?
Yes.
Why?
Well it's warm in the bathroom...
and it's cold in the hall.
Any more questions?
Why would you want
to dress in the hall?
Stay here.
Why would you want to get
dressed out in the hall?
I don't. I don't...
but...
If I did not get dressed in the bathroom
after I finished my bath, I'd be...
obliged to walk down the drafty hall,
in my silk dressing room
right after getting, after...
out of a warm tub.
I hope you understand.
- You said you wanted to get
dressed in the hall. - No, no.
- Did you?
- No.
OK, have it your way mister.
But what do you want to get all
dressed up for anyway?
You're not going nowhere,
you're under arrest.
You're making a formal charge?
Oh, I couldn't do that mister.
Just exactly what is it
I'm charged with?
You'll have to take that
up with the inspector.
- Proceedings having been...
- That was the inspector who just left.
...you until called for interrogation.
You were retired to your room.
- I'm in my room.
- Huh?
- I'm in my room.
- I can't help that mister.
You got a lot of real
nice shirts here mister.
- Leave those shirts alone.
- Know something?
You do a whole lot better
givin' them things to us.
After they're impounded officially and
carted off to headquarters you won't
know what happens to them shirts.
There's every kind of crook and
bribery in them public auctions.
- Now we're your friends
- Sure we are you...
oughta give us some of
them shirts at least.
Well it could be a joke I suppose.
Elaborate practical joke by some
of my friends in the office.
They're In there.
Who's in there?
You're from my office.
Who brought you here?
The police?
These clerks from my office,
what do they got
to do with it?
Rebenstein, Culy y Caminer right?
What's this?
That's her mother she
was in the profession.
- Leave her things alone.
- Cannabis?
You especially.
Rebenstein, what are
you doing here?
The inspector said he thought it
would be sorta more unabusive if
they went with you to the
office so nobody would notice
Unobtrusive is the word you're
looking for not unabusive.
How can I got to the office
if I'm under arrest?
That don't need to keep you
from working, not at this stage.
He...
- He said I have to stay in my room.
- He was reading the wrong page.
Well this obviously isn't anything
of any importance.
Quite honestly, I can't remember...
a single offence that could
be charged against me.
It's obviously a mistake,
something very trivial.
What the real question is...
who accuses me?
- Well...
- What do you mean?
- What authority...
- Don't you worry about that mister.
I'm sorry to disappoint you but...
I'm afraid you won't find any
subversive literature or pornography.
Don't touch those record albums.
What's this thing?
That's my pornograph.
- ...my phonograph
- What's this?
What's what?
A circular line with four holes.
- Circular.
- No, it's not
really circular
it's more ovular.
Don't write that down
for god's sake.
- Why not?
- Ovular...
We can't not write it down just
because you say we shouldn't.
Ovular isn't even a word.
You deny that there is
an ovular shape...
concealed under this rug?
He denies everything.
Mrs. Grubach's husband
was a dentist.
Oh, there she is now.
Mrs. Grubach? Mrs. Grubach?
This was Dr. Grubach's office.
That don't matter she
can't come in here.
That dental chair was screwed to
these four places in the floor.
You want some good
advice mister?
Well...
I wouldn't want the others
to hear about it.
Oh now you want
money I suppose.
Well you've got
the wrong man.
That's what they all say.
I mean bribery I don't
happen to believe in it.
No, wait a minute have I asked you
to give me anything sir? Mister?
- We're leaving mister.
- You not gonna be...
one of them troublemakers,
now are you?
- Mrs. Grubach.
- Good morning Mr. K.
I've got your
breakfast ready.
Listen mam I wish
you'd tell him...
he really doesn't think
that he's guilty,
and he should keep it to himself,
you see what I mean?
In this stage of the game this kinda
thing makes a very lousy impression.
I'm afraid I owe you an
apology Mrs. Grubach.
Oh no, Mr. K.
This is not gonna happen again,
I can promise you that.
A lot of things happen
in this world Mr. K.
Yes.
You're my most
valued lodger Mr. K.
I think I owe it
to you to be frank.
- Yes, by all means.
- You're all good I'm thinking of...
and I really have that at heart,
perhaps more then I should.
After all I'm only your landlady.
Well, I managed to have a few
words alone with that inspector.
And?
It seems you are
under arrest Mr. K.
Yes, I know that.
But not the way a thief's
put under arrest.
- No.
- No.
No, with your arrest...
I get the feeling of something abstract,
if you see what I mean?
It's so abstract I can't even
consider that it applies to me.
Of course not Mr. K.
Aren't you going to eat something?
Two men coming into my room the way
they did, well I simply wasn't prepared.
Now in the office, for instance,
I'm always prepared.
You can't just crash in on me there,
I should say not. People sometimes
have to wait for weeks before they can
even get in to where they can speak,
and my secretary....
No, my mistake
was letting them start in on me
before I even have a cup of coffee.
Coffee is always ready
on the stove Mr. K.
I keep it there
for Miss Burstner.
When she gets in from work,
such ungodly hours she keeps.
- Well, that's her profession.
- I suppose so.
The hours they keep in that nightclub
are no fault of Miss Burstner's.
Perhaps not. Do you think I ought
to offer those men some coffee?
What men?
The ones from your office,
they're still in there.
In Mrs. Burstner's bedroom?
My God I thought you'd left.
What are you doing here?
Culy, Caminar...
Rebenstein.
Put those pictures back
where you found them.
- Here's some coffee for the gentlemen.
- No, Mrs. Grubach...
these people are not
friends of mine.
They came with the police and they
should have left with the police.
Please be good enough to
show them to the door.
Yes, Mr. K.
This way gentlemen.
What are you anyway, informers?
What do you have to inform about?
And you're still here.
You're attracting attention Mr. K.
Attracting attention...
I'd appreciate the return of my
identification papers please.
You seriously think that we
don't know who you are.
Really Mr. K. you're not doing
your case any good you know.
Exactly what is this case
you've been talking about?
I'm not talking about it
Well why not?
Why don't you talk about it?
What am I charged with?
Not for me to talk
about your case.
Inspector...
Yes?
What's the charge?
Mr. K, you aren't claiming
innocence are you?
Naturally...
I'm also claiming invasion of privacy
and rank abuse of basic civil rights.
- Hold on not quite so fast...
- Oh, I don't pretend to know
the legal terminology but I can get a
lawyer to help me out about that.
It also happens that a very
well known advocate
is a close personal friend
of the family's.
You aren't threatening to register
an official complaint are you?
Yes. I am, I am and
I might also mention
a rather clumsy attempt
to work me for a bribe.
There she comes,
your friend Mrs. Burstner.
Yes, well she's not
exactly my friend.
Not that it's any
business of yours.
Are you going to stay
here all morning?
What do we do now
take fingerprints?
We can do that
at the station.
Station?
Where else could you register
an official complaint.
Oh well, we can
forget about that...
It's on the record.
You did use the word
"threatening".
No, that was
your word.
What's this? What's this
"pornograph"?
Oh, don't try to make
anything out of that.
No?
Not unless you
have a dirty mind.
- Excuse me
- No, no you stay Mrs. Grubach.
None of this is going to show up
very well on the record Mr. K.
My men say you even tried to
stop them from putting this down.
Well, I tried to stop one of them
from making a fool of himself
- Yes. Yes, ovular.
- What's that?
Ovular.
There is no such word.
"Mrs. Grubach's husband
was a dentist."
Now what's that got to
do with you case?
I never said that it did.
Then why mention
such a thing?
Simply by way of explaining
that ovular shape.
"Ovular shape."
You go on solemnly
writing it all down.
There has to be a
record doesn't there?
But this foolish babbling
It's not going to make
much of an impression,
I can tell you that Mr. K.
Won't look
well at all.
Gibberish.
Babbling.
I'm glad he's gone.
I was worried he might
start on Miss Burstner.
- Oh she's on her way up.
- Later than ever.
Well let's hope she was safely away last
night before these men got into her room.
What time does
she go to work?
I believe she had to be
dressed or undressed
for that first performance
at midnight.
Ya, the supper show.
Well I don't know
what they call it.
The supper show.
I'm sure I wouldn't know.
Well that's what they call it.
I've never been inside one
of those places in my life.
Indeed, you may have wondered why
I continue to rent my second best room
to a woman of that sort.
- What do you mean?
- What? Theatricals Mr. K.
This isn't really the place for
them as I'm sure you'll agree.
You see I didn't know?
She came with her mother...
perfectly respectable woman,
or so she seemed.
And when she died
well I...
I'm always...
too softhearted for
my own good.
- Mrs. Grubach?
- Yes?
- What are you trying to say?
- Well...
I get the impression that you're heading
in something concerning Miss Burstner.
Well since you asked Mr. K.
She not only performs in that place...
but sits drinking
afterwards with men.
What I asked Mrs. Grubach
was whether or not you were casting
aspersions on the moral character
of one of your own lodgers.
Oh. Mr. K you shouldn't
put it that way.
Goodnight, Mrs. Grubach.
I wouldn't dream of
getting rid of...
You have to admit Mr. K
it's in the interest of all my guests
to keep our house
completely beyond reproach.
Beyond reproach?
Mrs. Grubach, if you're going to start
throwing people out of this house
you'd better begin with me.
Goodnight, Mrs. Grubach.
You didn't understand.
Goodnight, Mrs. Grubach.
- Goodnight Mr. K.
- Goodnight.
Miss Burstner?
Yes?
Good evening.
Or, good morning rather.
If you're stuck for something
to say try happy birthday.
Oh is it your birthday?
Is that why you're coming home
so much later than usual?
I didn't know you kept track
of my hours, Mister...
Well, I didn't mean that. Of course
it's none of my business what time
you come home at night.
It's nobody's business.
That's fine, goodnight.
Happy birthday!
Oh, oh, excuse me!
Excuse me!
No, no...
Yes?
Well that's what's I ought
to have done, naturally...
What?
What ought you
to have done?
Well after I knocked,
I should've...
waited for me to invite you
to come in, as you did.
Come in.
You're not getting any
funny ideas are you?
Of course not.
Just because I knocked
on your door...
Well that's what I mean
you did, didn't you?
So why don't you?
You're a nice boy,
but I'm not in the mood for it.
It's been a long hard night.
Yes it has been.
What do you
know about it?
I was talking
about myself.
That's what they all do.
What else do they
ever talk about?
So give me a rest will you.
Alright.
Alright what?
Well I'll do whatever
you say but...
if you don't want me to talk to
you and you won't come in...
How can I come in?
That old bag's just dying for
a chance to throw me out.
Mrs. Grubach?
Out of the house, she's
always got one ear open.
What's wrong?
I told you, I'm tired.
I'm sorry.
I forgot what I wanted to ask you.
Maybe it will come back to you.
Nothing ever comes back to me.
Big statement...
Shut up everybody.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry, you're sorry, you're sorry.
You always keep saying that.
Who gives a damn?
I know I'm sor...
What's the big joke?
I'm almost said it again.
You're right of course,
you're perfectly right.
- Ya?
- Nobody gives a damn.
- I know you don't
- I know...
Hey keep the door
open, please!
I was agreeing
with you.
Oh sure.
- What you just said.
- I don't know what I've just said.
Oh Jesus, all that lousy champagne.
You know what they
make it out of?
No.
Neither does
anybody else.
No switching with the
cold tea either, not tonight.
The customer knew all about that one
he kept taking cute little sips
out of my glass just to make sure
I was getting myself putrefied.
I'm sorry.
Damn! There I go again.
It's never any use is it
apologizing, it's even worse
when you haven't done anything
wrong and you still feel guilty.
I can remember my
father looking at me,
you know straight in the eye,
"Come on boy!" he'd say.
"Exactly what have
you been up to?"
And even when I hadn't been up to
anything at all I'd still feel guilty.
You know that feeling?
And the teacher at school
making the announcement
that something was
missing from her desk.
"Alright who's the guilty one?"
It was me of course.
I'd feel just sick with guilt.
And I didn't even
know what was missing.
Maybe...
Ya that must be it.
Unless your thoughts
are innocent...
one-hundred percent.
Could that be said of anybody?
Even the saints have temptations.
What do you think?
I think you're crazy.
Maybe you're right that
would certainly explain...
No, I must reject that. I must
reject every thing, but fact.
I am sane.
I'm innocent.
- I have committed no crime.
- Three cheers for you.
- You don't believe me.
- Sure I believe you.
Well be honest,
what do you really think?
You've been out some place.
Drinking you mean?
Is that what you think?
That I've been out drinking
and I'm drunk?
Well next time you do come to my place
I get a percentage on every bottle.
Miss Burstner, I've not left this
apartment since I got back
from the office last night.
And I am not a solitary drinker.
Then what's your problem?
I'm under arrest.
Ya?
Unbelievable isn't it?
- Well it happens.
- Well that's just the point...
I don't know how it happens.
- I haven't the remotest idea...
- How do you know you're arrested?
It isn't something that you just
suddenly notice like bleeding gums.
- They woke me up and told me.
- Are you sure you were awake?
Ya, well if you think I was dreaming
just look at those photographs.
- That's my mother.
- Well...
Different poses Burstner's
birds are real good at.
Let's leave my mother out of it,
do you mind?
- Of Course
- No offence.
- What did they get you for?
- Oh, I wouldn't say they got me.
They arrested you isn't
that what you told me?
That's what they told me.
- What's the charge?
- That's what they didn't tell me.
All I know is that I'm supposed to
appear before some kind of
interrogation commission,
that's all I know.
- That's only for serious crimes
- That's what I thought!
Did they tell you that your
crime wasn't serious?
No they didn't say that.
Maybe it's a gag
or something...
That thought occurred to me at first, you
know some of the fellas at the office,
some kind of elaborate
practical joke but...
I didn't really believe that,
I just wanted to...
It's awful how easy it is to
get demoralized, isn't it?
Well of course that's
what they want.
That's what they're
counting on.
- I'm not such a fool that I don't...
- You must've done something.
You must've done something.
Oh, don't say that,
don't you say that.
Somebody's been telling
lies about you...
Could be it, rumours they're
always flying around for no reason.
- Rumours...
- Well at the office...
What kind of rumours?
You mean in my case?
That's just it I haven't
the faintest idea.
- Jesus, I hope it isn't political.
- Oh no, nothing like that.
Politics! Don't go
dragging me into it.
No, Miss Burstner I'm afraid
we just talk in circles.
That's not my fault,
I'm not talking in circles.
I don't even want to talk.
What are you doing in here anyway?
- Well you invited me.
- That's what you say.
- Miss Burstner please...
- Please what?
Listen if you're in trouble
I'm sorry, I'm real sorry
but keep me out of it.
I did, I am, I told them you didn't
have anything to do with me but
they wouldn't listen
it was maddening
and then when they started to mess
around with your mother's photograph.
What! Who's been messing around
with my mother's photograph?
Rebenstein, I think it was.
But also the police.
- The police?
- Well that's what I've been telling you.
- Miss Burstner...
- Get out! Get out of here.
- Miss Burstner please...
- Get out and stay out
and leave me alone.
Miss. Burstner please and
what will the other lodgers think
and Mrs. Grubach
you will wake her...
Get the hell out of my room.
Well, I'm out.
- Mr. K.
- Good morning if there's anybody
waiting I'll see them in a minute.
The deputy manager,
he was looking for you Mr. K.
I think he's in the hall
and your cousin's here.
My cousin?
She's not supposed
to come to the office.
She said it was serious.
K.
Oh, good morning sir.
I was just arranging an
old birthday surprise.
In here?
In this broom closet?
Well I have this,
this, this...
This birthday cake for one of
my fellow lodgers. I didn't think...
I ought to carry the
thing to the office.
- Don't you agree?
- Who is she?
If I'd only know about
this lady before...
she would've been included
in the invitation tonight.
- But the tickets are all booked...
- Oh I know, I know
She'll understand, I hope
your girl won't be too much...
I saw her unpleasantness already
sir, and it can't be much worse...
The cake is actually
a peace offering.
If she doesn't take it then
she's not the right girl for you.
Who's that?
That's my cousin Irmie.
What's she doing here?
- What are you doing?
- Your cousin huh...
Yes, from the city, going to the
school from the...
country going to school
here in the city.
- I'm supposed to keep an eye on her.
- We'll have to keep an eye on you, man.
- She looks pretty young.
- Yes, sir.
There's a place for
everything, right K?
Oh, and she's never dared to
come in the office before sir
I can assure you of that.
You're a bright young man, one of
our brightest. On the way up.
- Don't spoil things for yourself.
- No.
- How old is she?
- What? Irmie, oh...
Can't be more then 16, if that.
Ya.
My God!
Mr. K the young lady...
Get her out of here.
But she said that it's urgent...
I don't care what she says
just get her out of here.
I beg your pardon but
isn't that Miss Burstner's trunk?
- And what if it is?
- Well I thought I recognized it
Here, you take the birthday cake.
I have quite enough on my hands
with this trunk.
Well yes that's what I mean
now let me help you with it.
- Here take this.
- No, thank you.
- Please.
- No, thank you.
Well at least
let me call you a cab.
Not everyone can
afford taxicabs Mr. K.
You know my name?
Excuse me? You are a
friend of hers I gather?
I wonder if you can
tell me if she's home.
If by home you refer to
Mrs. Grubach's establishment,
the answer to your question is no.
Marika does have a home...
but it's not at Mrs. Grubach's.
Marika
Pardon?
I never knew her first name.
How ironic.
You say, she has a home,
you mean another home?
Yes, she has one loft luckily.
I wish you'd let me help you with
that trunk it seems quite heavy.
- Extremely heavy
- Well then...
I'll take it by myself,
thank you.
Take it to her...
You'll take it to where?
I hope it's not your
intention to follow me.
- No, not at all.
- Up to now...
you've been dogging
my footsteps.
Well I hate to
see a woman...
dragging a great heavy trunk
like that, that's all.
Especially one with a physical
disability isn't that what you mean?
- No, not at all, I...
- Since you find
the spectacle so
unpleasant Mr. K.
Why not spare your feelings
and remove yourself
from the cause of your distress.
I'm sorry.
Listen the last thing I want
is to annoy you but...
I would like very much to know
if Miss Burstner is moving...
or is planning to move...
and if so where to?
Anything else?
Yes. Well yes, I'd like to know why.
Why is she moving?
And you have the unmitigated gall
to pretend you don't know.
Well no, how could I?
I've just got home.
I mean we did talk this morning but
she didn't seem to be planning to move.
She wasn't Mr. K.
It came as a very nasty surprise.
You make it sound as if
I were responsible.
Do you pretend you have
nothing to do with it?
I don't pretend anything.
All we did was talk,
though I did kiss her.
I hope you're not, not trying to tell me
that it's just because I kissed her.
She's changing her address
just because I kissed her.
I mean after all, she's a
woman of the world.
She works at the nightclub.
What are you insinuating?
Well nothing but you have to admit
she's a grown woman not a minor.
Somebody must have
kissed her before.
Do you think this is a topic to be
shouted through the public streets?
Oh Hell! Hell!
There is no need to curse.
Why am I always in the wrong
without even knowing what for,
or what it's all about?
That's not something I'm prepared
to discuss with you Mr. K.
You better examine
your own conscience.
Ya, well there's nothing wrong
with my conscience, thank you.
Nothing at all.
Marika has been staying with Mrs Grubach
longer then you have Mr. K.
Don't forget that.
She was very fond of that room.
My poor little room is dark
and damp and poorly heated.
She won't be nearly
as comfortable with me...
Well then why does she...
- move, for god's sake!
- Don't you shout at me Mr. K.
I'm a woman and a cripple...
but that doesn't mean I have to
stand for your abuse.
Go scream at that
Grubach woman.
Wait a minute.
You don't mean...
Hell, it's late.
I'll never get dressed
for the theatre.
First you've got to give me the truth.
Now did Mrs. Grubach ask her to leave?
I thought you didn't know
what happened Mr. K.
Oh she did make a few uncalled
for remarks about Miss Burstner.
I took exception to them,
very strong exception.
I told Mrs. Grubach
in no uncertain terms
that she was out of line.
Oh my dear...
You mean she...
Just, threw her out?
Well I guess, I guess
I am responsible.
Listen Miss...
uh, Mrs...
Excuse me, sir...
Excuse me, but I have
a note here for you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes. It's for you.
Somebody passed it
down, over there.
- Where?
- I think it's the man there maybe.
Mr. K.
Come with me Mr. K.
We're making every reasonable
effort at this point.
To keep from interfering unnecessarily
with the normal pattern of your life.
For instance...
So you wouldn't have to request special
leave of absence from your office...
We've arranged to fit in
these interrogations,
outside your normal
working hours.
Step into the light Mr. K.
Who are they?
I can't expect you to know where the
interrogation commission is sited.
That's right, I don't.
I've filled this out in your name
and so you won't get lost.
I've drawn you a
little map on the back.
Thanks.
You present that
immediately on arrival.
And when is that?
Immediately
Tonight?
I hope you won't have too
much trouble locating it.
Well if I do these two can
always set me straight.
What exactly do you mean?
Aren't they supposed to trail
around after me wherever I go,
observing my movements.
No...
They aren't going to follow you.
That isn't their job.
Go right in there.
I've gotta close the doors after you
nobody else must come in.
You should have been here
one hour and five minutes ago.
These delays must not occur again.
Please step up.
You are a house painter?
No.
The question from the
examining magistrate
about my being a
house painter...
seems typical of this so called trial
that's being hoisted upon me.
From the very notebook of
the examining magistrate
confirms what I say.
These are the examining
magistrates records.
What's happening to me
is of no great importance.
But I think it is representative
of what's happening to a
great many other
people as well.
And it's for these others that I take
my stand here, not for myself alone.
That's it boy give em hell!
I have been arrested
and perhaps...
considering the magistrate's
opening statement,
perhaps they had orders
to arrest some house painter.
Who may well
be as innocent as I am.
...furthermore they even
tried to get me to bribe them,
to steal my clothes and shirts from me.
I managed to keep calm.
I asked them very simply,
why I was arrested...
And what was the answer
of your self-styled inspector?
If he were here he would
have to back me up in this.
Gentlemen, he answered
in effect nothing at all.
He had arrested me
that was enough.
I noticed that your examining magistrate
has just given some of you a secret sign.
Well I don't know whether
that sign was meant to be a...
a signal for applause
or to hiss me...
but, I hereby publicly empower
the examining magistrate
to address his entire
intentions out loud.
- Let him say.
- Hiss now or a clap
now whatever he wants.
Can there be any doubt
that behind my arrest
a vast organization
is at work.
And establishments which contains
a retinue of civil servants, officers,
police and others,
perhaps even hangmen.
I notice that all of you are
wearing the same badge.
So is every damn one of you here
is an official of some kind.
That means you've all
come rushing in here
to listen to nose out
what you can about me.
Half of you clap,
It was just to lead me on.
Get out of my way.
Maybe you wanted some practise
in fooling an innocent man.
Perhaps you found some
amusement in the fact that I
seriously expected you
to be interested in justice.
One Moment.
I only wish to point out that tonight
you have thrown away...
with your own hand...
all the advantages which an interrogation
invariably converts on an accused man.
Just you wait.
Sir...
What are you
doing here?
We're gonna
get flogged.
- You're what?
- We're gonna be beat.
- It's all because of
you mister. - Ya, ya.
- Hey, why...
- It's all your fault mister...
You caused that thing about
us to the authorities.
You accused us
of corruption.
You lodged a complaint.
I only mentioned it
to the inspector.
And to the
examining magistrate.
Come on
let's get on with it.
You accused us of
soliciting for bribes.
Well you're not
exactly innocent...
If you knew what kinda money
we're expected to live on
you wouldn't be so hard on us.
I've got a family to feed.
Frank here wants to get married.
Anyways it's the custom for
the arresting officers
to get the prisoner's body linen.
What difference can a
few shirts make to anybody?
- Once he's arrested...
- Nothing
Nothing at all but still you had to
go ahead and denounce us.
Well it wasn't anything personal
I was just defending a principle.
Didn't I tell you?
I told you the gentleman...
if it wasn't for them shirts and...
before he had found out about it.
And nothing would have happened if you
hadn't gone ahead and denounced it.
It's because of you
that we're punished.
What kind of justice
do you call that?
We've all got clean records,
me especially.
Take him for instance if anybody ever'd
lodged a complaint against him
you think he'd be
where he is now?
- Come on let's get on with it.
-  ...how painful it is...
You too, strip.
We even have to take
off our clothes.
Look.
What do you want?
If you could see your way through
to letting him off just this once,
I'd certainly appreciate it.
What are you trying to do?
- Nothing
- You plan to lodge...
a complaint against me?
No, I haven't lodged
any complaint.
Why if I wanted those men
to be punished I'd...
I could just leave right now
and close the door...
and close my eyes and ears
and forget about the whole thing.
But I don't think they
should be punished.
They're not to blame.
It's the people above them
that should be punished.
The authorities,
the whole organization.
Now if it were one of the
high judges you were flogging
I wouldn't mind a bit.
I'd even pay extra to
incur to the good work.
I don't take bribes.
Not in any circumstances.
Please, please.
Please, please try to
get me off of here.
Frank, here he's older than I am...
his nerves are better, he can take it.
He's been punished before,
but your only single...
I can't wait any longer.
He won't get into trouble
He knows better.
Save me!
Mr. K.
What?
Mr. K, there's a man in your office.
He says he's your uncle Max.
Uncle Max.
Well my boy.
What brings you into town?
Josef
Is it true?
Yes it's...
Yes it's true enough
I'm afraid.
And you're under arrest?
Please, uncle Max.
We'll talk about it later.
Very well then...
Just go ahead with
your work, my boy.
Don't mind me.
- It's not a criminal case is it?
- It is.
Well?
That's...
That's what they tell me.
And you just coolly sit here?
If you won't think
of yourself...
What?
If you won't think of yourself
think of the family,
our good name.
How did you...
find out about it?
Irmie called me on the
long distance telephone.
- Irmie...
- Ya, poor little Irmie...
whom you wouldn't so much as
receive here in your office.
I can't hold...
lengthy conversations
with family relatives
during working hours.
- I suppose that applies to me too.
- Oh, uncle Max.
My only thought when I made
this long exhausting trip
was just to try to help you.
But no...
You don't even
want to see me.
Yes, of course I do but...
You must realize...
how difficult it is...
during working hours.
Well, it looks to me as though your
working hours are over Josef.
Come on.
After all Josef
I'm the nearest thing...
to a parent and a father that you
can lay claim to in the world.
Don't forget that.
Oh, I don't forget it,
Uncle Max, believe me.
We've got to get some
competent legal advice Josef.
Things like this don't happen right
out of the blue and in a criminal case...
Please, uncle Max
people are listening.
What's that up there?
The computer.
- One of those electronic gimmicks?
- Yes
Can give you the
answer to anything?
Yes.
- Well...
- Well what?
You want to know about your case,
don't ya? Ask the machine.
We wouldn't be allowed.
These things can always
be arranged, can't they?
Well what would I ask?
Uncle Max, I...
I don't even know
what I'm charged with.
Well that's one question
the brain thing...
ought to be able to
figure it out for you.
Well she'd need the data
economic, sociological,
psychological.
Still she might be able to handle it, she
screens and processes personality tests.
But first an awful lot of material
would have to be fed to her.
It's a she?
That's the way the experts
talk about her.
I see like for a
car or a boat
kind of affectionate.
Well respectably,
more than that.
Love?
Terror?
I don't know.
Well if she's a woman
I'd be careful.
Wait a minute.
It's uh...it must be a dog somewhere
it's just a little dog in the courtyard.
You know?
He's putting a piece of tape
over our mouths, don't worry
with the tape on you won't
hear any screaming.
Good, see?
You can't hear
anything.
This gentlemen says he's in charge
of the electronic brain, Josef.
We're not in charge.
One of the technical
experts anyways.
You talk about data and facts.
Well, crime is a fact isn't it?
Suppose I committed a crime
or rather suppose I hadn't.
Uncle Max, these men
are extremely busy.
It seems they work in shifts
on the computer.
Yes, our night people have
more leisure after eleven.
- They could show him around.
- That's alright.
Thank you, come on.
I agree with you Josef,
all these fancy electronics.
They're alright in their place
but not for anything practical.
Please, uncle Max.
You're not gonna try to tell me
you think you can diddle
your way out of a criminal charge
with an adding machine.
Open up in there.
We're friends of the advocate.
We've got to see him on
very important business I
don't care how busy he is.
We've got to see him now.
K's the name announce
him will you.
She doesn't look like a maid
to me more like a nurse.
The advocate is ill.
Ill? You say he's ill?
His heart again I suppose
he never was too healthy.
This may be a strange hour to
be paying a professional call
but good old Hastler isn't going
to hold that against us.
We used to go to school together.
You've heard me speak of him.
I know he had quite a
reputation in junior high.
Leni?
No Albert, it's me,
it's Max, Albert.
Leni I told you I'm too
ill for visitors.
Don't let these people in.
Go away.
- Albert, don't you remember me?
- No.
It's your old friend Max.
Who's that with you there?
Hello Albert, what's
wrong? How did...
Had another of your attacks?
Don't worry you always get over them.
Are they looking
after you properly?
Terribly gloomy in here.
No lights...
power failure of course but...
And what about this
nurse of yours?
Who Leni?
Leni is a
good girl.
Very good girl indeed.
Leni takes excellent
care of me.
- Don't you darling?
- Yes.
Miss would you be kind enough to
leave us alone for a while.
I must speak to the advocate
on personal business.
You can say whatever you...
You can't talk business
to him now.
What you
damn little...
We can discuss anything...
in front of Leni,
she's very, very...
This doesn't concern myself.
It's not my own
private affair.
Whom does it concern?
My nephew I brought him
here with me.
Who?
- Josef K.
- Whom?
Josef K...
I didn't notice him.
So... so you came to
see me about this case.
That's good.
It's a most interesting affair.
Careful now Josef.
You know about
my case already?
How's that?
I...
couldn't understand.
I'm the one that
doesn't understand.
It is your case isn't it...
you wanted to
consult me about.
Of course it is
what's wrong with you.
Mr. Hastler seems to have heard
about me and my case before
we even thought
of coming here.
Oh, in the circles I move in,
all sorts of different cases
naturally come up in discussion,
and the more interesting ones
stick in my mind.
Particularly something concerning
the nephew of an old friend of mine.
Of course. That's
logical Josef.
You say you move
in these circles...
Does that mean you're actually
connected with the courts?
With whom else
should I associate...
if not with men of
my own profession.
That's a need incontrovertible.
I'm handicapped these
days by illness.
But good friends from the
law court still visit me here
from time to time when I'm in
a state to speak to them.
For instance there's a
dear friend of mine.
Visiting here at this
very moment.
We were chatting here together
when you two burst in and
took us by surprise.
He preferred to withdraw
with his chair and his table
into the corner.
The chief clerk
of the law court.
Where?
I beg your pardon sir.
I forgot to introduce you.
This is my old friend K...
and his nephew.
I know sir that you're
interested in this case.
Josef K.
Leave us Leni.
Naturally the chief clerk
is a very busy man...
but since this case
does concern us all
perhaps you stay for
a moment and advise us.
Oh my, yes we'd certainly
be honoured.
I can stay for only a few
minutes longer unfortunately.
It's clear, we know how
pressed you are for time.
The chief clerk will tell you
my dear old friend...
I've defended a great
number of these cases Max
and we've succeeded in
winning a few of them.
- At least partially
- In parts of it...
The important thing now
is to get our first plea ready.
That often determines the whole
course of subsequent proceedings.
However, in actual practise
the first plea is not usually
read by the court at all.
Oh, and why is that?
Very often they simply...
file it away.
I think your friend here
should be warned
that the case of Josef K is likely to be
followed through any number of courts.
And sometimes the case
never reaches verdict...
I broke the glass.
Why did you
do that?
To attract your attention.
I wanted you to
come here to me.
I was thinking of you too.
In there you couldn't
keep your eyes off me.
And yet you'd
like me to wait.
I couldn't just get up and walk
out of the room without any excuse.
No, no that's not mine.
You did it though.
Yes, I did.
That's not my coat.
If you're going out
you'd better take this.
- No, no...
- You weren't wearing a coat.
- This is one of...
- I'm not going out...
I can't even stay here.
I've got to get back to them.
I know you don't
really like me.
But I'm going to make love to you
and then you won't be able to go.
Ya, but what will
I say back there?
You don't like me at all?
Well like is a very
feeble word.
You've got a sweetheart?
- No.
- I'll bet you do...
have one a boy like you is
bound to have somebody.
- Well as a matter of fact...
- Tell me about her.
Well there's not
much to tell really.
I don't even know where
she lives anymore.
- I've got a photograph...
- Ah, you've got a photograph.
What is she some
kind of an actress.
No, a dancer.
She's not so young is she...
I don't think I like her.
She looks hard and selfish.
A girl like that wouldn't be able
to sacrifice herself for a man.
Well certainly not for me.
Has she got any
physically defect.
What?
Has she got any
physically defect?
Why no, of course not.
If you don't know where she's scarred
I guess she doesn't mean much to you
or you'd find out.
I'll find out.
I've got a physically defect.
I'll show you.
Come on.
Look.
The skin between my
two middle fingers.
Like a web.
A web...
What a pretty little palm.
You'd better go.
Go? I just got in
I'll say you weren't
feeling well or something...
that you needed
some fresh air.
I'll be back in a minute.
To let you out I've
got to get the keys.
The keys?
Are we locked in here?
I don't want you locked out.
The keys are to let you in
yourself, during the nights.
Whenever you feel like it.
Good.
Who's that?
- What that picture?
- Yes.
That could be my
judge I suppose.
I know him.
He's not a big man
like that...
he's little...
almost a dwarf.
But look the way he
had himself painted.
He's vain...
of course like
everybody else here.
I'm vain myself...
and it bothers me that you don't
like me more than you do.
You mean you've got high court judges
coming here to see you.
Oh no, he's just an
examining magistrate.
Only an examining magistrate?
Boy, the higher officials certainly
keep themselves well hidden.
These fancy robes and the gown
are just an invention.
Actually he sits on a kitchen chair with
an old hose wrapped ragged under him.
- Ow!
- Do you always be..
brooding over your case.
Probably, I don't think
enough about it.
No, that's not the mistake
you're making.
You're too stubborn and too much of a
troublemaker, that's what I hear.
Who told you that?
You mustn't ask me for names.
Just take my warning to heart and try
to be a little more cooperative.
Cooperative?
Oh, brother...
The first chance you get you ought
to make your confession.
Till you do that there isn't a hope
of getting out of their clutches.
Not a hope...
and even then you will need
a lot of help from the outside.
- Leni!
- Josef!
Leni!
Josef!
Leni where are you...
Leni darling...
Chief Clerk is leaving...
accompany him to the door.
- Goodnight Clerk.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, it's getting late.
- Albert, please go one with...
what you were saying
about advocates.
Advocates, they do everything
they can to discourage us.
You should see the rule they have
for advocates in the law courts.
- Small they have...
- No...
There's a tiny
skylight up high...
...some other advocate
to hoist you up on his back.
For more then a year now
there's been a hole in the floor.
A hole, Albert?
Not quite big enough to fall through
or if you stumble into it.
You find yourself with your leg
hanging out of the...
The very place where all
your clients have to worry.
I had no idea of the difficulties.
Sure, sure.
It's all...
Really humiliating.
I only wish my nephew could
be hearing all this.
- Who's that man?
- What man?
- That man in there
- You shouldn't have
opened that door.
- Well who is he?
- Oh, him he doesn't matter.
- Come here.
- What do you mean...
he doesn't matter.
Oh no...I've got to go.
Alright.
These are the backstairs.
You'd better pretend you'd been
waiting on the street.
Say you'd began to feel faint
and you needed some fresh air.
- What's he doing in there?
- Waiting.
He's a client.
Here's your key.
Leni!
Well Josef, well...
Well what?
You know that the nurse
is the advocates mistress?
You're facing a criminal charge.
Do you want to make enemies?
Do you want to lose your case?
Looking for somebody?
What's wrong?
Isn't the court in session?
Not today.
Why isn't the court in session?
- They'll be sitting tomorrow
- You sure?
Sure, my husband
is a guard here.
Guard?
The man who was
kissing you is a...
That wasn't my husband
who was kissing me
that was a law student.
He's just a law student but
even so he's got influence.
Influence, huh?
He's kind of important already.
He must be...
You were making love right there
in the middle of the whole damn crowd.
Ya, I guess we ruined that
speech you were making...
but what could I do about it?
Once he gets started it's...
Hey! You can't touch
those books.
They belong to the
examining magistrate.
It's not my fault
it's the rules.
You do remember me,
don't you?
From last night?
My name is Hilda.
These are probably law books and
of course I mustn't read any law.
I must be condemned
not only in ignorance...
How dirty they are.
Wow, they really are dirty.
And these are the men that
sit in judgement on me.
Listen.
I'll help you.
Wouldn't you like me to?
I don't see how you can if your
husband is a courtroom guard here.
I want to help you that's
why I came in here...
even though,
it's forbidden.
Well, that's very
nice of you...
But I wouldn't want you
to get into any trouble.
No, you mustn't go
away like that...
not yet.
You got the wrong
ideas about me.
Am I such a nothing
in your eyes that
you won't stay just a little
longer when I ask you?
Well I've got plenty of time.
I only came here thinking
the court would
be in session.
You mustn't be offended when I ask you
not to try to do anything about my case.
The truth is, I don't care
at all who it comes out.
And if they sentence me,
I just laugh at them.
Oh, not that it'll ever
come to that.
Or they might make a show
out of carrying it on in
the hope of eventually getting money
out of me, but their wasting their time.
I can tell you that.
There's one thing
you could do for me.
Tell that examining magistrate
of yours that nothing on earth
could ever induce me to give
money to those precious judges.
No.
Ya, but you said the only ones who
could do you any good
were the higher ups.
I'm afraid so.
Still, you could always write
a report and they must go up
to the real authorities.
Last night for instance
when the others had left
he stayed on here,
real late writing away.
He even turned off the mains
and I had to bring in a candle.
Then my husband came home...
and we started to move the
furniture back in place.
Neighbours came in with some beer
and we got to talking by candle light.
And we just forgot about the
examining magistrate altogether.
Then in the middle of the night
I woke up, and there he was.
Standing by our bed shielding
the candle with his hands
to keep the light from
hitting my husband.
Not that he needed to bother. Once my
husband gets to sleep nothing wakes him.
I was so startled
I almost let out a yell
but the magistrate
he was real kind to me.
He whispered he'd been
in there all the time, writing.
and now he'd come in
to return the candle.
And as long as he lived, he told me
he'd never forget the picture I made.
That's what he said.
The picture I made
lying asleep in the bed.
I just tell you this to
show you how busy he is
writing out these
great, long, big reports.
The one last night must've
been about you,
and somebody must read it.
Besides he's starting to
take an interest in me.
So maybe a can do you
some good, huh?
This morning he sent me a pair
of stockings for the law student.
Want to see? I've got them on now.
Look out.
- Is that Bert?
- I know, he's ugly.
Did you get a look at
those legs of his.
Ya.
All the same I've got to
go and be with him now.
I'll come back soon.
And then I'll go with you
wherever you like...
and you can do with me
whatever you want.
What's wrong?
Don't you believe me?
Why should I?
This could be a trap.
- Are you afraid?
- Who is this law student?
A henchman of
the magistrates?
- What of it?
- I...I...
I was thinking
Don't think.
It'd be kind of a nice revenge to
take you away from both of them.
Why not.
Then some night after the magistrate
after he's been staying up late
filling up those long,
lying reports about me.
I'd come to your bedside...
Why don't you go?
You should've left
the minute I came in.
You think so?
That's what you're
supposed to do.
When I come in you get
the hell out of here.
Well...
I seem to detect the insolence of
a future official of the court.
You shouldn't be allowed to
run around like this at large.
That was a mistake,
I told the magistrate.
- Come on.
- Don't try to be funny.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
- No you.
- What do you mean?
He sent for me what
can we do about it.
- Who sent for you?
- The examining magistrate.
- The examining magistrate?
- He's a monster, and this...
ugly monster he
won't let me go.
Sorry, what
can I do?
Now listen...
Leave him alone
you want to ruin me?
He's just obeying the orders
of the examining magistrate.
Alright, alright
take her.
You lied to me
didn't you?
- Why should I lie?
- You're not being...
taken to the
examining magistrate.
- Yes I am.
- You mean to tell me...
that the examining magistrate is
waiting for you in a place like that.
Of course he is, these are
the law court offices.
Where else do think he would be?
Law court offices?
In a place like...
Hell.
You are the defendant?
My name is K.
You're...
the courtroom guard.
Yes, I'm her husband.
It's Sunday night.
I'm not supposed to
work on Sunday night.
But just to get me out of the way
they send me off on these long
useless errands.
That student...
if my job didn't
depend on it
I would have squashed him flat
against the wall here, long ago.
Right there...
just a little bit
above the floor.
All splashed in blood...
with his arms and his fingers
and those bandy legs of his.
all twisted out
and writhing...
like a smashed
cockroach.
He used to carry her
for his own pleasure
but now it's the
examining magistrate's.
Isn't she to blame as well?
She throws herself at him.
And in my position there is
nothing that I can do about it
but if somebody had given
him a good thrashing just once.
He's a coward, you know?
He'd never touch her again.
Only a man like
you could do it.
A man like me?
What do you mean?
- They've arrested you, haven't they?
- Yes.
Well then...
My being under arrest gives me
all that much more...
reason to be afraid of him.
I heard about that
speech of yours.
What about it?
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be afraid at all.
I'm not...I'm not afraid
not of him personally.
I'm not afraid
of any of them.
But he does influence,
or so they say.
He certainly isn't sticking up
for the examining magistrate.
And god knows my case is
prejudiced enough already...
As a rule, none of our
cases are prejudiced.
Well I'm afraid I'd have to
disagree with you about that.
But it wouldn't necessarily stop me
from taking care of that student.
I'd be very grateful
if you would. Come.
Come.
These are the law court offices.
That's where they are
my wife and the magistrate.
I don't have a key...
for this one.
Who are these people?
The accused.
- You, why are you here?
- I'm waiting.
What is it you're
waiting for?
Yes, I handed in several affidavits
that was some time ago.
I'm waiting here for the result.
You certainly seem to be taking a
good deal of trouble over it.
Well yes, you see
it's my case.
I'm under arrest, you don't
see me putting up affidavits.
What makes you think that
kind of thing is necessary?
I can't say exactly but...
I handed in my affidavits.
You don't believe
I'm under arrest.
- Oh yes, certainly.
- Why not? Why don't...
you believe I'm
under arrest?
What do you take me for?
You think I'm a judge?
Back to the seats, all of you!
Keep the passage clear!
Can you tell me how to get out of here.
I've had enough of this place.
You're going already but you've
hardly seen anything yet.
I don't want to...
I just want to get out of here.
Well...
You keep to the right
through that passage
and then you go...
to the second corner
and then left along the
lobby to the fourth.
You'd better show me yourself
there's so many passages and...
lobbies I'll never find the way.
I've got the message to deliver and I've
lost a whole lot of time because of you.
- Come with me.
- Not so loud.
You want to bring all the
officials down on us.
Suppose they ask who you are.
Then you'll have to admit...
you're one of the accused.
- I'm not trying to hide it.
- Well then...
- What do I tell them?
- The truth maybe.
But I only came here because
I wanted to see if the inside
of this famous legal system was as
loathsome as I guessed it was.
And now I'm too depressed to
want to see anything more.
I just want to get out of here
and be alone.
What's wrong?
You feel a little dizzy.
Yes.
Oh, don't worry almost everybody has an
attack like that on their first visit.
It's the air.
That too, and also all sorts of
washing is hung up here to dry.
You can't forbid the tenets
to wash their dirty items.
There's just nothing we can
do about that I'm afraid.
Where are you going?
Do you want me to have
you taken to the sick room.
Please don't...
I'd be fine if I could
just get some air.
It's not far now.
Here's the door right
in front of you.
Why don't you go out?
That's what you wanted.
Yes...
Thank you.
I'm not used
to fresh air.
Hello.
Irmie.
What are you doing here?
- Well I've been looking for you.
- What, why?
Uncle Max I suppose
checking up on me.
He keeps writing, nagging
at me for news.
He hasn't heard a thing about
your case for a long time now.
So naturally, he's worried.
We all are...
Well, tell him not to worry.
Gee, I gotta write something.
Just something...
- Tell him everything is under control.
- But, is it?
- I don't know I...
- I hate to be a...
drag but you know what he's like,
how he carries on about things.
Now it's the honour of the family
and all that jazz.
- Maybe he's right...
- Oh, shit.
Ignore me, I hope you didn't say
what I thought you did.
You shouldn't use that kind of language
Irmie. How old are you anyway?
Sixteen, practically.
You're fifteen,
hardly that.
You certainly shouldn't have
come out here alone.
I wouldn't be here if my cousin hadn't
got himself in trouble with the law.
Don't they check up on
you in that school?
They try to.
You sneak out after hours
is that it?
You're not the only
crook in the family.
- That's not a very funny joke Irmie
- OK, you write home, and say...
what a delinquent I am.
But what do I say about you?
There must be some kind of news.
Well I...
I'm thinking very seriously of getting
rid of your father's old school chum.
You can tell him that.
I can't see that the famous advocate
Hastler is doing anything for me
except encourage the delay.
But he's your lawyer.
How can you get rid of your lawyer?
Easy, just dismiss
him from the case.
And then what?
I don't know.
Isn't there something more definite
I can write home about.
- No, nothing definite.
- You've got to have a lawyer don't you?
Influence, that's all that
counts in the long run.
Hastler is always bragging about
his personal connections...
but what is he
really up to?
Besides, I'm not exactly stupid.
I can defend myself.
Look at the position
I've got at the office.
Don't be surprised if you
hear any day now
that I've become deputy manager
of my entire department.
Well, all I've got to do is to
apply those same abilities...
to this case of mine.
So I get rid of the advocate
I can draw up my own plan
and keep after the
officials myself.
Well, this is where
I leave you Irmie.
You're not going to
work now are you?
Things keep piling up. This case
is taking such a lot of my time.
I've really got to finish
my work somehow...
I don't like to leave you alone. I really
ought to walk you back to your school.
That's all I needed...
to be seen with a man.
But, I'm your cousin.
Cousins get married.
You wouldn't want to
marry the criminal.
Crooks get married too.
- So long now.
- So long Josef.
It's him.
- Who are you?
- My name is Bloch.
- Are you employed here?
- Oh no, I'm only a client.
I don't belong to the house,
I'm just here on business.
- Your shirt sleeves...
- Excuse me, please.
- What have you been doing,
making love to Leni? - No.
No.
Well anyway you don't look
like and honest man.
What did you say your
name was, Bloch?
Yes, Bloch.
- That's your real name?
- Of course, why shouldn't it be?
I don't know you might have
some reason for concealing it.
You know who that is?
Yes, a judge.
- A judge of the high court?
- Oh yes, it must be.
That shows how much you
know about the courts.
Among the judges that's
the lowest of the low.
Oh yes. Yes, of course now I remember
I've been told about that before.
You've been told all about
that before, of course you have.
Yes sir, I have
been told this.
Where is she now?
Come on, where's Leni?
Where's she hiding.
Leni, I don't think she's hiding sir.
She must be in the kitchen.
Yes, that's where
she ought to be.
Yes, she must be in the kitchen
making soup for the advocate.
- Why didn't you tell me that before?
- I was going to take you there sir...
- Don't think you're being clever...
- Oh no, I don't.
I don't think I'm
clever at all.
Lead the way then.
Go on.
Good evening Josef.
Leni...
Who's that man?
His name is Bloch.
You were in your
night gown.
Is he your lover?
I want an answer.
Come to the study and
I'll tell you about it.
No.
No, I want you to
tell me in here.
You aren't jealous
of poor little Bloch?
You can see what he is...
Nothing.
I just have to pay a little
attention to him because
he's one of the advocates
best clients.
You're going to spend
the night with me?
The eggs are burning.
It's just as well eggs
are bad for you.
If you really want to see the advocate
I'll tell him you're here.
He's been asking
after you.
Ya, I'll bet he has.
Where have you
been all this time?
I've got some information
for you too.
Things I've found out...
but first lets get off that jacket.
Shall I announce you
or give him his soup first?
Give him his soup.
He'll need it by the time
I'm through with him.
So you are one of the
advocates clients?
What's it got
to do with you?
You be quiet Rudy.
I'll give him his soup now
but there's a chance
he'll fall asleep right afterwards.
What I have to say to him
will keep him awake.
Just as soon as he's finished
eating I'll announce you.
I want to get you
back with me.
Keep a seat.
So.
You're a...
You're one of the
advocates clients.
Oh yes...
Yes, a very old client indeed.
How long has he had
charge of your affairs.
Affairs?
Business affairs...oh
He's been my representative since...
the very beginning.
But my case...
That's what probably you
are thinking about.
I have it all written down here.
I can give you the exact dates.
Now, it's very difficult to keep
all that in one's head so...
Oh no, I didn't...
I never realized
that Hastler had an ordinary
commercial practise as well.
Of course...
Why... yes you know
that they even say...
They even say that he's a
better advocate for...
business, right, then for...
the other kind.
- Yes?
- Oh ya.
You won't give me away?
I'm not an informer.
He's a revengeful man,
very, very revengeful.
Well surely he wouldn't...
He wouldn't think of harming
one of his own clients.
Yes, Yes!
Yes, once he's aroused
he could do anything.
He doesn't draw
any distinctions.
What was it you
wanted to tell me?
You'll have to tell me
one of your own secrets.
Please.
So we can trust each other.
- Do keep quiet.
- OK, I'll give you something.
I have other advocates.
Other... other advocates
as well as Hastler?
Five of them.
You know...
Hastler...
- Listen...
- Ya.
Hastler...
You notice he's always...
Hastler is always referring to the others
in his own circle as great advocates.
But in the real
protocol of the court.
He ranks where?
- Where?
- Among the smaller advocates.
- Oh sure.
- Hastler?
Well the real great advocates...
- whom I've never seen...
- then you must've been...
- working on your own behalf
- Oh, yes.
Ya know, I'd like to
ask you about that.
- How do you do that?
- It's exhausting.
It's just that they need a court to
try to keep an eye on things and...
too much for one man.
I'll be there often enough
myself after this I suppose.
I can't expect the same special
treatment I got the first time.
Everybody stood up they
must've taken me for a judge.
It was that guard
you were with.
He's the one we
all stood up for.
There's that ridiculous superstition.
What superstition?
you're supposed to be able to
tell from a man's face and from...
the line of his lips especially.
How his case...
is going to turn out.
- So?
- Well, so...
the people were saying that from
the expression on your lips...
They could tell that...
you were found guilty.
Yes, in the very near future.
- The advocate is waiting for you.
- Let him wait.
You can talk to Albert later,
he's sleeping.
Sleeping here?
Everybody isn't like you.
Expecting to be granted an interview
at any hour of the day or night.
And the advocate is
sick as he is too
Your friends do you favours and
you just take them for granted.
Not that I ask for any thanks.
All I want...
well...
I want you to be fond of me.
I'm fond of you.
Well I don't know...
Why shouldn't Hastler
be willing to see me.
He's my lawyer isn't he...
What kind of a favour is that?
- That's not the question.
- He seems to be in a...
state for being difficult.
You know why the advocate
has agreed to see him Leni?
It's because...
His case is still at
the hopeful stage.
Oh yes, Leni.
- He'll see the difference later.
- You talk too much.
That's his trouble.
That's why the advocate can't
bear to see him.
Oh, he does see me occasionally.
But you never know that's
what's so nerve-racking
And you never know when he'll be
willing to receive you.
It could be any time.
Day,night... and if I'm not
right here on the spot
When he does take it into
his head to send for me...
I've lost my chance.
Then I have to wait much
longer than before.
That's why I let you sleep here.
Well I guess...
one gets very dependent on one's
advocate as time goes on.
The truth is,
he likes it.
- Leni...
- Maybe not the waiting.
But you do enjoy spending
the night, now don't you?
Good.
Want to see his home?
OK.
So you sleep in
the maid's room?
Ya, she lets me have it,
yes, it's very convenient.
I'm going to bed.
Mr. K wait.
Wait Mr K!
Rudy.
Mr. K.
Mr.K.
Please...
You forgot your promise...
you were going to tell me
one of your secrets.
Alright, I'll give you a secret.
I'm dismissing the advocate.
- The advocate?
- What?
I'm going to dismiss
him from my case.
- Dismiss him!
- I'm tired of all these delays...
- Please no you can't
- Hastler has done nothing...
he's either too old, too sick
or too indifferent.
- No, he's not indifferent...
- He's dismissing the advocate!
- He's dismissing the advocate!
- Wait!
No Josef...
You stay out.
Leave him alone Leni.
Has she been
pestering you again?
Pestering me?
She finds all accused
men attractive.
It's a peculiarity of hers.
She makes up to all of them...
makes love to all of them.
And when I allow her to...
she tells me about these
affairs to amuse me.
All of them...
You came here this evening
for a specific reason?
Yes, I came here to tell you that
I'm dispensing with your services.
Well, you mustn't be in
too much of a hurry.
I know you've done everything you
can for me and I appreciate it
but I'm afraid that more energetic steps
are gonna have to be taken.
- That's a plan we can discuss.
- It's not a plan, it's a fact.
How many times have I come here
and what have you done for me, nothing.
How many of my clients have reached
the same point in their cases as you,
and stood here before me saying...
exactly the same things.
Maybe they had a reason to
they were probably all...
just as much in the right as I am.
That's true you know...
Accused men...
are attractive.
Not that being accused makes
any immediate change
in a man's personal appearance.
But if you've got the right eye
for these things
you can pick out an accused man
in the largest crowd.
It's just...
something about them,
something...
Attractive
it can't be a
sense of guilt...
You can't all be...
guilty.
Some, of course are more
attractive than others
but all are attractive even that
wretched creature Bloch.
Let's get him in here.
I think it's time you learnt how
other accused men are treated.
Get Bloch in here Leni.
Go and fetch Bloch...
- My decision is final you know?
- You'd better think about it Josef.
The advocate wants to see you.
Go on.
- Is that Bloch?
- Yes sir.
What do you want?
- You were sent for weren't you?
- Yes sir, I was.
- you've come at the wrong time
Sir I came in immediately,
immediately sir...
the minute I heard my name.
- Do you want me to go away?
- You're here aren't you.
Yes sir, I'm here I...
- Then stay.
- Yes sir.
Yesterday, I saw my friend
the third judge.
I managed to work the conversation
around to your case.
My case.
- You want to hear what he said?
- Oh, please.
In these matters there
are so many...
conflicting opinions that the
confusion is impenetrable.
At a certain point...
by an old tradition
a bell must be rung.
- Yes, a bell.
- Shush.
But this marks the official
opening of the proceedings.
There are many arguments against this
opinion but you wouldn't understand them.
- The other advocate...
- No!
- Who is your advocate?
- No..no
- And beside me...
- No sir, no one was...
Then pay no attention
to anyone else.
Fawn on the floor
for him, if you like.
No, you're not to
talk to me like that.
Not in front of the advocate.
How dare you. How dare you!
How dare you!
Don't you see what he's trying to do,
he's trying to humiliate you...
to show off his power.
- Pay no attention to anyone else.
- Let him go!
Do what your conscience
tells you is right.
- Let me go!
- I'm on my knees advocate.
I'm on my knees advocate.
I'm on my knees sir.
I'm on...
How's he been behaving today?
He has been quiet
and hardworking.
What's he been doing all day?
I kept him locked up in the maid's room,
so he wouldn't disturb me when I worked.
It's where he usually stays anyway.
Then you can't say of your own
knowledge what he's been doing.
I peeked in on him now and
then through the ventilator.
He was kneeling all the time
on the bed...
studying the book you
let him borrow.
There wasn't much light so the
way he stuck to his reading
shows that he does
what he's told.
Did he understand what
he was reading?
Well...
he's following the lines
with his fingers.
All I could tell was...
He never goes past the
same page the whole day.
I guess that book is very
hard to understand.
Yes.
The scriptures are very difficult.
They're only meant to give
him a bare inkling of the...
- Yes, yes...
- The complications I must
struggle with in
his behalf.
- Did he read without stopping?
- Almost without stopping...
Once he asked me for a drink of
water and I handed it to him
through the ventilator.
Then about eight-o-clock I let him out
and gave him something to eat.
You're praising him
too much Leni.
You're making it even harder
for me to tell him the truth.
the judges remarks were
by no means favourable.
Not favourable?
How can that be?
He was even annoyed when
I mentioned Bloch's name.
You're wasting your time
with that man he told me.
His case is...
hopeless.
I refused to believe that.
"Bloch is most conscientious",
I told him.
It's true that personally
he's rather repulsive.
His manners are bad
and he's dirty
but as a client, I said,
"He's beyond reproach."
Which was of course a
deliberate exaggeration.
And here's what the judge
replied to that...
"Your, your client has
a kind of low cunning."
"He's learned through the years how
to go on manipulating the situation."
"What do you think he'd say
if we were to tell him
that the bell
marking the start of
the proceedings...
hadn't even
been rung."
Quiet there Bloch.
Have you no shame, to behave
like that in front of a client?
You're destroying his
confidence in me.
What's wrong with you?
You're still alive aren't you?
You're still under my protection.
I hope you realize that I'm
dispensing with your services.
- You can still change
your mind about that.
To be in chains
is sometimes safer
than to be free.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Open the door.
- You must be crazy.
- Open the door.
- There's no place for you to go.
- Listen to him, he's crazy.
I've made up my mind already
that performance in there
would have settled it forever.
I think it was all put
on for my benefit
to win me over.
How far do you think you
could get without him?
How far am I now?
Not far away.
You'd better see him.
- Who the high court judge?
- Don't be funny, of course not.
I mean Titorelli.
He's the official court painter,
he knows them all.
They all come to his studio
to sit for their portraits.
Nobody has more influence
with the judges than Titorelli.
You really think he
could help me?
That's his profession really
as much as painting helping people.
- Unlock the door will you.
- Wait till tomorrow.
- Where are the keys?
The advocate keeps the keys.
OK.
Goodbye Leni and thanks.
- You'll be back here.
- No. No.
You won't have any choice.
No Leni, I've seen what it is
to be one of his clients.
I've seen what happened to Bloch.
He's not a client...
he's the advocate's dog.
- Excuse me is there a Mr. Titorelli?
- Who?
Artist living here.
Do you know the
painter Titorelli?
What do you want him for?
I want him to paint
my portrait.
Your portrait?
Just get in, I'll get
rid of these girls.
Lousy pests!
Out!
Out, I see you.
Don't try your silly games.
He just wants to talk business.
Out! You heard me kids.
Out!
Why don't stay in
somebody else's studio?
Oh, I can see you.
I can see you don't think
you're fooling Titorelli.
Why aren't you out of my studio.
You both best apologize.
You are silly little rascals.
Out.
Out.
Out.
I got home late last night that's why
everything is in such a mess.
And just as I was tucking myself under
the covers a dreadful little claw
reaches up and seizes me.
She was there under the
bed of course waiting.
- Titorelli, can we come in now?
- No, you can't!
- Not even me?
- No.
I know some little pussy cats
who aren't going to be so pretty
when Titorelli is through with them.
Oh, I know some dirty minded
little pussies that are gonna wish
their mom's had drowned
them in a bucket.
I'll get my ice pick.
Remember my ice pick...
And what can I do for you chum?
I thought you might be able
to give me some advice.
You wouldn't want to be
buying one of my pictures?
Oh certainly. You're working
on a painting now?
A portrait,
not quite finished.
It must be a judge.
Judges are my
speciality.
What does that repre...
represent.
You can see for yourself,
justice.
Yes, there's the...
There's the bandage over
the eyes but aren't those
Ouch.
Aren't those wings
there on heels?
My instructions were to
paint it that way.
Why?
Justice ought to stand still don't you
think, or else the scales will waver
and a just verdict
won't be possible.
Actually it's justice and the
goddess of victory combined.
What does she
look like to you?
Like the goddess of the hunt.
In full cry.
Titorelli, came we come in now?
Nasty things,
we're busy.
You aren't really busy.
You're going to paint him?
Please don't paint him,
not another one like that.
These girls belong to the court.
Well actually,
practically everything
belongs to the court.
But it's behind the scenes,
here in this very studio
that's where you
get your results.
I forgot to ask you what kind
of acquittal you want.
Ostensible, or definite acquittal
or deferment?
Definite acquittal is the best but I
can't influence that kind of verdict.
- Nobody can.
- Why?
I've never heard of in my life that
of a case of definite acquittal.
What's wrong sir?
There are windows,
something we can open?
Oh, well there's plenty of air
comes in through those chinks.
And if you want some ventilation you can
open that door just there behind you.
The judge I'm painting now for instance,
he always comes in by that door.
I've had to give him a key for it
in case I have to be out.
His armour usually arrives very early
when I'm still asleep.
It's not exactly a soothing experience
you know to wake up in the morning
and find a judge all dressed up
in those crazy ceremonial robes,
climbing over your bed.
He's taking off his jacket.
They seem to think I'm going
to paint your portrait
and that's why you've
taken off your jacket.
What are the other alternatives?
You mean your
legal alternatives.
I told you ostensible acquittal,
or indefinite deferment.
What's wrong,
not feeling well?
No...
must...
must be the heat.
If I open that door we have
those girls in here all over.
Then don't do that.
Well now with
ostensible acquittal
I write out an affidavit
of your innocence.
And make the rounds off all
the judges I know personally,
beginning with the one
I'm painting now.
I explain to him that you're innocent
and myself guarantee that in...
And if he believes you?
As he very well might.
No, we mustn't be
too pessimistic.
Some of them are
bound to believe me.
Yes, and I'll be free?
Ostensibly...
ostensibly free.
Naturally the judges I know
all belong to the lowest rate.
They haven't the power preserved
to the highest court of all
to grant a final acquittal.
- The highest court?
- Shame that court
is inaccessible to you,
to me, to all of us.
What the prospects
are of the will
we just don't know.
And we don't want to know.
I'm sure you understand.
No, I'm not sure that I do.
Oh, what they can do for you is to
relieve you of the burden of the charge.
Lift it from your
shoulders for a time
but it does hover around
up there above you.
You see, indefinite acquittal
all the documents are annulled.
But with ostensible acquittal your
whole dossier is circulated.
Up to the higher courts,
down to the lower ones,
up again, down.
These oscillations and peregrinations
are just configurable.
No use in trying
either I suppose.
Not a hope.
I've known cases of an acquitted
man coming home from the court
and finding the cops waiting there
to arrest him all over again.
But then of course, theoretically,
it's always possible
to get another ostensible acquittal.
The second acquittal
wouldn't be final either.
It's automatically followed
by the third arrest.
The third acquittal,
by the fourth arrest.
The fourth...
You think a deferment
would suit you any better.
Well I...
couldn't really say.
Even then you can't get
lose a case forever.
Measures have to be taken...
questions, interrogations,
observations, more interrogations,
evidence collected.
Going already?
I'll be...
I'll be back to see
you again, very soon.
I can't keep you to your
word you know Joey.
Otherwise I'll have to
call in at your office
and I know you wouldn't like that.
Unlock this door will you.
You don't want to be
bothered by the girls.
We'd better slip you
out this other way.
- Now wait.
- What for?
Would you like to see
some of my pictures?
I'm sure there's at least one or
two of them you'd want to buy.
Now here,
this one.
It's modern you know,
it's an action painting.
I call it "Wild Nature".
I'll buy it.
Here's the
companion picture.
I'll take them both.
You seem to
like the subject.
Yes, I do.
I'll hang them
in my office.
By a lucky chance I've got another
on the very same thing.
How much for the three?
Oh, we'll settle that
for next time.
Today you're in such a hurry, but
we're gonna keep in real close touch
with each other from now on,
aren't we Joey boy?
This is the law
court office?
That seems to surprise you.
I think what surprises me most is how
ignorant I am about everything
concerning this court of yours.
For an accused man
that's a mistake.
He should never let himself
be caught napping.
Never for a minute let
his eye stray to the left.
When for all he knows that judge,
or somebody like that
can be lurking a
little bit to the right.
You...
I...
I make you very
uncomfortable, don't I?
It distresses you to find
me in your company.
Yes, I've been told about that.
Before I thought you took me for a judge
or at least an official of the court.
I even thought you were afraid of me
but what you're feeling is pain.
You don't like what
you see, do you?
It's my mouth.
You think you can tell
from my mouth
that I'm condemned.
That I'm going to be found guilty.
Guilty.
Josef K!
Josef K!
- You are Josef K?
- Yes.
You're an accused man.
So I've been
informed.
Your case is going badly.
My first petition hasn't
been offered yet.
For the prisons your guilt has
assumed to have been proven.
But I'm not guilty.
For that matter...
How can any man
be called guilty.
We're all simply men here,
one as much as the other.
The guilty always
talk like that.
What do you propose to do now?
Get more help.
Help?
There several possibilities
I haven't explored yet.
You expect too much from outside help,
especially from women.
Women have influence.
Take that examining magistrate,
he has only to see a woman and
he'll climb over the bench and
knock down the defendant
just to get his hands on her.
Ya, that's an aspect of the courts
you probably don't know about.
Where's the door?
I have to catch up on
my work at the office.
After all...
I'm assistant manager
of my department.
What are you
doing in church?
Or am I still in church, or is this
one of the law court offices?
I left my sickbed.
Well or go back
to your sickbed.
Josef, you don't seriously believe
you can defend yourself?
Big choice...
Defend myself
or defy you.
- Defy the court?
- All of you.
What's this?
We use these visual aids.
Lectures and sermons...
Yes, how your particular
delusion is described,
in the writings which
preface the law.
Before the law there stands a guard.
A man comes from the country
seeking admittance to the law.
But the guard cannot admit him.
"Can the man hope to
enter at a later time?"
I've heard it before,
we've all heard it.
The man is dying of old age
still waiting there.
And just at the end the
guard tells him that...
"The door was meant
for him, only for him."
The guard tells him
"No one could enter this door."
"And now, I'm going to close it."
Some commentators have pointed out
that the man came to the door
of his own free will.
Are we supposed to
swallow all that?
- It's all true?
- We needn't accept everything as true,
only what's necessary.
God what a miserable conclusion.
It turns lying into a
universal principle.
By attempting to defy the court,
by such an obviously mad gesture
you hope to plead insanity?
You've laid some foundation
for that claim by appearing
to believe yourself
that you're
victim of some kind
of conspiracy.
That's a symptom of
lunacy isn't it?
Delusions of persecution.
Delusions?
Well...
I don't pretend to
be a martyr, no.
Not even...
a victim of society?
I am a member of society.
Do you think you can persuade
the court that you're not responsible,
by reason of lunacy?
I think that's what the
court wants me to believe.
Yes, that's the conspiracy.
To persuade us all that
the whole world is crazy.
Formless
Meaningless, absurd.
That's the dirty game.
So, I've lost my case.
What of it?
You...
You're losing too.
It's all lost.
Lost...
So what?
Does that sentence the
entire universe to lunacy?
Can't you see anything at all?
Of course I'm responsible.
My son.
I am not your son.
You expect me to take the knife
and do the job myself.
No, you'll have
to do it.
You...
You...
You.
You!
You!
You!
You dummy!
You'll have to do it!
You'll have to kill me!
Come on, come on!
