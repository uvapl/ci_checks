BEYOND SI LENCE
Come on!
Great!
Did you hurt yourself?
It is thundering outside, Daddy.
It's so loud.
It goes BANG! BOOM! BAM!
It's like all hell's been let loose.
<i>Yes, that must have been very loud.</i>
<i>I can just imagine it.</i>
No, Daddy.
That wasn't loud.
Lightning is silent
like the moon.
It's just the thunder
that's noisy.
It's terribly loud.
<i>Ahh, thunder?</i>
<i>What would we do
without you and your ears?</i>
Daddy, you sound like a fish
blubbering through the water.
You're slurping.
The telephone is ringing.
Good morning.
Lara Bischoff speaking.
Hello, Grandma.
It's Grandma.
Her roses are wilting.
Mommy says your apartment is too warm.
You should put aspo...
aspirin into the water.
Are we coming for Christmas?
Sure, we are.
Grandma wants to talk to you.
I think he's already left.
I have to go to school.
Mommy, come here.
Okay, Grandma. Bye.
- "Hello. How are you?"
- "Fine, thanks."
- Good morning, Santa Claus.
- Good morning.
Daddy...
you wanted to enlarge
the poster for the school celebration.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Lara.
- I'm on my way.
- Lara! How are you?
- Fine.
- Does Martin know...
we don't get any
Christmas money this year?
- Is that bad?
- Well... Will you tell him?
If it's bad, tell him yourself.
I have to go to school.
Bye.
"Here, he thought...
is where...
Schatzhauser...
lives.
He took off..."
Lara, that was your homework.
Didn't you practice reading?
Didn't you have time?
Maybe she read it to her dad
and he thought it was great.
There's no getting
around it, Lara.
Reading is important.
If you don't work at home,
you'll have to stay after school.
Do you understand?
Continue reading, Uli,
but with feeling.
With feeling?
"And when he said that,
he was surprised to see..."
<i>How much longer will that take?</i>
<i>We have an appointment at the bank.!</i>
Not now! We have reading now.
That's important.
<i>Yes, learn to read proper.</i>
<i>I'm very proud of you.</i>
What's wrong now, Mommy?
<i>- I'll wait.
- What's wrong?</i>
Bea, what's so funny?
Lara's mother is outside.
What? Again?
This is the last time.
Next time, keep your waiting
out on the green.
"Life is the best teacher,
not school."
Great! Just tell that
to my teacher.
No, sorry.
I can't do anything till March 1.
They committed themselves
for half a year.
The return isn't payable till then.
<i>Ask about the money
we paid into the account.</i>
<i>Can't he give us back any of it?
We need money now.!</i>
<i>He can't, Daddy.
Stop begging.!</i>
<i>Ask him.!</i>
My father says thank you.
He's satisfied with your business.
I'm pleased.
<i>- He says no.
- You didn't ask.!</i>
- Can I help your parents?
- No, thank you.
Right. If I say
it won't work, it won't.
- Shall we go?
- Thank you, Lara.
My parents are your customers,
not me.
<i>Translate what I tell you.!</i>
- I did!
- Would you like some candy?
No, I don't hear anything yet.
"He was...
surprised...
to see..."
Yes, Daddy.
Now I can hear it.
It's nice music, Daddy.
Leave it on.
Okay, I'll keep on reading.
"Behind the thick pine..."
Yoo-hoo! Grandma! Grandpa!
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>I don't remember how she looks...</i>
but she smells like
lilies of the valley and summer.
- Who?
- Clarissa.
When are they going to be here?
Robert is probably about to explode.
I really envy you.
You speak that magic tongue
as if it were a game.
If I hadn't listened to that pighead,
my hands might be able to fly too.
Will you help me set the table?
Hello, Clarissa and Gregor.
Hi, dear. Merry Christmas, you two.
How nice you're here.
I only came for the goose.
We're having roast goose, aren't we?
These belong in the living room.
I thought they belonged
in the attic.
- How has it been so far?
- Peaceful, and I hope it stays that way.
- Sure. It's Christmas.
- Exactly.
Why are you so late?
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- Merry Christmas.
Martin.
It's freezing outside!
And I forgot my blanket in heaven.
What do I see?
Nothing but old people!
Aren't there any...
What do you call those little...
Children!
Aren't there any in here?
You naughty girl!
I know who you are.
You aren't Santa Claus.
If you say that,
you won't get any presents.
Who am I?
Uncle Gregor...
No! Santa Claus!
You good little girl.
All of these things are...
for you!
Does it taste good?
I didn't know what to buy.
Take it.
I know that you can use it.
- Who gave you that nice book?
- Daddy.
- Lara, come here.
- Okay, Grandma.
- We'll read it later.
- Shall we play the piece from last year?
- What should I do?
- You can collect the napkins.
<i>I thought we'd read the book.</i>
Wait till Clarissa
is finished playing.
<i>Use your hands
when you talk to me.!</i>
Wonderful, you two.
Do you talk to the baby?
Sounds are very important
for babies.
- Is that right, Grandma?
- That's right.
Don't you want
to spend the night here?
Oh, yes! Please!
You'd need at least an hour
to drive home in this weather.
Don't cheat.
Here, this is for you.
What is it?
My first one.
I learned to play on it.
- Do you want it?
- Thank you, Clarissa.
Look. You press your lower lip
against your teeth.
Hey, you're talented.
Lara! Where are you?
- I have to go.
- Stay a while.
- I'll drive you home tomorrow.
- Oh, yes.
Ask her.
Clarissa wants me
to stay a while. May I?
She'll drive me home tomorrow.
Okay?
Look. This is my favorite color.
Mommy never puts on makeup.
When I was your age,
my hair was this short.
- Should I cut yours?
- No.
It would be pretty.
Okay, okay!
I won't do anything you don't want.
You see...
that was my haircut.
- Is that Dad?
- Yes.
That's us about 20 years ago.
Look at Grandma.
- You didn't like him?
- Who do you mean?
Martin?
Did he say that?
That's wrong.
When we were young,
we were very close.
And then?
You know your father.
He can really be stubborn sometimes.
Your grandma always took his side.
He could do everything.
On his 15th birthday...
he knocked all the cups
and plates off the table.
And Grandma didn't even
bat an eyelid.
He was always her favorite.
I never had a chance.
But you never learned his language.
Yes, I did. A bit.
As kids, we made up
our own sign language.
But the doctors said
it was a mistake...
that sign language apparently
kept him from learning to speak.
You look pretty in that dress.
Well, what do you say?
Shall I cut it off?
Don't be afraid.
I'll make you look beautiful.
<i>I told you to come this afternoon.</i>
<i>What happened to you?</i>
<i>Why are you crying?</i>
<i>Now you look like her.</i>
<i>That's what you wanted, right?</i>
<i>We're stuck together.</i>
Let me go!
Hey, Daddy! Let me go!
Mommy, why can't you ride a bike?
You have a bad sense of balance
because of your ears.
I want you to learn how.
Every real mother can ride a bike.
When the baby's born. Promise?
Hey, you in there,
don't be afraid.
Out here, life
isn't completely quiet.
When you come, I'll be here, and I'll
play a song for you on my new clarinet.
How often have I told you?
The cellos are too high.
Mr. Gartner!
Not now! We're rehearsing!
The flute players don't listen!
Frau Mertens sent me down.
I play the clarinet.
- Can you read notes?
- She can't even read any books!
Come over here.
Some things take time.
I haven't given up hope yet...
that you'll master the triangle
by the next parents' evening.
C-D-F-G.
Wonderful.
Now hold the last tone.
Great.
Now from the beginning again.
"Does Good Claus Do Fun Games."
I didn't want to learn poems.
My homework?
I don't have any.
I'm not wasting time.
Mrs. Mertens said I've gotten better.
What are you doing?
Give me back my clarinet!
What? Music keeps me
from learning?
Nonsense! Learning
isn't more important!
You don't know what's important!
You're deaf!
You don't even know
what music is!
You're mean!
You never cared about my schoolwork.
Neither you nor Mommy did!
You just don't want me
to play the clarinet!
I hate you!
<i>I'm going to lose her.</i>
<i>Only if you make the same mistake
your parents did.</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>Accept her for what she is.</i>
<i>She can hear,
and we are deaf.</i>
<i>She is my child.</i>
<i>But she doesn't belong to you.</i>
Still so long?
Anyway I stay
here so long
I'll stay here with you
till the baby comes.
Yes, they make a sound.
They sound like bells.
The more wind there is,
the louder they ring.
Were you happy too
when Clarissa was born?
At first. And then?
Didn't you ever play together
when you were my age?
Why?
When Clarissa was nine or ten...
she gave her first concert
in front of a large audience.
Grandpa had invited
lots of important people.
I think it was
his 50th birthday.
Everyone was very excited
on that day.
Clarissa had to play
several pieces on the clarinet.
She had practiced them
for a long time.
Grandpa was very proud
of his daughter.
From then on, she never played again
when I was in the room...
and so I spent many evenings
alone in my room.
I have this from a friend
who teaches at a high school.
It may be a bit difficult,
but try it.
This is your first music
with triplets.
When you reach this point,
count to yourself: 1, 2, 3...
- That fast?
- No.
As fast as you can.
Since everything is in G major...
So this is F sharp.
1, 2, 3.
Next year we'll look for a
private teacher for you
Do you want me to speak
with your parents about it?
Better nicht. Right now
they are busy with our baby.
Do you go to Uli's
birthday party?
Why not?
Because I'm not invited.
Don't worry, Lara.
The raven fly in a swarm
But the eagle...
...flies alone.
Don't whine.
It has to be.
You want to look fine,
don't you?
Hey, Mommy! Don't!
Don't, Mommy!
I wanted to read her a story.
I'm supposed to talk to her a lot.
Oh, yeah?
How do you know she's tired?
Did she tell you that?
Okay.
Marie? Can you hear that?
Hey, you can hear!
She can hear!
Marie, you can hear!
<i>But why are you suffering?</i>
<i>No, everything is different.</i>
<i>I'm not like I used to be.</i>
<i>But there's one thing
you have to know.</i>
<i>You love me.
You know you love me.</i>
<i>Yes, yes.</i>
<i>Look at me, Maria.
We have our whole lives ahead of us.</i>
<i>You and me.</i>
<i>Nothing can come between us.</i>
<i>From now on,
we'll always stay together.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
A bike ride?
But you don't know how, Mommy.
Except for the triangle,
everything was quite nice.
- I'm not so good at music.
- You don't say!
And if the trumpet player
would kindly remove his chewing gum...
It's nice that you've come.
Lara is a wonderful pupil, you see...
but she won't be able to pass...
unless she improves
her reading and writing.
<i>My reading is improving,
but it isn't perfect yet.</i>
And we can't always allow her
to leave class early.
<i>Tell her we're happy that she
lets you leave class early sometimes.</i>
Are you finished yet?
<i>It's difficult to find
a good translator here.</i>
It's summer vacation soon.
Then I won't have to leave early.
That's my last word on the matter!
Next time, I won't let you go.
<i>You're a wonderful teacher.
Lara really likes you.</i>
She says you're quite nice.
- They're pretty. Thank you.
- At last!
I finally get to meet you!
Your daughter is extremely talented.
For the parents' evening, I've reserved
two seats for you in the first row.
Okay?
<i>This is my music teacher.</i>
<i>He says it's a shame that you never
allow me to play the clarinet.</i>
We have to pick up our baby.
Any more questions?
Lara, you told them
how worried I am?
I told them everything...
not word for word, but more or less.
The easiest note is G.
No fingers. Look!
But I never get to play it.
Maybe it's too simple
for them to use.
I did it on the bus.
There's more I have to read...
but I can do it tomorrow.
Are you going tomorrow?
Of course, the baby.
"The sun resounds
in age-old fashion...
in brotherly spheres
of rival calls...
completing its appointed action...
by rendering up its thundersqualls.
The sight of it
gives angels strength...
though its wisdom
is never proclaimed.
These works
of baffling magnificence...
dazzle as if they'd just been made."
It's your turn.
Is everything okay?
You'll do a good job.
You'll play very, very well.
And now Lara Bischoff
from Class 3C.
She'll play a piece on the clarinet.
It's absolutely the best school.
Students come from all over the world.
What do you think?
It's a question of Lara's future.
You want to take away
my only talented student?
That's not very funny.
She has to develop her talent,
and you can't become anything here.
- That's right.
- I'm not so sure. Berlin?
I'd have to rent a room.
That's too expensive.
There are other ways.
You think Dad
would take your money?
It isn't for him,
it's for you.
- I could write a recommendation.
- Music isn't that important to me.
If you don't accept that offer,
you'll be missing your big chance.
You can't look after your parents
your whole life!
You show up once a year,
and every time you have a new idea.
- Sometimes I think you're just bored.
- Exactly.
Here's my final offer:
Spend the summer with us,
and we'll practice every day.
All summer long
we'll practice and go to concerts...
and see if you can pass
the entrance exam.
- Would you like to?
- May I come along?
You know I'd like to.
You can't imagine how boring it is
all day with your uncle.
Look!
What about Marie?
Can't she make calls for you?
Okay, I'll be right there.
I got something to drink
with some girlfriends.
Sure, I'll bring them along sometime.
I have to make some calls for Mom.
<i>You see this beautiful night?</i>
<i>Take a good look.</i>
<i>Things change quickly.</i>
<i>Spring will begin soon.</i>
<i>The snow will melt.</i>
<i>How does snow sound?</i>
<i>What does it say to you?</i>
It says, "Crunch, crunch, brr, brr."
<i>What are "crunch"and "brr"?
What kind of words are they?</i>
To tell the truth,
snow doesn't say much.
It's even said that snow
swallows every sound.
When snow is on the ground,
everything is much quieter.
<i>Honest?</i>
<i>Snow makes the world quiet?</i>
<i>That's beautiful.</i>
Clarissa was at school today.
I didn't know she was here myself.
It's her birthday soon.
Grandpa wants to take us all to dinner.
Won't you come with us, please?
For my sake.
- Hey, you pig!
- It's only chocolate.
- Before dinner?
- Bettina treated me.
Bettina's sleeping over.
Her parents aren't home.
- Can we use your clarinet?
- By no means!
Why not?
Afraid I'll break it?
Have you set the table yet?
Let me show Bettina! Please!
Stop it! You won't get it!
If you're bored,
you can help Mom in the kitchen.
I don't want your stupid stick!
Your music gets on
everybody's nerves anyway!
Do you hear that?
So is it all day.
I cannot stand this
thing any more
Come.
Do it, now!
Ouch, Mommy! Ouch! Help!
Nothing.
Louder! Come on, hurry up!
Ouch! Mommy! Help!
Marie, did you hurt yourself?
What's the big idea?
Bettina thought that
maybe our parents aren't deaf.
Maybe they're spies
who were sent here to observe us.
We just tested Mommy.
Are you nuts?
- Aren't you ashamed?
- What for?
She thinks it's funny. She also
made up crazy stuff when she was little.
See? She thinks it was
nothing bad
You have to be always angry.
Go and play your stupid clarinet
Be happy to have ears, so you
can hear the stupid clarinet.
Dad can't hear, and he also
hates your music.
I can move out if you don't like it.
Then you'll see what you do.
How's your work with children going?
I think I'll stop teaching.
But that Keller girl
really improved with you.
Her family moved to Frankfurt
a month ago.
The others aren't really interested.
That's boring.
What do you think about it, Gregor?
Me? Yes, of course she's talented.
The kids are crazy about her,
but if she doesn't want to...
Don't let the pleasure principle
run your life!
You have to do something
besides spending your husband's money!
That isn't fair.
I've always earned my living.
Sure, but how?
Sorry I didn't meet
your expectations, Dad.
Money is not the subject here.
Stop all the arguing, will you!
After all,
it's Clarissa's birthday.
"After all, it's Christmas!"
It's not my fault
we only see each other on holidays!
But we don't have to speak
always about the same things
What should we talk about, then?
- ¿Talk? This is humiliate. - ¿Humiliate?
- Excuse me... could you bring the cake?
If you had kids or a family...
What do you do all day?
- She cleans up.
- Exactly.
You clean up, huh?
She'll have enough to do
when Lara comes for the summer.
- Marie!
- What?
- Lara is staying with you?
- You haven't told them yet?
Excuse me... I thought
it was already decided
What are you talking about anyway?
Don't keep us in suspense.
¿All this secret-playing?
- What hasn't Lara told us?
- I would prefer to tell them myself.
You're afraid to.
Lara is spending the summer with me.
I'm preparing her
for the entrance exam...
and if all goes well, she'll attend
the conservatory in the fall.
Berlin?
Isn't there anything nearby?
That's a good idea.
Lara's talent should be developed.
Perhaps she'll
make something of herself.
But Berlin is far away.
You'd have to live there.
You want to move out?
Lara is 18.
There's a time for everyone.
It won't work
if Martin and Kai don't approve.
Do you have to stab me in the back?
Stab you in the back?
I'm happy I can say anything
in this family.
Leave her alone.
She's a wonderful clarinet player...
and I want to help her.
We'll pay for it.
Don't worry.
She has to get out of that nest.
She's looked after you long enough!
- Stop it, Clarissa!
- Why?
That school is just right for her.
And you can visit her if you like.
But we wanted to go to Italy
this summer.
This is more important.
Martin and Kai have to approve.
Lara shouldn't be handicapped
just because her parents are!
I'm the father!
She is my daughter!
Sit down!
Clarissa, you went too far this time!
Sure, it's all my fault again.
He throws red wine in my face,
and you stand up for him!
I wanted to tell you this evening,
but Clarissa told you first.
Nothing is decided yet.
Clarissa wants me to apply
for the exam. That's all!
She only wants to help me.
She isn't conceited.
That's nonsense!
Do you think you and Mom
can get along without me?
I treat you like a baby.
I can leave if I want to.
Then what's the reason?
<i>I ruined their evening again.</i>
<i>They felt ashamed for me,
as always.</i>
Who cares?
It isn't important.
<i>Why Clarissa, of all people?
Don't you know how much it hurts me?</i>
I want to become a musician.
That's all.
Try to understand me.
<i>Sometimes I wish you were deaf.</i>
<i>Then you'd be totally in my world.</i>
It's mean that you're leaving. Now I
have to translate all of Mom's movies.
Stop whining!
You don't help out much anyway.
Can I at least sleep in your bed
while you're gone?
If it makes you happy.
Yes, it does.
And don't touch my teddy bear.
Why do parents
only talk about homework?
When I was little, I believed
that all grown-ups could sing.
I also thought I'd be able to
when I was a grown-up.
I'd stand in front of a mirror
and move my mouth...
and pretend that wonderful sounds
were coming out...
sounds that made people look
so ecstatic, so happy... music!
I danced in front of the mirror and held
a brush as if it were a microphone.
What's this, Mom?
You don't know if I like this music.
It's a clarinet concert.
You read about it in the newspaper.
I'm sure it will be very good.
But why two tickets?
We'll have a nice evening.
It's wonderful you're coming along.
Thank you.
- It's nice you're here.
- Why didn't Clarissa come?
She isn't feeling so well
this morning.
Nothing serious.
She perks up after dark.
Do you know what time is it?
Lara!
You have finally arrived!
Come on!
Out of that bed!
- I want to see the city!
- To see the city?
Yes. Now you have me here.
And I want to see the city
See the city?
Do you know how large the city is?
- Hello, Clarisssa
- Hello. This is my niece, Lara
Christian, Frederick, Wolfgang,
Anna, Babs, Susanne and Walter.
- Hello.
- Are you visiting in Berlin?
She wants to go to the conservatory, but
she has to get used to the city first.
- You're a musician?
- Not yet.
She plays the clarinet very well.
And now you want to see Berlin?
Lara, come here!
- This is my lake.
- Right in the middle of town!
It's the only place
that makes me feel melancholy.
It always reminds me of home.
It froze over last winter.
What if somebody comes?
Well?
I don't like melancholy stuff. They ruin
my mood for the rest of the day.
Don't worry.
I'll find you some nice pieces.
I don't know if I want to play
anything else. I like the music.
- But you won't get accepted with that.
- Who says?
I do. Or are you keen on depressing
the examiners to death?
I think they should accept you.
This is ridiculous.
The greatest composers...
Either believe me, or try it alone.
<i>A stupid feeling
being stared at, huh?</i>
<i>I've been watching you.</i>
<i>I noticed.</i>
<i>Hello. I'm Johanna.
Who are you?</i>
<i>L-a-r-a.</i>
<i>T-o-m.</i>
<i>We're going to the park, but he let me
take a quick look in here.</i>
<i>Right. And "quick"is almost over.</i>
- Can I help you?
- We'd like those gloves.
Aren't you deaf?
Not me. You?
- How much?
- Five marks. What do you want?
My father's deaf.
He raised me all by himself.
And now I'm a teacher
at a school for the deaf.
We were actually supposed to work
on articulation today.
And you?
¿How do you speak the language so well?
It's a similar story.
My parents...
Watch out... right...
- I'll bring Johanna home.
Do you come with us? - Ok.
In two months, I'll be gone anyway.
I'm going to the Gallaudet School
in Washington for a semester.
The deaf can study medicine,
art history, law...
all in sign language.
Americans recognize it as a language.
They're at least 20 years ahead of us.
I always wanted a father
I could be proud of...
one who protected me from the world
and sang me to sleep every night.
One who can't understand why you like
Guns 'n Roses more than Beethoven.
Exactly.
- 6:30. I have to go.
- 6:30. That's very late!
You can come visit me at school.
I'm there every day.
Perhaps.
- I thought I'd visit you.
- This is Lara.
She came for a visit.
She may become a teacher too.
- Lie down.
- What should I do?
Lie down on the floor
on your stomach.
Or don't you want to take part?
Okay.
Wait and close your eyes.
Poor Lara.
I'm afraid she can't feel the music.
Will you go to the movies
with me tomorrow?
"At The Lake! Come And Join Me."
Clarissa?
Lara, go in, come on!
The water is wonderful...
I brought no secure bag...
So what? Come on in!
Aren't you afraid,
here at night...?
The first to arrive at the buoy...!
Where did Gregor drive off to?
He's looking for an apartment.
He said he gets a toothache
from my music.
- They're all against us.
- Every one of them.
Why didn't you and Gregor
have a baby?
I don't know whose fault it was.
It never worked out.
Maybe Mother Nature didn't want
to entrust a baby to a mother like me.
I did everything wrong.
Martin has you, Kai,
Marie and a real home.
I have nothing.
That's not true.
You have so much. You're pretty and
strong, and you make wonderful music.
I always wanted to be like you.
It was a nice movie, wasn't it?
- Didn't you like it?
- Movies like that somehow make me sad.
Love stories with a happy ending
make you sad?
Yeah.
They make me unhappy with what I have.
I mean, they make you so hopeful.
Hope is a widespread evil.
You have to be careful with your dreams.
Most of them never come true.
Why so serious? You're not even 20
and talk like Mrs. Kowalschek.
- Who?
- My caretaker.
But she's 70, fat and ugly
and sits at the window with her poodle.
- Isn't there anything nice in your life?
- Very little.
You're making me crazy,
you ungrateful creature!
Don't feel so sorry for yourself!
But I'm hungry.
- I want a schnitzel!
- What? A schnitzel!
- Two schnitzels, please.
- I don't have any money.
It's on me.
- Would you like ketchup on it?
- No, thank you.
Gloria Gaynor!
I loved it when I was 14.
Come here.
Come closer.
Your mother had an accident
on her bike yesterday.
She's dead.
There's no sound, Dad.
It's soundless.
It was a mistake for her
to ride a bike.
She had problems
with her sense of balance.
Are you trying to say it's my fault?
Look at me!
Talk to me, damn it!
You don't believe that!
What should I do?
The music bothers you.
You don't want any music in your house?
In your house?
I'm sure I won't be home later
than 11:00 if the bus is on time. Okay?
- Do you have to go?
- Yes. I haven't been out for months.
And I'm about to go crazy.
Anyway, the tickets are from Mom.
Why can't I go with you?
You have two.
Someone has to stay with Dad.
You have to put him to bed.
He can put himself to bed.
I'm not his baby-sitter.
Watch it, miss. Don't get cheeky.
- How do I look?
- Too flashy.
- Really? Clarissa uses makeup too.
- Clarissa is good-looking.
I love you.
You know that, don't you?
Jora, hurry up! The concert
is about to begin!
Tom?
What are you doing here?
You rode past me on the bus.
I wanted to see how you're doing.
Your aunt told me that...
I'm flying tomorrow evening.
I'm very sorry...
I just heard a wonderful concert.
I have to get into that school.
I just have to.
Do you think I'm good enough?
- I've never heard you play.
- Shall I play for you now?
- Now?
- Why not?
There must be some advantage
in having deaf fathers.
- Well, you're in a good mood again.
- Shhh... my sister does hear everything.
- Don't you need a light for the notes?
- I have everything in my head.
Don't judge me too harshly.
I just made this piece up.
Did you know that they are deaf?
Really, teacher?
But they can feel the sounds through
their sinn...
Right now it hears your heart beat
Can I stay in your apartment?
I have to prepare myself for the exam.
- And I want to leave here.
- I've rented it to a friend.
I can't let him down.
Hey. What's wrong with you?
Little Lara,
why are you so terribly sad?
The saddest things in life
are separations and deaths.
I don't want to say good-bye anymore.
I've had enough of that.
You aren't rid of me yet.
Our story's just beginning.
What a great couple... a clarinet player
and a teacher for the deaf.
I don't want you to go.
I'm almost back.
- Where were you?
- I was out walking.
- Aren't you a bit late?
- What? It's only 7:15.
Was the concert nice?
Yes. Around 12:00, I think.
So what? I wasn't home by 11:00.
But I'm 18, and I can be
an hour late if I want.
You're allowed to do some things,
but not everything. Hey, what's up?
But he won't allow you...
to bring men home
to the living room.
Who was here?
What did I do wrong this time, Dad?
What do you hold against me?
That I'm irresponsible?
That I'm egotistic...
and that I only think of myself
and my music?
That I stabbed you and Mom in the back?
That I'm on Clarissa's side?
Let me tell you something.
I can't stand it here...
your silent, reproachful looks,
your complaints.
The silence here, the noise you make
when you read the paper...
when you eat,
when you brush your teeth.
This house is like a cage.
Get out of here!
I've had enough!
Yes?
I'm looking for my aunt...
Clarissa Bischoff. Is she here?
What are you doing here?
Come in.
Walter is photographer.
He'll make some photos for a
travel magazine in Spain.
I'll help him.
Something like his assistant
We travel next week.
Ah... and Gregor?
Your uncle has chosen to live alone.
You did the right thing.
Your music is more important.
Martin will understand.
But he's always been the same.
He acts like crazy
and we end feeling bad ourselves
You have no idea what he
is like.
- What's wrong now?
- You have no right to condemn him.
You never even tried
to understand him.
Lara, I want you to be free...
What do you really want from me?
Sometimes I think you want me
to study at that school for your sake.
Your problems only distract you
from your music.
Sure. You want me to be good,
but not better than you.
That's not fair.
That's why you oppose my music.
You think it's boring, depressing.
If you were really interested, you would
have encouraged me, but you never did.
Slow down, ladies.
No need to get excited.
Shut up! You have no idea
what we're talking about!
Coffee?
Just like your father.
- Now I see what you're really like.
- Exactly.
I'm my father's child
and not the daughter you never had.
And most of all, I'm not you.
My publishing company is over there.
You can sleep here.
Sleep tight.
My deadline is next month.
The publisher is impatient.
- I'll only practice when you're gone.
- Practice whenever you want.
After 12 years with your aunt,
I can sleep no matter how noisy it is.
Do you regret having moved out?
Not really.
But maybe I will.
Why did you leave?
Clarissa has no need for me.
Her mind is filled with you,
Robert and Martin.
But they always argue.
Yet, I wish she had
loved me as much.
Her damned health food got on my nerves
too. Everything's green in her fridge.
I don't eat anything that's green,
besides chewing gum.
Yes?
Marie! Where are you?
Very near. Downtown.
Can you pick me up?
- I don't know what subway to take.
- Are you alone?
Yes.
My goodness.
Are you out of your mind?
Alone by train?
- Why are you here anyway?
- To visit you.
That's why you went 300 miles by train?
But I have no time.
- Does Dad know you're here?
- Sure. I wrote him a note.
What did you write?
That I was going to a party
after school...
but I didn't write that the party
was 300 miles away.
- What does he say?
- About what?
You know.
Does he talk about me?
I don't think what you said
was so nice either.
Oh, shut up.
You don't have to tell me that too.
Can you come back soon, please?
- The exam is in a few days.
- And how do I get back home?
What? Don't you have a return ticket?
I used up all my money.
And it's gonna be night soon.
And I'm only nine.
Oh, shit.
There's a problem sleeping here.
Come here and you'll see.
We need your help.
Yes, a family affair.
The tank is full.
I filled up yesterday.
Are you good?
Sure.
- It goes 140 miles per hour?
- But drive carefully.
See you tomorrow.
Take care, Marie. Say hi to Martin.
<i>Other fathers are proud
of their daughters...</i>
<i>when they're successful.</i>
<i>Why don't you help me?</i>
You can't let me go in there alone.
Daddy will tear me apart.
I drove you here. Now you walk
the last ten yards yourself.
- Please.
- Go on. He'll be happy you're back.
I drove Marie home.
<i>Thank you.</i>
Hey! Since when does Clarissa
know our language?
<i>Is Lara still at your place?
Is she all right?</i>
No, she's sad.
She misses you.
Come on. I'll take you to her.
<i>Why didn't she come with you?</i>
She doesn't have the time.
You have to go to her.
Oh, yes! We'll all go
right back there together!
<i>No, I can't.</i>
Stop feeling sorry for yourself!
<i>It must be a family problem.</i>
Oh, Daddy!
Why didn't you go there with her?
<i>If you ever run away again...</i>
<i>I'll spank the living daylights
out of you.</i>
ENTRANCE EXAM
- Which instrument?
- Clarinet.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Lara Bischoff.
Come with me, please.
Miss Bischoff...
in your application, you wrote you're
interested in traditional Idezmer music.
- Why are you interested in it?
- That's hard to say. It's a feeling...
Perhaps because it's so emotional.
Emotional? Well, well.
Inside it's joyful and wild,
and at the same time...
it's sad and not really free.
It's a feeling I understand
very well.
Do you know what I mean?
Then let's begin
with your main subject.
Miss Bischoff,
you've brought along three pieces?
Yes. If you don't object,
I'll begin with the contemporary piece.
As you wish.
The order is unimportant.
<i>I want to see you play.
Is that okay?</i>
We're waiting.
Don't you feel well?
Would you like some water?
Take a deep breath.
Then begin.
It's not as bad as you think.
<i>Calm down.
I just want to wish you luck.</i>
What's going on?
Why did you come?
<i>To see what's so important to you...</i>
<i>and to see how you play.</i>
- Excuse me. Would you let us in on this?
- Yes.
That's my father. He's deaf.
He'd like to watch.
All right. If he'd like to.
But I must ask you to begin.
<i>That's right.! Show them.!</i>
Please, Dad. Stop talking.
I'm getting all mixed up.
<i>So that's your music?</i>
Yes, it's my music.
Do you think you'll ever
be able to understand it?
<i>Maybe I can't hear it...</i>
<i>but I'll try to "understand"it.</i>
<i>Have I lost you?</i>
I've loved you
ever since I was born.
You'll never lose me.
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>
