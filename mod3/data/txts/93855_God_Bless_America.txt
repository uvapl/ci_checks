I'm Robbie Barkley.
This is Hollywood extreme.
And yet a young man
accusing Michael Jackson
of having been sexually molested
at Neverland Ranch.
Can not they leave him alone!
Michael just wanted to make others happy.
People do not know what happened.
They were not there.
They're just haters.
I hate those who vilify Michael.
I hate haters!
-I hate my neighbors.
Their constant idiocy
that pours out from their apartment.
Is devastating.
I called him retarded
and slapped his face.
It does not matter how polite
I ask them to be polite.
They are unable to understand
that their actions affect others.
They have a complete lack of caring.
And an over-developed
sense of entitlement.
They have no decency,
do not care and are without shame.
They do not care if I suffer from
migraines and insomnia.
They do not care that I have to work.
Or that I want to kill them.
I know it is not normal
to want to kill them.
But I am no longer normal.
I hate that kid.
I hate the kid's fat stupid face.
Hey dude, what's wrong?
A lot.
-Take it easy dude.
I'm not your buddy.
Do not shoot! I have a child!
It is the craziest ring
ever, texting only P in G. ..
The controversial pastor A. Goren
is back with his followers.
And the protest
a cancer victims burial.
God hates fags! God hates fags!
Velocitea,
that shows in your face.
Here's second in Tough Gurlz.
Listen here you fucking slut,
belittle me!
Upholstered you crap in my food?
What, what?
Your slut!
I think she is a traitor.
Just because she lost her
son in the war, she has no right to-
be disrespectful to all of our brave
sons and daughters who serve our country.
Honestly, her son
are better off dead.
For now do not he see what
fool his mother has become.
And before you criticize me
to be heartless.
There are three things I love: my mother,
my country and those who serve our country.
That's all for Fuller Talk.
Order your Fuller enabled products ...
Boys captured
after setting fire to a homeless person.
And then posted video clips
with the attack on the net.
Oh, shit.
Are you okay?
We have a media that allows him
get away because he is black.
So he will not work as the rest of us
within the law.
It's the world we live in.
What is your name?
-Steven Clark.
What will you sing, Steven Clark?
I shall stop here.
Ok stop, just stop.
Please!
You're kidding, right?
You're wasting our time, Steven.
What are you doing? Stop bow!
Just stop everything and listen.
Do you have mental problems?
-No.
Go and get some psychiatric help.
-See you in Hollywood.
He also killed his wife and mother.
A total of 16 dead and 33 wounded.
All on one tragic afternoon.
A former choirboy
and Boy Scout.
He climbed
Texas University's clock tower 1966th
With a sniper-rifle
and military training.
He became America's first
school massacre killers.
Meet Steven Clark, the newest
star from America's Super Stars.
If you missed the program,
Perhaps you want to put in earplugs now.
Ok, stop now!
It was the best in the entire program.
I know, I feel really bad that
laughs, but it is so funny.
Good morning.
Yes?
You have blocked my car again.
-It is your own fault, dude.
Ok, you can move your car?
I'm a bit late.
Now?
-Yes.
Say that he will not park
next to us.
Okay then ... Dude, you need
give yourself more room.
40% of adult Americans can not
reading greater than a fourth-level.
When high schoolers asked
what they wanted to be an American.
Answered most of the girls:
Kim Kardashian.
And the boys responded:
The men in the soap Jersey Shore.
I'm really late, Ed.
Can you even manage to
park your damn car.
If he plays this well with a testicular
Maybe the whole gang should get cancer.
For all the angry letters to the E-man.
Ok, I'm a villain eh?
I'm just saying what you already think.
It is not your father's sports show.
My favorite part of America's Super Stars
is when the backward occurs.
You get access behind the scene.
You just take her to the breast.
How long have you been working here
and thinning out can not be unsightly girls-?
We want to see blood, tears
and one of your whores excluded.
Turn her on her misshapen tutte.
-Hi.
What's up? You called.
When should I pick Eve?
Eva says she does not want to greet you.
-It must be she.
Frank, I can not force her.
-Yes you can, you're the adult.
I can talk to her.
-Ok.
Eva, it's your dad.
-I am doing something important.
-Why do not you pause?
But I'm almost to the next level.
Pause now.
-Hi, Dad.
Hey, it will be fun to visit?
I want to stay with mom.
-Why?
There's nothing to do with you.
What do you mean? We have for a lot.
Playing in the park, go to the zoo, make art.
-It is sad with you!
You should come and see me.
Do you have a gift for me?
-No.
-Hi.
Where was she from?
She only gave back the handset.
She would have had to move from town.
-She did not visit you before, either.
Try to get her out of it.
-Goodbye.
Are we done?
-No, wait.
I do not know if I've said it but,
Brad and I are getting married.
Tell Brad that when he's down there
he can smell my balls.
Frank says hello.
-Say hello back.
Alison get her to come, ok?
It means everything to me.
Frank, I'll try.
Do not be such a drama diva.
Drama-diva, drama diva
Dad is a drama diva.
Ok, thanks.
Hi Karen.
-Hi.
This is the book I told you about.
-Thank you.
If he plays this well with a testicular
Maybe the whole gang should get cancer.
It sat, boss.
I'm just saying what you already think.
Oh, I feel so sorry for him.
Is this for real?
Yes he is for real,
he was on the Fat Boy in the morning.
Yes it's real, real bad.
-Oh, you're really unlucky.
I think he is good.
... Not.
-Oh, you scared me.
What about you Frank. Did you freak
of America's Super Stars last night?
What?
I will go. Freak on
America's Super Stars.
Well, I happened to see him.
But I see not America's Super Stars.
You do not see it but you saw.
What? Are you too nice to see it?
Yes, I'm too good for a program
that makes stars out of untalented.
So you can not say,
some of them have talent.
No. They have a good voice, are clean,
not threatening the little girls and old men.
They have the ability to stand in line with other
desperate confused people.
But I guarantee you.
They are without talent.
And 32 million said to.
For it was as many as
phoned in to vote in the final.
I wish you could invent
how a phone could be a bomb-
triggered by America's Super Stellar
polling numbers.
The explosion could
label them in the face.
So I could know who I would
avoid talking to.
I would look at them and say:
No, you have nothing sensible to say.
Yes, but it's fun, it makes you recognize.
Steven Clark - it's fun.
It's not nice to laugh
to someone who is after.
It's the same freak show entertainment
that when an empire begins to collapse.
America's Super Stars
is as the Colosseum.
And I do not attend to the weak
made down to entertain us.
I've had enough.
Everything is so cruel.
I just want it to end.
Nobody talks about anything anymore.
They just repeat what they had seen television,
heard on the radio or seen on the net.
When you last spoke with someone without
they texted or saw any screen?
If something were not celebrities,
gossip, sports or popular policies.
Without something important.
Something personal.
You know what?
Tate and Jeff were just talking about it.
About how their freedom was in danger.
Do not you listen to them either?
-No, I do not.
Would you prefer Katie's snake pit?
They are wimps Frank, who had stolen
all they have from Tate and Jeff.
I do not like any of them.
How can you say that? So they may not
is "politically correct" but it is fun.
Well since I do not fear
foreigners or people with vaginas.
-So I'm probably not their target audience.
You do not get it so you get offended.
Well I do and get offended.
Not because I care about-
whiney, rich, disc jockeys who complain
on celebrities or how hard they have it.
While I live in an apartment
with the wafer-thin walls.
Next to the cave men with a baby
screaming as if it were air raid.
Kid alarm every night bloody
as if it was Pearl Harbor.
I take no offense, because they behave
as if it is my responsibility-
to protect their rights
to do down the weak, like pack mules.
Or that we should support their
freedom of speech when they do not care about ours.
So you are against freedom of speech now?
It is in the "Declaration of Rights."
I would defend their freedom of expression
if I thought it was threatened.
I would defend their freedom of expression
to express its racist rape joke-
in the guise of being "daring" but
it is not daring, but what sells.
They could not be more in the
commercial mainstream.
The sensations of this generation.
Weighing a shocking comment
heavier than the truth.
No one has any shame anymore,
and we will apparently celebrate it.
I saw a woman threw a used
tampon on another last night on TV.
On a channel that
calls itself a women's channel.
Kids films when they hit each other
and upload it on Youtube.
Remember when eating rats
and worms in Robinson was shocking?
Today it is almost commonplace.
I'm sure
girls from 2 Girls 1 Cup
get your own online dating program
at any time now.
I mean, why have a civilization
if we no longer want to be civilized?
Frank.
If you come into the office.
-Sure.
Come in, sit down.
You know from Ronald H. R.
-Yes.
Hey.
-Hello
Frank, there is no
easy way to say this.
So let's get straight to point.
What is your relationship
to Karen at the front desk?
Well, I just started
talk to her.
She is nice, we usually eat lunch
together. Is something wrong?
What is she charged with?
She would certainly never harm the firm.
That way.
Did you send flowers home to Karen?
Yes, I did.
Why?
She said she had a bad day
and I wanted to cheer her up.
How did you get her address?
-I looked it up.
I checked the records.
-Do you know that it is against our policy?
Yes but I did not send them
here and embarrass her.
Frank, I must tell you.
You're kidding, right?
-No, I'm not joking.
We have a zero tolerance policy
to harassment on the job.
And Karen does not feel
safe with you here.
She has never said anything to me.
I can talk to her.
Frank, listen here.
I want you to leave the quiet and clean.
Leave the Karen and other employees in peace.
The check with your final salary
come in the mail.
It's crazy, after 11 years.
-I know, but it's not me.
It comes from above.
Let me know if you need a reference.
Can you ask her about my book?
He wants back his book.
Thank you, Danny.
A tumor of this size
is very dangerous.
Unfortunately, a surgery to be
as dangerous as allowing it to be.
I advise you to discuss
it with your family.
Sorry, I must take this.
Yes.
What? I wanted it with the sunroof.
No, like the one we test drove.
I'll turn on you.
I'll come down to car sales
and put on your ass, you know?
I'll come down and turn your dick in you.
Or do you know what?
I twist your dick out of your giant gorilla
and stick it in the ass on you.
Yes, they arrange with a sunroof.
It would be great.
Thank you very much.
Do you have a family?
No, not directly.
Excuse me, you can not sit here.
On Tuesday,
Forget everything you know about bowling.
This is bowling on steroids.
Bowling. Impact. Rat.
You think you can go bowling?
Suck it.
Ok makes me happy, what do we have?
We have Steven Clark from
America's Super Stars.
He is a freak is not it?
Insanely fun.
I heard he lives with his mother.
-Wow, what a shock!
You're wasting our time, Steven.
What are you doing?
Stop bowing, just end it all.
-The guy is a freak.
Find out all you can about the crazy cuckoo.
Hi I'm Chloe, of Virginia Beach
and I am steering Holy Cross.
I love Chloe she is my
best best friend ever.
She is like my best friend.
She is so beautiful, so beautiful and so rich!
I love her and her
party will be so cruel!
I use only label as in Virginia
you can not find any dress.
So I told my father that
we must go to Paris.
-We could be twins.
Mom you look like a whore.
This is my thing, I hate you.
You ruin everything.
Wear it with health.
Happy Birthday.
-No boys in the back seat only.
Say something woman.
The camera rolls.
I wanted a Cadillac Escalade.
-You said ...
I wanted an Escalade!
Get out!
It is my job as a parent to
make her happy so I fucked up.
For she is not happy;
I have fucked me.
So tell us all about Chloe.
Chloe is not only my daughter;
she is my best friend.
Mom! They ask me.
I'm very popular, everyone loves
me because I'm so rich and beautiful.
This is my life's most important day
and you destroy everything.
Are you serious, you are so stupid
you do nothing and I get to do everything.
What the hell do you mean, Dad?
What the hell do you mean by that?
-We do this without them.
No, you can stay, I do not care.
-Hi.
I hate mum, I hate mom.
-What? What are you talking about?
I got a Blackberry and no iPhone.
Ok, I get to talk to your mom.
-Hey.
You gave her a Blackberry?
I do not want to hear it.
I thought that was what she wanted.
No, I meant why she gets a
Blackberry or Iphone?
-I do not need this now.
Did you talk to her about coming here?
Eva, Princess.
Want to go to your dad?
I want an Iphone.
I do not see my father more.
I want an Iphone!
I want an Iphone!
Frank, I must stop.
No, you can stay. I do not care.
I care only about my party.
Listen, it is the main
day of my life and you destroy it.
Seriously, you are so stupid
you do nothing.
I can do everything.
What the hell do you mean by that?
What the hell do you mean by that?
Dad listening, listening not
you're just talking with the camera.
I do not care about välkomstgåvor.
Hi FINK.
Is not this
skolflicke-thing a little old?
Mom, it's illegal to talk on the
phone while driving. I'll get there, goodbye.
Stay still and be quiet.
-Want to have your car, take it.
I still got the wrong model.
-Yeah, what a tragedy.
What are you doing?
Help!
Help! Help!
Chloe?
Did you just kill Chloe?
Sjyst.
Hello!
Strange glidar guy.
I know you're in there.
Hey.
What are you doing?
-None.
Good, same here.
I'm Roxy what's your name?
-Frank.
Nice to meet Frank.
Now tell me everything.
-About what?
She cried?
Yes.
It is wonderful!
I wish I had seen it up close.
Hi there.
It is nybäddat.
My God Frank. Go wild!
This is the best day.
Who will kill you next?
Can you ask for?
I could imagine
Kardashian few.
My PE teacher,
people doing high-fives
or the sports freak any time.
Twilight saga fans,
or those who talk about punk rock.
Who else gets a great wither?
-Go down from the bed.
Mormons and jerks
that does not allow gay marriage.
And adult women who call
their breasts for "girls" ...
Stop it!
Please, just say nothing.
Go down from the bed now, okay?
I must ask you to go.
I'm a little busy right now.
Cool.
Be careful with it.
-Wait.
No, do not do it privately.
Dear Eva, your life will be better off without me.
I'm sorry - greetings Dad.
A suicide note!
Are you kidding?
The best thing that happened around here
and you're just a sad jerk.
So do it then.
I want to watch.
See it!
How do you know that I did not kill you?
I do not, indeed,
so I do not care.
Frank.
What is it?
I had an idea.
Okay, go ahead.
Are you ready?
Yeah everything is ready.
Wait, again.
Sorry.
Can I say something first?
Go ahead.
It's just that you had
chance to do something good.
But you sumps it Frank.
Now you'll be just remembered as a foam
old stalker who was in love with a bimbo.
Just an old dirty old man
who killed the girl and then himself-
When he could not get her.
I did not kill her in order to
I could not get her.
I killed her
because she was rude.
And it was a great start
and you were right, she was a real bitch.
But with so many awful people
in the world that should be buried-
why stop?
If you kill yourself, Frank.
So you kill just the wrong person.
That just would be a shame when
There are so many Chloe's world-
that need to die.
Like who?
Racing fans, country fans,
People who dress up their young.
No, people who deserve to die.
All I said deserve to die.
Chloe's parents.
If someone is going to sound the horn.
And stay in your car no matter what.
It'll be the boss.
This is serious.
Frank.
-What?
This could be better than suicide?
I do not know.
Well I guess so.
Frank!
-Yes.
Get in the house and shut up.
Go on, go!
Go out there on the couch.
-Do as he says.
What do you want? We can give you money.
-Look. I'm very rich.
Do not you know who we are?
We are Chloe's parents, from the TV.
Well I know exactly who you are.
It was I who killed your daughter.
Damn it!
Yeah!
-Stop it.
-I told you to stay in the car.
Frank, she was about to escape.
Do you mean please?
-Here we go.
It was crazy right?
-Yes.
It feels ...
It feels ...
-Good?
Yes, it feels good.
It's weird.
Thank you.
Do you need extra napkins?
Sorry, I thought
indeed this could work.
Well, now it's my turn.
We will need some new clothes.
So where do we go from here?
What do you mean we?
There's nothing we.
Frank, I have to go with.
-I doubt it.
Come on, please.
-But your family then?
My family?
My mom is a pundar-whore.
I lived in a caravan with her-
and her boyfriend who used to
rape me every night.
I do not know what to say.
We can kill them.
-Yes!
No wait, we can not kill the
we feel, then we go down.
We have to do it randomly.
-It was a good idea.
You see, I already helping.
So please let me go with him.
But your friends do?
If you have no friends you can stay with?
Frank. I have no friends.
Okay then.
-Really? Thank you!
But you must do as I say.
No more "do as you like."
-Okay, thank you.
The washing machine is broken.
What are you doing?
Look, if we are in the news.
-Are we?
Yes, if the killings but nothing about us.
Reality star's family murdered.
-I see.
See you.
I've had this shirt.
Still ugly.
What do you think?
-It's probably a bit small.
Do you have a girlfriend?
-I will not answer.
Why not?
For you are a child.
It is not a suitable topic.
I simply asked
because I thought you were gay.
'I'm not gay.
You seem a little gay.
Really?
-Yes.
So if you have a girlfriend?
-No.
-A wife?
No longer does.
Attracted you of me?
-Do not be crazy.
You think I'm ugly?
I'm not attracted to you
for you are a child.
And you think I'm ugly?
I will not even respond to it.
But if we were the same age then?
-I do not answer it either.
So you can kill a teenager
but not to sleep with one?
Yes.
But you think I'm mature
for my age?
Not very.
So you're really not interested in me?
I am not a pedophile.
-So we are moral murderer?
So it is.
-Because you think I'm ugly?
It is unethical to answer that question,
I do not want to see the children so.
That is partly what is wrong with everything.
I'm not like those who try-
sell everything with the help of young girlhood.
-All men like young girls.
That's what society tries to tell you.
But perhaps we ought to aim a little higher-
than raping children.
To hell with R. Kelly.
To hell with Vladimir Nabokov.
And to hell with Mary Kay Letourneau
when we're at it.
To hell with Woody Allen and his
"The heart wants what it wants"-talk.
Apparently, to the poetic genius heart
have exactly the same as a pedophile wants.
A young, hairless Asian.
No one cares about
if they harm other people.
I was just wondering
if you thought I was beautiful.
I will not be held responsible
for any teenager's self esteem.
Do you like it, you can deduct.
-Fuck you Frank.
Frank!
-Hi.
I thought you were gone.
'I thought.
I have a gift.
I get it, Bonnie and Clyde.
-Do not wear it then.
I usually do not use caps
I do not fit so well in them.
But this one looks pretty good, thanks.
Your looking good.
Patty Hearst, is not it?
Hi, I'm at the movies.
I'm at the movies.
Look here, sweet huh?
Shyy,.
Okay mom.
Hey, we're sitting in the middle.
We sit in the middle!
Has this really happened?
Sit down!
Hey, no I can not, I work.
No, you can pick her up, I work.
What can I say?
As you check in old age?
Frank, do not.
-Take off your hat.
Let me do it.
Damn it, give it to me.
I play this out.
Thank you for not talking during the movie.
Thank you turned the phone.
Here you are.
Here you have that cushion.
-Thank you.
Good night, Frank.
One should not sleep here.
Let's see the license and registration.
Sure constable.
My dad has it all here.
I'm her uncle.
We are going down and visit some schools.
Cheer Big Blue!
Do you have any identification?
-Yes I have.
Okay I'm about.
No more sleeping on the roadside.
-Did you see my ID?
No, it's good, just take it gently.
The world is full of lunatics.
So true.
Thank you officer.
What did you say that for?
-I steal at least not cars.
Why do you think it is stolen?
Okay, I stole it.
But from a fool.
What is this?
-Do not get too attached to it.
Now it's your turn.
I'm a little bigger than you
so you get no Dirty Harry yet.
Keep your other hand like this,
for more stability.
Try it now.
Pretty good.
Concentrate on sight.
If you aim at the bear?
Do not think about recoil, just shoot.
Where did you get the teddy bear.
You can be proud of.
It was good.
-Thank you.
Time 3
At 6
At 12 o'clock
At 9
Does it feel good?
-Yes.
Migraine?
-Yes.
We can stop firing.
-Thank you.
-You did good.
I had a good coach.
And so I pretended that the targets
was cast in the soap Glee.
-What's wrong with Glee?
They make homosexuals into stereotypes.
And they destroyed the Rocky Horror.
-True.
Tea party movement continued torment
the parkinsonian patient after he slipped.
In depressing.
Why does not show to us?
It is one of the problems
in your generation.
You can not find pleasure in anything
if it is not recorded.
You were there, you lived it.
Is not that enough?
Next time you want to capture memories
so why not with the brain?
When I was your age
nobody tweetade-
Nevertheless, we managed to experience things.
The phone was attached to a wall home
in the house, and it had no camera.
Who do you think you are?
Claes Malmberg?
And at that time was sharing when
they helped each other to file out of the cell.
Some blame the movie for the murders.
Is it too violent?
Can you believe?
-Yes we are in the news!
No, what they say.
No one takes responsibility anymore.
What's the point?
I think they did it
because we all were so unpleasant.
There you are, incredibly,
truth and on this channel.
The suspect is a man around 60 years.
-Some 60 years?
The woman is in 20 to 25-years old.
They are considered armed and dangerous.
You see, they think I
is mature for my age.
-We are famous!
High five.
Do not leave me in the air, Roxy.
-No, I do not High Five.
A mental high five?
Drive to, a mental high five.
Steven Clark did not win America
Super Stars but a winner nonetheless.
Tweet what you think about
his new hit show.
Just drive to the guy who is
mentally retarded.
Cheer America.
Are you ready?
-It's your turn.
Just be sure to blow your brains out.
Ready?
Completely random.
Can occur at any time.
Are you ready, can I start?
Yeah, go ahead.
It was good.
You know what I hate?
-What?
I hate people who say
"In fact" all the time.
As you actually have a gun
to your head.
-It was good.
You are indeed still alive.
You know what I hate?
Those who err turns the word "literally".
Letter Believers, perhaps?
We are now close.
I hate those who buy the expensive cars
to then crawl on the road.
I hate guys with ladies pants.
-Trousers.
I'm no mathematician
but it's probably over.
Well Pythagoras might be time to die.
-How did it feel?
Good, good night to die.
Velocitea energizers,
that shows in your face.
Frank, I can sleep in the armchair.
-No, that's okay.
Slept in bed.
You're in the mood.
No, this is fine.
Behold the walls of Jericho.
It's good.
Frank put you in bed
Otherwise, I sleep on the floor.
I sleep on the floor.
Do you see? I lie.
Ugh, it smells!
Yes the floor is probably not a good idea.
Come on Frank.
What should we do now?
Well, what is our main directives?
I did not know you were a
Star Trek fan.
What does that mean?
I do not know, thought you were
more type Battlestar Galactica.
And graphic novels, and liked the music
Fall Out Boy and Green Day.
Fuck you Frank.
I happen to like Star Trek.
And I can also read
other than the picture.
And I prefer the classics, but is ashamed
not to have read Harry Potter.
Fall Out Boy and Green Day
is pure crap and suck apballe.
Musically, I am completely sold
Alice Cooper.
I like Alice Cooper.
You do not like Alice Cooper, Frank.
It is like a Muslim would say
he likes Muhammad.
It accepts Alice Cooper.
It is now accepted that Alice came down
and gave us the rock that upsets the authority.
And were all outcasts
not to feel so alone.
It is now accepted that. It would not
be a Goth Operating without Alice
no Reznor Trent,
no Marilyn Manson.
Even cash-soft-rockers who
Poison or Bon Jovi. For not only-
he brought into the theater in horror rock
but he also invented the power ballad.
With the song: Only Women Bleed.
Okay I get it.
I will not kill Alice Cooper.
Not even kidding about that, Frank.
Do you realize that he was the first
rock star who wear makeup?
And he wore a long dress
before Bowie stole the idea.
And he was yelling about death and frustration
long before punk.
So just for you to accept
that Alice Cooper invented that too.
Have you possibly ADHD Juno?
Yes I have ADHD and call me
for the hell never Juno again.
Sorry.
Now I know who to kill next.
-A fictional character?
No, Diablo Cody, who wrote the film.
She is the only stripper that
have too much self-esteem.
I do not want to kill someone
just because you do not like their movies.
Why not? She encourages
teenagers to have children.
The plot and the characters suck,
and she does everything seem fun-
so that the girls that I presented as
sweet pricks from any Vulgar children's book.
"Courtney here with pierced belly button,
chewing gum and farted. "
I just want to kill them
who really deserve to die.
Do you know who we should kill?
Those who use
"Rock star" as an adjective.
As in "a rock-star-park".
Or people who drink
energy drink all day.
Or those who use the expressions:
Awesome, "a taste of the cake," or huge dish.
No wait, then there would be
some Taco vendors left.
All bearing crystals
or call themselves spiritual.
Or people who say Namaste.
-What does that mean?
An Indian greeting that Hippies speech.
Hippies!
Or someone who
buy an anarchy-shirt.
Or those who use the term
"The Man" - positive or negative.
As in "The Man" run over us.
Or you're a "man".
Those who have been inflated.
-Or tagged.
All that physically makes High fives.
-Agreed.
So you claim freedom of speech here
in my program, so let me explain:
I would rather lose the freedom of expression
than to have you as an advocate for it.
Look up your ärthjärna. Movements that you
is a greater threat than terrorists.
All that feeds on
to spread fear to the people.
Or that is simply evil.
So our our main directive is to mix
us in cultural evolution.
Now I have to sleep,
headache is driving me crazy.
Stop it.
It helps with headaches
there are acupressure, no sensual.
And those who use the word sensual.
-Illegal.
It was you who said it.
You Frank.
Thanks for letting me join you.
-Good night Juno.
Fuck you Frank.
Shall we do it, right?
Well, what do you think?
It's good.
My God Frank you look absolutely pie out.
There he is.
Women.
I have to start training again.
-Did we get him?
He was probably just wing clipped.
He breathes?
I do not know.
Do not move or I'll shoot her.
-You would never dare.
-Really? Should I not?
Go fuck your condescending asshole.
Why must you always be so unpleasant?
Is that what this is about?
My TV shows.
You must really hate my opinions.
Listen, you are killing me;
so do you make me just a martyr.
I do not hate your opinions,
I agree in some things.
Do you?
-Yes.
What's this all about then?
Why are you always so mean?
Are you willing to die because I'm evil?
-Do you have what it takes then, Fuller?
When did you shoot last one?
No wait, you're never done.
Because you were never in the military.
Your parents ordered some so you limp.
Like every other rich braggart
that feed on xenophobia.
Those of you who use tragedies
to promote self-s-agenda
to protect the big oil companies the right
to boil the earth alive.
Just because someone bonnig President
began to receive orders from Jesus
or the Easter Bunny,
or any other imaginary.
Please! Add to your uneducated
feminist-nazi left snack.
Feminist-Nazi.
Why must you be so mean.
He just wish that everyone was friendly.
While I think your opinion sucks.
You bitch.
Yes.
Exactly which of his opinions like you?
-Less gun control.
But Frank. Then, each fool
Running around with a gun.
Wow.
Look at all these people.
Yes, I wish I had an AK-47: a
Fuller's supporters call him a hero
and link the murder to terrorists.
Fuller was right.
He has become a fucking martyr.
Fucking idiots.
I do not care.
I'm just glad he's dead.
Is your ex-wife?
-Yes.
She is beautiful.
Yes.
I do not care if we're late,
I hate school.
I thought it was you Frank.
Hey Brad.
New trailer?
-Yes.
You want to come and say hello?
No, they look busy out.
Who's your friend?
A friend of mine.
Let me know if you are near,
the girls will surely meet you.
Thank you.
Do not tell me that we were here.
-No, I get it.
Can you download Eva's backpack in the house?
-Sure!
Shall we kill him?
I hate that I want the other.
No, I want him to suffer.
Is not it too early for beer?
I do not think they have cognac.
Have you been to a doctor?
Yes, I'm fine.
Give me your hand.
-It will not work.
Is there anything nyandligt shit?
-It does work.
Quiet and give me your other hand.
Do you know what you need?
-A straw?
You need a vacation.
You are all communists!
Here, take all my money;
what is this? Russia?
Do you have to park more than two locations?
Yeah, fuck off.
Go to hell.
Come back inside.
It is beautiful.
-It is divine.
Come on Frank, we dance.
-I do not dance.
Come on, you just have to follow me.
-I doubt it.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
The pleasure is mine.
Next, I will sing
a rap song: Fuck the police.
No I was kidding.
Thank you very much.
I've been thinking.
Can we not become legal?
What do you mean?
Enter ourselves to the police?
No. We can move to France or
any other country that hates Americans.
Will those of us
we do not have to be extradited.
And we can have a French country house
with cute little goats and make goat cheese.
It sounds nice.
Give me your hand.
I still can not believe
that it works.
Do you know where you are headed?
We do know where Steven Clark should.
He has been asked
to appear in the final-
after last week
unsuccessful suicide attempt.
We should kill them all.
They ridicule him until
he almost kills himself.
Then utilizing the Him-
so everyone can feel a little better
to have laughed at him.
I hate this country.
That's why we're moving
to France.
Hey.
Hello Doctor, it's Frank Murdock
you had left a message.
Yes I did.
I have some bad news.
You do not have a brain tumor.
-What?
You should not die.
I do not understand.
I saw the pictures.
Yes there was a tumor but it was
Frank Burdocks images, with B. Burdock
Not Frank Murdock with M.
What was the bad news then?
The kuksugaren Burdock
will probably sue me.
But my constant headache?
Hell if I know. Maybe you sit for
close to the computer, or have high blood pressure-
Perhaps you are exercising too little, eat too
much viagra or what do I know?
By the way, you're not going to sue me?
No, I would never do.
-It was good to hear.
Thanks for the good news.
Now I have to call kuksugaren Burdock
with the bad news.
We sell car
and move to France.
-Really?
There will be très magnifique.
I can very French. I can be different
wines and ask where the library is located.
-I can ask for a cigarette.
I can oh là là, but that's all.
I can oui.
What more do we need?
Speaking of need,
I need to go to the bathroom.
Wittily.
Dude, what's with the girl?
-Excuse me?
I look at you
she's not your daughter.
She is my niece.
-I have many nieces.
How much for a day?
You're probably mistaken.
Yeah stick with that story.
I'll buy it.
-Have a nice day.
Just like I know you will have.
Do not use all the hot water!
-I will not.
Best to you relax a little
in France.
You do not shower in France.
We want to thank everyone who
help us in the search for Roxy.
We pray that she is still alive.
-Roxy we miss and love you.
If anyone has information about ...
Satan's shit!
Frank? Is that you?
What has happened?
Your parents!
-What?
I saw them just on the TV
You lied to me.
Would I have come if I
said that I lived in an ordinary house?
With normal parents? Which is not abused
on me, but just did not want to understand me.
The fact that every day felt like a million years.
And that I was constantly
told what to do.
And what I would think, of those I
is a million times smarter than.
So I always had to
pretend to listen.
And every morning I woke up and
just wanted something to happen.
Here are the keys to the car.
-But where should I go?
I do not care, go to your parents.
I have no time for you,
You are just like everyone else.
I have no time for liars!
-Fuck you Frank.
You're just a pathetic, broken man.
Your cocksucker!
We could not be happier.
After all we went through.
Now we are reunited as a family.
-We are planning a family vacation.
We are going to Disneyland!
Are you Frank?
Frank you did not say quite what you were
after so I brought a little of everything.
We have a 357 magnum.
Nickel finish, 6 shot, and 8 inch pipe.
A 357, so you know it has power.
If you put this at anyone's head.
So is a pink mist all that remains.
But it is perhaps not for you.
Retro.
A Walther P38, a German 9-millimeter,
made during World War 2.
I mean, who is
better at killing than the Germans?
So it has to perform well.
You're not Jewish?
I only ask for
I was a German gun.
Or maybe ...
Maybe looking for something bigger?
A little more power.
Then we'll see what we have here.
What a beauty, no?
AK-47 when you only have to kill every
bastard in the room. Only the best is good enough.
Yes this like you, it shows.
7.62 x 39th A rifle
but still lightweight.
And trust, I would
able to throw down from the roof.
I could
run over it with the car.
I could bury it in the ground.
Dig it up, and it still works.
How reliable is it.
The best mass-produced
weapon ever made.
Check out, it's perfect for you.
You're like Rambo! Perfect.
You do not even aim.
Just let the rain of bullets falling.
What could be better than that?
The only thing is, it is not cheap.
It is a rifle
so we end up around 2000 for it.
So I do not know if it is within your
budget. But you get 3 full magazine.
So it's a real bargain.
For a real quality weapons.
Is there anything you can afford?
Yes, I want to have your bag with.
-Great.
Is there anything more you want?
Cocaine? Amphetamine?
The live broadcast:
American Superstars - Final.
Ladies and gentlemen.
While we all waited for.
Welcome to the stage:
Steven Clark!
Yes please, go around.
Look at me. I have killed
many and I can kill you with.
The question is, would you die for
this worthless TV show?
It's just a job for me.
I can not even see on the program.
It was the right answer.
I give you to 5.
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ...
In other news. Lindsay Lohan
maintains that she still is-
sober and happy.
Have we heard this before?
But she looks good in their jewelry.
And speaking of Hollywood's wildlife.
Is it Bigfoot at the pool?
Oh no it's Robin Williams.
Hey, where you may not be.
Are you deaf?
Buuu!
-Go down from the stage!
You suck!
You suck! Buuu!
Nobody move! Sit down!
I did not concern you!
Next time someone moves,
I site as blowing!
Can I go?
-No, stay here Steven.
Get up!
I said, get up!
-You're kidding right?
The two of you, share with you.
-No, please.
You do not want to do this.
-How do you know what I want to do?
Just take it easy.
Come up here, both of them.
Stay there!
Otherwise, she gets a bullet in the skull.
You think Steven is funny huh?
I saw that you were laughing so I
ask again. Do you think he is funny?
Yes.
Then you can dance.
Start the music.
Come on, dance!
I said, dance! Come on!
And sing.
Sing which:
You too, you used to sing.
And the rest of you, booing and laughing
as you did before.
Higher than that!
-Frank!
9 o'clock.
What the hell was that?
Do you do something stupid again
I'll get the roof to cave in..
What are you doing here?
-Sorry I lied to you.
What do you want?
That you put down your weapons.
-We can not do.
Then I will continue
shoot judge until you can.
It was not a police officer who sneaked up on you.
There was a guard, so calm down.
Can you say who you are?
Who I am? Certainly.
Is the camera on?
My name is Frank.
But that's not important.
The important question is:
Who are you?
America has become a cruel
and corrupted place.
We reward the most superficial, the stupidest,
the meanest and the most vocal.
We no longer have any decency.
No shame, and no right or wrong.
Those with the worst properties.
Are the ones that people look up to and celebrate.
Lies and fear-mongering is okay.
As long as you earn money from it.
We have become a country with a slogan
who say, vomit bile - inciting hatred.
We have lost our kindness.
We have lost our soul.
What have we become? When mock
the weakest in society?
Laugh at them,
for our entertainment's sake.
We laugh at them until they'd rather commit
suicide than continue to live with us.
Frank.
Yeah Steven.
It was not therefore
I tried to commit suicide.
But it was because I did not
would be involved in the TV anymore.
You are a beautiful girl.
Thank you Frank.
