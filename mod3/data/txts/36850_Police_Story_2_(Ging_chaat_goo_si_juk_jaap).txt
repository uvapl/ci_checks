We managed to put Chu Tu behind bars
but the operation was a costly one.
You destroyed the squatter village
and the Government had
to rehouse the families.
You destroyed
the whole shopping centre as well.
We paid over a million
for the chandelier alone.
But the taxpayers know
police work doesn't come cheaply.
But they don't expect to pay for
the cost of someone's heroism.
Why didn't you use the stairs? Did
you have to destroy that chandelier?
Do you always have to be different?
You're right.
This force doesn't need superstars.
We need disciplined policemen.
I wasn't expecting a promotion.
Ka-kui, the operation
succeeded through team effort,
not just because of you.
You should be grateful
that we didn't fire you.
And the bosses wanted you disciplined
for holding me hostage.
- I managed to talk them out of it.
- I'm very grateful.
I worry about your individualism,
you're just a police officer.
As of today, you're back in uniform.
- You'll be assigned where needed.
- You mean he'll be an errand boy?!
I think you'll be very busy.
So unlucky!
What else do you do
apart from give out tickets?
Calling all units,
there's been a serious road accident
at the Industrial Park.
All units in the area please respond.
May, go home. I'm working now.
Just think of me
as a member of the public.
- And I want to talk to a policeman.
- About what?
I think you look
very smart in a uniform.
- Stop it, I'm on duty.
- I've brought you a cold drink.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- I can't drink here.
- Go on, you need a break.
If I have a drink,
I'll need the toilet soon.
- Come on.
- May, I'll get into trouble.
Hello, superhero!
You still haven't been sacked?!
You're lucky
you're not in jail with Chu.
You think so?
The doctors said
I only had three months to live.
It's called compassionate release.
Three months can pass quickly -
very quickly.
My client will be alive
long after you're dead.
Don't you know
you're threatening him?
Really?
In that case, he can sue me.
Drive on.
Ka-kui?
That policeman
caused me untold problems.
As long as I'm still alive,
I'll make his life hell.
Boss, if you asked me to help people,
I wouldn't know what to do.
But I know lots of good ways
to teach him a lesson.
- I'm very happy tonight.
- The show and dinner were great.
- But you don't seem very happy.
- Really? I am happy.
I wish you had enjoyed it
as much as I did.
- Are you worried about Chu?
- No. But I'm just being careful.
- Maybe next week...
- Hey, superhero!
- Off duty already?
- What are you doing here?
I can park here,
you can't give me a ticket.
Yeah, you must have a nice view
from the first floor. Am I right?
Go upstairs.
How did you find this address?
It's amazing what information
you can get with money.
People will do anything for money,
you know?
What do you mean?
There's a narrow stairwell
in the building.
If there was a fire, it'd spread
rapidly through the building.
Because of the narrow access, the
fire brigade couldn't get in here.
Therefore, you'd better
keep a close eye on her.
If she were to get
her pretty ass burnt,
- It'd ruin her marriage prospects.
- Bastard!
May.
Auntie.
- You're on your own. Where's Ka-kui?
- He's still on duty.
It's OK, I can manage.
I'm not against you dating
a policeman,
but I don't want him
to spend too much time on his work.
- He's stubborn, too.
- But he's a good policeman.
That's why he has lots of enemies
and you have to move home.
I have to be careful. That way
he doesn't need to worry about me.
He ought to worry about you.
- Who are they?
- It was them last time.
I guess superhero isn't here.
- Wait for me in the restaurant.
- Right.
- What do you want?
- We have a score to settle.
I just want to know
where you're going.
- It's nothing to do with her.
- You must be her mother.
Am I right?
- Bastard!
- You call me a bastard?
Yes! I'm the bastard son
of a bastard!
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Come on.
Auntie, why has your daughter
fallen for a cop?
That could be dangerous. Living on
the 19th floor is dangerous, too.
What if you fall
when you're cleaning the windows?
Go ahead!
Don't be silly.
Go away.
Get her hand off me.
Don't grab my hair.
- You bastard.
- Let go!
You're hurting me.
You bitch.
- Easy, she's just a girl.
- Think yourself lucky.
If you were a man, you'd be dead.
- Come on.
- I won't forget this.
Are you hurt?
Look, May was badly beaten
because of you!
I've told you not to go out with him.
- Did John Ko attack you?
- I started hitting him first.
- He just hit me back.
- And they knocked me down.
My backside still hurts.
I can't sit down now.
- How did they know you'd be here?
- They followed her.
That's how.
They're watching us
from across the street.
I wonder what's next.
Ka-kui, be careful.
Idiot! Are you crazy?
- Why did you hit my girlfriend?
- It's my favourite hobby.
I'm sorry!
Get the bastard!
You know the law, don't you?!
If they did threaten her,
you could arrest them.
I got carried away, sir.
- That's not good enough.
- He reacted like anyone else would.
He's not anyone else.
He's a police officer.
What you've done is disgraceful!
If a policeman fails to respond to
a personal threat,
it's disgraceful, too.
You're a show-off.
So we won't forget you arrested Chu.
How can I explain this
to the chief!
You don't have to. I quit.
You think that
will resolve the problem?
Why not?
This is probably the best solution.
I'll leave now.
Thank you for your support
in the past.
Goodbye.
Ka-kui.
If that's your last word, then try
to find a less stressful job.
Bye-bye.
I will.
You think you can do anything
because you're cops.
Don't you know the law?!
You can't beat me up just like that.
- Shut up and sign this.
- I'm not signing anything. No way!
I'll sue you for every penny
you've got.
I've got lots of money.
I'll get a lawyer. I'll sue you!
- What?!
- No!
See? You saw this officer
try to assault me.
He wants to beat me up like before
when he hit me and broke my glasses.
You'll pay for that.
You would dare to beat me up here?
Come on. What are you waiting for?!
Come on. I'm going to sue you,
you're going to jail.
These youngsters have no patience.
Bill, why didn't you ask him to stay?
You should have said so! I thought
you meant throw him out of here.
Now I know what this gesture means,
I'll remember it.
Ka-kui, what's the matter?
You don't want me
to be a policeman, do you?
Of course I do, I'm proud of you.
What do I have after being a cop
for such a long time? Just enemies.
There you go!
That means you've done your job well.
If a cop has no enemies,
he hasn't caught any crooks.
I'm glad they hate you!
It proves that you're a good guy.
Thanks for that.
But I've had enough.
I resigned today.
- Really?
- Aren't you happy?
You're really quitting?!
I'm so happy!
- Calm down.
- What's she doing?!
- That's $5,540, please.
- Right.
I'll see you outside.
- Credit card?
- Sure.
Here's our catalogue, sir.
Thank you. Bye.
- What clothes should I take?
- You won't need any in Bali.
Don't be silly!
I can't believe we're going.
- I just hope they won't rip us off.
- No, they're a big company.
It's paid for now.
Let's cross our fingers.
- Fey!
- Ka-kui.
Is this your area?
- What's up?
- We've received a bomb threat.
- Really?
- Yeah. Can you help us out?
- All right, then.
- Thanks.
- Ka-kui!
- I'll just take a look, all right?
- Sun.
- Just in time.
- What's up?
- We got a call about a bomb.
- Are you sure it's real?
- I don't think he was kidding.
He told us to clear the area.
- We have ten minutes.
- Really?
Start clearing the building now.
- There are too many people.
- If it's a hoax, who'll be to blame?
I'm used to getting an earful.
If it is real, we'll endanger lives.
- That's true.
- What do we do?
Consider it real. Clear the building.
Call headquarters.
- Where's the fire alarm?
- Over there.
Ka-kui.
We'll go set off the fire alarm.
Come on.
- Your truncheon.
- But...
Come on, I need it.
Follow me.
What's that?
What's going on?
Don't panic. Don't worry. Come back.
- I've opened the till already.
- Have they paid?
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.
What should we do?
They're not taking any notice.
Ka-kui.
Don't stay here. Go on!
Your attention please,
evacuate the building.
Everybody please leave immediately.
There's a fire in the building.
Please leave now.
- Please leave in an orderly manner.
- Everybody outside.
Be careful.
Fay.
- What's up?
- Get them out of here.
This is for your own safety.
- Go now!
- What about you?
I won't be long. You go first.
Check the building.
I can't understand this. It's crazy!
Who's in charge?
You talk to them.
Please leave here now,
the police will take care of it.
- Ka-kui. Ka-kui!
- I'm all right. You go home first.
- Hello, sir.
- Who made the call?
We received a call
but we didn't know if it was a hoax.
Who set off the alarm?
It was me, sir.
You may leave.
Why did you do it?
Sir, when I was
in the Police Academy,
I was taught that public safety
comes first. So I set off the alarm.
Do you think
you're indispensable?
Superintendent.
There's no fire. But it was your men
who cleared the building.
Right.
The Bomb Disposal Unit are coming.
- You won't be needed now.
- Right. I hope this isn't a hoax.
- Uncle Bill.
- So do I.
Raymond. They want to see
the head man. Shall I go?
- Where's the Bomb Disposal Unit?
- On their way.
- What a mess.
- Did I do the right thing?
How do I do know? Don't ask me.
Right now, we have to wait and see.
Tell them to leave.
You can go back in very soon.
My ball!
- When can we go back in?
- Very soon.
- Here's your ball.
- Thank you.
- Ready?
- The Bomb Disposal Unit are here.
If they don't find anything,
the boss will blow a fuse.
- Uncle Bill, I'm very sorry.
- I'm not...
Red alert! All units move in.
Go and fight the fire. Go on.
I suppose the good news is
nobody got hurt. What are the losses?
The insurance will cover it.
I'm more worried about
the damage to our image.
I've asked the press to cooperate
and I'm sure they will.
But who did it and why our company?
It may not be against us.
It could be someone
who's mentally disturbed.
There's a man on the line, sir.
- He says he planted the bomb.
- Have it put through.
- Put him through.
- Hello? Hold on.
Listen, we planted the bomb
in your shopping centre.
We want $10 million. Pay up or your
other properties will get bombed.
Let me talk to him.
All right.
But it's a huge amount of money.
We'll need to call a board meeting.
You've got 24 hours.
Don't call the police.
Raymond, you were extremely lucky.
It's amazing that no one
was hurt in the explosion.
Thank God for that.
And the Chu case, well done!
- Thank you. But it wasn’t just me.
- That's right.
You've proved yourself.
You should handle this case.
Do you agree?
- Sure.
- Of course.
- Bill.
- Morning, sir.
- This is a very tough case.
- That's why they gave it to us.
In our department,
who do you think can solve it?
- You're the only one.
- I want a better idea.
And it's definitely not me.
Maybe we could bring back
somebody who's on leave.
Do you mean somebody like Ka-kui?
- He has good experience.
- I don't know.
He's unorthodox, impulsive.
He'll only give us trouble.
I agree he's a little bit rash,
but underneath he's a good cop.
I won't let him do it. But If you
think he's our man, you go find him.
Let's see who's the boss.
- Over there.
- Here?
Did you get your passport
when you were young?
Put out a call
for Detective Chan Ka-kui.
Sure.
Attention please.
- Will Chan Ka-kui...
- Let me see.
- No, don't look!
- It's cute.
- It's horrible.
...Ka-kui please contact us.
- That's you.
- Yeah.
- What's up?
- I don't know. I won't be long.
- Are you Mr. Chan?
- Yeah.
I'm afraid there seems to be
a problem with your passport.
- Really?
- It'll just be a quick check.
What's going on?
- I'll be back right away.
- Hurry!
What do you want?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- What is it? I have a plane waiting.
- We have a problem.
It seems that the bombing case
has become a blackmail case.
- And it's a very tough one.
- So?
- This case is a real challenge.
- Raymond was hoping...
I was hoping that
you might cancel your holiday.
No! I've already boarded the plane.
- And I've quit.
- I know how you feel.
You've been under pressure lately.
But ducking out like this?
- I'm not ducking out.
- He said he's not ducking out!
Raymond is a great admirer
of your abilities.
I don't have any abilities.
I'm too impulsive.
- Impulsive? More a man of action.
- If only I could control my actions.
A true man of action
is one who acts upon instinct.
I think the police force
needs men with discipline.
Instinctive men
have to be unconventional,
even at the cost of discipline.
If you did everything by the book,
no cases would be solved.
- Am I right?
- Absolutely.
I'd better get back on board.
- You're right.
- Goodbye.
- How much is the ransom?
- Ten million. That's all we know.
- Do we have any suspects?
- Not a clue.
Do you think these people are insane?
Why are you asking me? I don't know.
Have you traced the dynamite?
- Why?
- Yes. Why?
Simple. Dynamite
is a controlled substance
so you either smuggle it in
or steal it from a local company.
He's right. We'd not thought of that.
We must find their bomb factory
before the company pays the ransom.
If we do that,
we can foil their plans.
Why can you always solve problems
so easily?
You're the one
who's made for this case.
You're in charge.
- I've got a plane to catch.
- Wait! Ka-kui.
You can go there any time.
This case is a one-off.
Go there next time. OK?
- I'd better talk to May first.
- Hurry up, then.
Hurry up.
- Miss!
- Yes, sir?
- My plane...
- It just took off.
It's taken off!
- You've missed your flight!
- Trust them to be on schedule.
I still have May's passport.
Damn! It sure isn't your lucky day!
Uncle Bill, we better go.
- All right?
- I ate something bad.
- That way, sir.
- Thank you.
Excuse me. We're police officers.
We're here to see Miss Wong.
- 30th floor.
- Thank you.
Bugging devices.
Be careful, Nixon lost his job
because of one of these.
If we are to solve the case,
we have to know our targets well.
We're counting on you.
Put them away.
Miss Wong, there are two police
officers here.
- Where's the loo?
- On your right.
Thanks.
25 please.
24 please.
Wait!
Uncle Bill,
I'm really worried about May.
I'll call Jakarta airport
as soon as I get to the office.
Uncle Bill.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Haven't you got any manners?
Let's use the other elevators.
Detective Sergeant Chan
to see Miss Wong.
- If you'll please wait.
- Thank you.
I thought you were
used to taking the blame.
- That's no excuse!
- I...
Gentlemen.
I'm Detective Chang,
this is Detective Chan.
- Please come with me.
- We're...
I know. Mr. Fung is busy now
but he's signed the papers.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me, where's the toilet?
- Down the corridor.
- Here, sir.
- I'm so sorry.
It's OK.
- Where's your friend?
- He had a sudden urge.
There's the chairman.
That site is worth three billion.
- Hello, sir.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Thanks for all your help.
You're developing the new estates
very fast.
Please sit.
Welcome to all directors,
managers and heads.
I've called this meeting
to review the performance
of our property portfolio
and to set the sales target
for the next year.
You may all know that
since the collapse of
the stock market last year,
the Hang Seng Index has risen 66%.
Let me show you the performance
of the major blue chip shares.
As you can see, both the hotel and
manufacturing sectors are doing well,
which has a positive effect
on the Hong Kong economy.
However, by the performance
of the bank and property sectors,
the outlook of the stock market for
the next half year remains uncertain.
In situations like this,
small investors are likely
to put their money in property.
So we have to accelerate the pace of
developing our new housing estates.
Hi, you're gorgeous.
If someone asks the chairman
for this, it's $500 to get it back.
- Really?
- Yeah. Bye-bye.
- What happened?
- It's a meeting.
- Did you plant the bugs?
- Sure.
- And the desk?
- All done.
- Was it easy?
- He wasn't against it!
What was said?
- Something about houses.
- Really?
- Where are you going?
- I'll take the next one.
May's here.
May, you're back!
May.
- You scumbag!
- Let me explain.
- You...
- You didn't want me to come back!
You left me there
and took my passport!
When I got there,
I couldn't do anything.
Before I was sent back here, they
detained me for ten hours in a cell!
Why should I keep my voice down?
When you take your dog for a walk,
do you not take him home afterwards?
- I'm even worse than a dog.
- May, they're watching us.
What are you staring at?
It's none of your business!
I want you to tell me in front
of everyone what you think I am.
- What the hell do you take me for?
- You're my girlfriend!
Your girlfriend?! Open up! Open up!
If that's true,
why treat me that way?
You even treat strangers
better than me.
Let me tell you...
it's over between us!
Chan Ka-kui, you bastard!
- Uncle Bill, did you make that call?
- I needed to go to the toilet.
You've ruined my life.
- Wait!
- Go away or I'll run you over.
- Go away!
- Don't be childish!
Don't grab my bag! Go away!
Don't even touch me. Go away.
- Leave me alone.
- Let me explain.
I don't want to know.
- I've nothing else to say to you.
- May!
May, are you all right?
Stay away from me.
Don't touch my motorbike. Keep away.
- I don't want you anywhere near me.
- Let me explain.
Why won't you help me?!
- May.
- Just keep away from me.
- I don't want to see you again.
- May.
All right, get back to work.
I want to see Ka-kui.
Ka-kui, the boss wants to see you.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's all right.
Do you want to call May to explain?
- I don't think it would help.
- Don't explain to women!
If a man's not at home,
it's obvious he's working.
Excuse me,
I have to go to the toilet.
Don't take any notice
of his chauvinism. Go get changed.
May.
Are you going home, May?
It's better than wasting
my time here. Good night.
- Can I walk you home?
- No thanks.
- Don't be foolish.
- No, I won't.
Get me, it's me you want.
- Don't be foolish.
- You're in this together.
- Don't try anything.
- Prepare to die!
I really had you going!
I got the both of you!
Ka-kui!
I've found it.
Looks like you're outnumbered.
I know it's over the top bringing
all these men but you never know.
I'm flattered.
And so you ought to be.
My boss asked me
to teach you a lesson.
But I don't need to dirty my hands,
my men can take care of you.
- Get on with it.
- We'll give you a chance.
If you apologize to Mr. Ko now,
we won't break both of your legs.
We'll just break one of them.
- Cut the bullshit. Go on, kill me.
- Kill a cop? No, I don't think so.
My boss wants to teach you a lesson.
Ripping a few limbs off
should do the trick.
Get him!
There he is. Beat him up!
Go on, finish him off.
Get up. Move over. Let me drive.
I'll turn you into mashed banana.
It wasn't my fault!
I was paid to do it.
Keep away or I'll shoot!
- Shoot me! Shoot here!
- I'll shoot.
It's not my fault.
- It's not. It's not my fault.
- Next time I'll kick your ass.
It's not my fault.
May.
May.
Did they hurt you?
I'm all right.
You'd better be careful.
Why did you chase him?
- It's dangerous.
- I wanted to make things up to you.
If it had been acid in that pistol
and not ink, I'd have been scarred.
Maybe they wanted to distract you
and then kidnap me.
Then what would happen?
Ka-kui.
I want my boyfriend to be gentle,
not a savage. Do you understand?
Come in.
"Police detective in park rumpus."
Who was that? Look!
I'll check out the surveillance team.
"Police Detective in Park Rumpus"
It was me.
I know Chu wants revenge, but don't
take the law into your own hands.
Sorry, sir.
- Anything I can do?
- No, thanks.
I can cope with it.
I just want them to leave me alone.
All right. But keep your eyes open.
Now we've got a surveillance team.
They're very good.
Go and talk to them.
Did he give you an earful? Did he...
Let's go over there.
Anything yet?
Fung said his shares
would go up.
- That's hardly relevant.
- And his girlfriend is a top model!
I'm not interested.
I'll take it. You go call May.
Go on.
Ka-kui! Listen.
Your conditions have been presented
to the board and they will pay.
No shit. Do you have the money?
We don't have it all.
$10 million is a lot of money.
Trace it.
- It's from Tai Po.
- Check it out.
He's in Ting Kok Road.
HQ calling all foot patrols.
Are there any units in Ting Kok Road,
over?
This is PC 1267 on Ting Kok Road,
over.
PC 1267, check anybody leaving
a phone box in the area.
- Are you stalling for time?
- No. We didn't call the police.
- Now we want 20 million.
- 20 million!
- It's impossible.
- Find it.
Wait!
- This is PC 1267.
- Anything?
- I think I've got a suspect.
- Be careful. He's very dangerous.
He could be armed.
Keep everything low key.
Excuse me, you're supposed to use
the pedestrian crossing.
- Go on.
- Give me a chance, Officer.
Can I see your ID card?
Calling HQ...
An officer needs assistance
in Ting Kok Road.
- I'm sorry, he isn't here.
- Don't be sorry.
It's the way things go.
It wasn't your fault.
- How long have you been in uniform?
- About two months.
Then you're excused.
Will I get in trouble
for losing my gun?
- What about promotions?!
- Don't worry.
As long as you learn
from the experience, it's OK.
- It happens to every cop.
- It won't happen again.
- Do you think you'd recognise him?
- Sure.
Phone.
I could do with someone like you
on the team. I'll see to it.
Thank you. Can you file this for me?
- Hello.
- It's Joker.
- Go ahead.
- News.
What news?
A guy called Crazy Fai sells
dynamite. Nine o'clock, Hoi Wong Bar.
- Do you know what we'll do next?
- No.
Really?
- What do you want?
- Are you Fai? I want to talk.
- Do I know you?
- No. But you will.
All right. Let's go over there.
I'll be right back.
- What's your name?
- Lo.
- What do you want?
- Some explosives.
- Explosives?
- Do you have some?
- What are they for?
- Fishing.
You don't look like a fisherman.
What if I told you
it was for business?
I'll give you a good price,
what do you say?
All right,
I need to speak to someone.
It's not my stuff. Don't go away.
Thanks.
Sorry, he's out of stock
but he'll call me back.
Stay here,
I'll be back when I've finished.
Thank you.
Hey, you. Stand up.
- What's the matter?
- CID. On your feet.
- Hands up.
- I only came for a drink.
We heard you were dealing contraband.
Eyes front.
Hold it.
Throw me your gun. Quick!
- Stand over there.
- Easy. Don't do anything stupid.
- Move! Where are they?
- I don't know.
Come on. Move.
Get lost.
You screwed me over. You bastard!
Why did you call the cops?
Stop! Stop it!
Please, that's enough. Please stop.
- Why did you do it?
- To make sure you weren't a cop.
- I can get what you need.
- Where is it?
Have you got the money?
It's cash on delivery.
Keep a look out.
- Is it good stuff?
- It's from the quarries.
- Got any more?
- Yeah, plenty.
There's enough to blow up
the Empire State Building.
I just met him!
I've never seen him before!
Do you think you can get away?
- Would you like a coffee?
- A cigarette?
If you cooperate,
you'll walk out of here.
- Have you had good results this way?
- Sure. It never fails.
What's the charge?
I'm going to jail anyway.
I've seen a lot worse than this
before but I'll play along.
You all seem like
nice young ladies...
Have you not seen anything
like this before?
No! Stop! I've had enough.
No, please!
Nice young ladies, huh?
- Aren't you going to play along?
- I'll sue you!
Say that again. Guns have a habit of
going off when you least expect it.
- We'll just say it was an accident.
- Yeah. Escaped prisoner!
No! I'll talk.
- Why didn't you say so?
- Come on, sit down.
- Cigarette?
- No.
There are men in here.
Show's over.
I sold some explosives lately.
One buyer was a fisherman.
He uses it to blast reef fish.
The other one buys my stuff
to refill empty bullet shell cases
and then he sells them as bullets.
The third guy's name was Polar Bear.
He's a big-time dealer.
He often hangs out
at the Yaumatei Pool Hall.
I'll take a look.
Polar Bear.
You went shopping?
- Were you followed?
- No. Don't worry.
Come on. Open up.
Ka-kui, I followed them to
a storage depot where they met a guy.
There are three of them.
We'll wait here. Keep watching.
They're coming out.
Check the number plate
and follow the van.
- I'll go and take a look.
- Right.
Let's go.
- Where are you going?
- To take a look.
- Be careful.
- I will.
I see.
Detective Chan,
they've shaken off our unit.
They'll come back. Call them off.
Come back here.
- Don't shoot! It's me!
- Be quiet.
- You scared me.
- I fell over.
Someone's up there.
Hold it!
Turn around.
Police! Who are you?
The guy must be deaf and dumb.
Did you see three men
come through here a few hours ago?
You ask him.
Do you work here?
Do you sleep here?
Right. I got an answer
but I have no idea what it means.
- You ask him.
- Take him to the station.
It's OK. You're coming with me,
just for questions.
You don't need those.
Are all these toys in here yours?
- Stop!
- He can't hear you.
Help me find my gun.
Sir! Are you all right?
There's a deaf-mute running around -
find him.
Right!
- I didn't know he could fight.
- Neither did I. Go and find my gun.
If we can find the backing to finance
the buyout of Indian Ocean Bank,
it'll be a welcome addition
to our portfolio.
- Mr. Fung, telephone.
- I said no calls.
I know, but it's that man again.
Jimmy.
Excuse me.
- You called the cops.
- No, you must be mistaken.
Cut the crap.
We knew you'd go to the cops.
But we won't change our minds at all.
If you still agree to pay
the $20 million,
publish an ad for your company in one
of the newspapers tomorrow morning.
- Again.
- Where was the call from?
It was a modified mobile
so we couldn't trace it.
We knew you'd go the cops.
But it doesn't change things.
We'll show what we can do
with our explosives at 12 tomorrow.
We won't waste time
bargaining with you again.
Don't worry, they're bluffing.
We've sent extra officers
to protect your buildings.
You'll be fine.
This blackmail has gone on
long enough. It's time to act.
- I didn't grass you up!
- Really?
Why did they turn up
after you got caught?
Why did they let you go so easily?
Because they couldn't keep me
with no evidence.
I didn't grass you up, I swear!
It makes no difference,
we've made other arrangements.
- Where are we going?!
- You'll find out.
- Miss Wong.
- What is it?
- We've checked the mail.
- Thanks.
And these are for you.
Plant this bomb and we're even.
But...
Do the job or you're finished.
- Where shall I put it?
- I'll tell you later. Let's go.
Roger. Thanks a lot.
CID. Your case.
- Well?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Excuse me, CID. May I see your bag?
CID. May I see your bag?
- The red bag.
- Excuse me, CID.
Make it quick.
- It should be fine.
- Here's the mail, sir.
Roger.
- Do you think it's a bluff?
- I hope so, but we can't be sure.
Talk to you later.
Yes?
Tell her he's coming.
Roger.
Ka-kui, May's downstairs.
She wants to talk to you urgently.
Thanks.
May.
What's the matter?
I've written a letter for you. Bye.
May. You came all this way
to give me this?
It's important so keep it safe. Bye.
- Oh, yeah, where's the scooter?
- We didn't get along so I sold it.
I'll follow her.
I have my backup units in position.
Yes.
- I think they're bluffing.
- Thank you.
All right.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
What is going on?
Get an ambulance. Don't panic.
Ka-kui, come with me.
Call the fire department.
Come on!
- Bring a fire extinguisher.
- Come on.
- Put the fire out first.
- Come on, get moving.
Get out of here.
- Come on.
- Be careful.
- We need more help.
- Phone, sir.
- Bill, you take the phone call.
- Ka-kui, meet me upstairs.
I thought you were
supposed to protect me.
- What's up?
- Parcel bomb. Miss Wong lost an arm.
"Let Chi Yip Build
A Comfortable Home for You"
- How's Miss Wong?
- She's doing well.
The doctor said
her arm would recover.
They'll do a skin graft
on her face later.
So we'll wait and see.
Wong's decided to pay up.
What am I going to tell Raymond?
Uncle Bill, that's the way it goes.
We said it'd be a tough case.
We're dealing with
an organised bunch of criminals here.
I wish they'd blown me up instead.
I don't like putting lives at risk.
Don't worry. If they come and collect
the money, I'm sure we'll get them.
If I pass on what you said to
Raymond, he'll not be happy at all.
What we need is real action.
I guess you've seen the papers.
Now what do I tell the chief?
That's the way it goes.
We said it'd be a tough case.
We're dealing with
an organised bunch of criminals here.
I wish they'd blown me up instead.
I don't like putting lives at risk.
Don't worry. If they come and collect
the money, I'm sure we'll get them.
All this is talk,
what we need is some real action.
Something's up. Raymond's in trouble.
That's the way it goes.
We said it'd be a tough case.
We're dealing with
an organised bunch of criminals here.
I wish they'd blown me up instead.
I don't like putting lives at risk.
Don't worry. If they come and collect
the money, I'm sure we'll get them.
I understand your situation
and I'll note it in the report.
Good luck with the case.
You come, too.
Why the long face?
Did you two have a fight?
Right! But it's the last one.
Yes? I'll get him. Hold this.
- Ka-kui, phone.
- Put it through.
Right. Put it through.
- Hello.
- Ka-kui.
- May's been kidnapped!
- When?
We'd just left the shop
and someone lifted her into a van.
Who did it?
I don't know. But it must be
something to do with you.
Could it be those thugs again?
Chu Tu.
- Ka-kui...
- Hello?
Ka-kui!
- What's up?
- An old score.
- What?
- He's a bastard!
Ka-kui!
- What happened?
- He ran out.
What's the matter?
Sign this cheque before you're dead.
- Please stop.
- Let me finish.
We did what you asked. You won't need
any money when you're dead.
Chu Tu!
- Chu Tu!
- Hey, you!
Chu Tu!
Chu Tu!
Where is May?
I don't know.
I didn't do anything. It's him.
Where the hell's May?
Stop it! He's sick. Put him down.
- Where did you take her?
- I didn't take her.
- Who did then?
- I was very nasty to you before.
But now I'm sick and penniless.
- Why would I take her?
- He's got no money now.
It has nothing to do with us.
He made your life miserable.
Then who could it be?
There's a phone over there.
- Don't die before you sign this!
- Listen!
- Don't bother me again.
- He's nearly dead, so I won't.
Then again, maybe I will.
Good one!
- Hello?
- Ka-kui!
May!
You recognise her voice. We're at
the Hung Fung Industrial Building.
Who is this? What do you want?
Come alone or she's dead.
Wait!
Wait.
I know where it is.
May!
Are you all right?
- Be quiet.
- Are you all right?
I'm OK. Why have you kidnapped her?
"Ka-kui, by the time you read
this letter..."
Stop!
- "I've decided we should be apart."
- No.
"I don't think I'll see you again."
It's a love letter!
Just like they say,
"Unlucky in love, lucky in money."
- There's more.
- Bastard!
"When we met, I thought
you liked your job very much
"and you'd be my Mr. Right.
"Now I realise the only thing that
matters in your life is your work.
"I tell myself that what
made me fall in love with you
"is also what
made me want to leave you."
Yeah, why? Why did you break up?
"You told me that you didn't
want me involved with your work,
"but I didn't mind.
"You never spent
enough time with me.
"Being with you was
the happiest time in my life.
"But when you weren't there,
it was the worst time of my life."
That's not right.
"If I didn't leave you, I'd spend my
life waiting for you to come home..."
Can't you stop it?!
- She's crying!
- So is he.
- Keep reading, go on.
- Go on.
"...because you can
never stop being a policeman."
- A policeman who never stops.
- We're in trouble.
"I think it's the right decision.
"Please forgive me for making
such a selfish choice, May."
- What do you want?
- We want you to help us get rich.
Our speciality is blackmail and the
hardest part of it is the pick up.
- You'll collect the ransom for us.
- No way!
- You don't have a choice.
- He said no.
I think you'll enjoy this.
Stop!
Don't!
Stop it! Please!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please stop it!
Ka-kui, are you hurt?
Don't worry.
So you want to play the hero?
Now it's your turn.
Please don't!
Now he's in the right position.
You rotten swine!
Nice one!
- Kill me if you have the guts.
- So tough!
Really? Let's see if his girl
is tough, too.
What do you want?
How's that?!
How's that?
Enough! You've made your point.
- Does that mean you'll do it?
- Just let her go. I'll do anything.
We won't let her go
unless you help us.
- What do you want me to do?
- Collect the money for us.
You don't have any choice.
- I'll do it.
- Good man.
I wouldn't advise you to remove it.
Break one wire
and the whole thing blows.
The same thing happens
if I press this button.
You'd better be careful.
Ka-kui.
Be careful.
I'll come back for you.
- Ready?
- He's on the line.
- Trace the call.
- I'll get Uncle Bill.
Is the money ready?
We'll collect it in 15 minutes.
- It's ready.
- Did you call the cops?
No.
- Where's Ka-kui?
- I can't find him.
How could he be so irresponsible?
- I can't wait. Don't take any risks.
- Let's go.
You'll have 15 minutes
to get back here again.
No tricks.
If we don't get our money,
your vest will go "bang!"
We'll be waiting.
Get going.
Good luck.
- Yes?
- Police officers.
- Ka-kui, the boss was looking...
- Ka-kui!
It's Ka-kui.
- Ka-kui!
- Out of my way.
- Ka-kui!
- Let me go!
- Ka-kui!
- Get out of my way!
Ka-kui!
Excuse me.
Ka-kui.
- Ka-kui, where have you been?
- Never mind.
- I'm here to collect the money.
- What?!
- Is he your man?
- Yes, he is.
- Ka-kui, what's going on?
- We don't have much time. The money!
- What are you doing?
- Ka-kui!
- Move and I'll shoot you.
- Don't pull the trigger.
- No!
- Don't push me.
If you shoot me, everybody here...
will be blown sky high.
If one wire breaks,
the whole thing will explode.
Ka-kui, what's going on?
Can't we work this out?
If I don't leave here in 10 minutes,
it will go off.
I don't have time!
Let him go.
Please leave us.
Attention all units,
don't stop Ka-kui.
- I think he did it.
- Great.
- Looks like he was followed.
- Let's go.
Tell him to move up.
- Give me the money.
- I'm being followed.
Let me shake them off first.
I'll meet you later.
Are the cops behind us?
Stay back! Don't come near.
Why did you stop here?
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?
A bomb's about to blow. Run!
A bomb! Run!
- There's no cops!
- I'll blow him to bits.
Wait! What about the money?
And you can't get a radio signal
in the tunnel.
- What now?
- We've got the girl. Don't worry.
Let's go.
Maybe we should split up.
You wait here.
Kill her if it goes wrong.
Where is she?
Look, he's back.
I told you he wouldn't play tricks.
May!
Quiet.
- Freeze! You're under arrest.
- Really?
- Come on then, arrest us.
- Don't move.
Move and I'll shoot you.
You think so? You'd have to
shoot fast. There are three of us.
Think about it.
If I don't shoot you,
you'll only spend years in jail.
That doesn't sound too bad,
we might take your advice.
But we're still young.
After we did our time,
we'd all be old men.
- Don't push me!
- Run! This is a fireworks factory.
- May!
- I'm over here!
Are you all right?
Ka-kui, be careful!
Good work!
Ka-kui! Come here!
There's the rubbish chute.
Don't touch them, they're dangerous.
Get going.
- It looks too high.
- Just jump.
Ka-kui, are you all right?
- I'm fine. Get out of here, May.
- Be careful.
Do you want to try this yourself?
You want some more? Take this.
And more, bastard.
Want some more?
You want some more? Here!
Bastard!
More?
Not enough...
Shit.
Ka-kui!
Stop crying, OK?
Look, the fireworks are beautiful.
