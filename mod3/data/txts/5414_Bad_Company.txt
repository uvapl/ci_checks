Your friend is late.
He'll be here.
Oh, yeah?
I do have other bidders.
I personally vouch for this man.
Oh, well.
I trust you, Michael, but...
you see, with each degree of separation
comes a degree of uncertainty.
Mr. Turner.
Mr. Vas.
The KGB once tried to set me up.
So I had to kill
three of their agents...
and then I hunted down
their families.
The point is, if I sense
anything out of the ordinary--
No, the point is, I haven't
seen anything from you yet...
to justify a payment
of $20 million.
So before I hand over
a small fortune and risk my life...
I want to know 100% that you can
in fact deliver a device.
That's the point.
Very well.
Michelle.
Owner's manual.
This is your show of good faith?
Well, you're still alive. You'll
consider that a show of good faith.
Now, what do you have for me?
Down payment--
one million dollars.
So, when do I get the device?
Let's say ten days.
Michael, you take that telephone...
and I will call you
and tell you how to proceed.
But keep it on you all the time.
As for you, sir,
the next time we meet...
I suggest you be on time.
Nice coat.
Well done.
See you around.
- So far, so good?
- Yeah, so far.
- Kevin's got a tail.
- Is it Vas?
No, they don't look Russian.
They don't look friendly.
We'd better go back for him.
You ordered us not to
jeopardize our cover, sir.
Hey, turn left.
Turn left!
Kill him.
- Ambush on the castle steps, sir.
- Coming fast.
Let's go.
Get down! Get down!
Get down. Get down.
Get down.
Get down.
There he is. Pull over.
You're jeopardizing the mission.
You are the mission.
God, that was close.
Did you see who they were?
Kevin?
Doesn't this all smack
of extreme desperation?
A nuclear bomb that fits neatly
into a carry-on suitcase?
Kevin spends two years getting
close to these people...
in order to position you
as the buyer.
Vas won't deal with anyone else.
We have nine days to make this work.
I'd say desperation
was the order of the day.
Maybe Vas set Kevin up.
My guess is it's a rival buyer.
Could be Pakistanis, Chechens,
North Koreans.
- Libyans.
- Try the entire Middle East.
Adrik Vas is a businessman.
He'll take anyone's money.
So why kill Kevin
if they could just outbid him?
'Cause we have deeper pockets, that's
why. He priced them out of the game.
- Who do you think it is?
- Well, the Cold War is over.
These guys don't wave flags any more.
and fanaticism, terrorism is global.
Well, whoever it is decided
to eliminate the competition...
and force Vas to deal with them.
So the future
of the so-called free world...
may rest in this
young man's hands.
Jake Hayes here. Big Time Tickets.
Whatever you want, I can get you.
Yankees, third base line.
Nicks, court side. Rangers, on the ice.
Masters, I'll put you
on Tiger's teeth, all right?
No matter what you want,
I got it for you.
Big Time Tickets,
what you need?
Oh, come on, man.
You gonna call me three hours before
a tip off against the Lakers?
The Knicks sell out
every game, money.
Since I like you, for 850
I can get you section 24, row nine.
Twelve back from the bench.
Right behind Woody with
a good view of Spike...
unless he got that turban thing on his
head lookin' like Yassar "AraNick."
Check.
Yo, hold on a second.
What's up? Big Time Tickets, Jake Hayes.
What you want? Checkmate.
Lion King?
I can't do that.
Jake Hayes here.
Big Time Tickets.
Mr. Johnson, you gonna go to the game
tonight or you wanna do some business?
Shit. He's kicking your ass.
Hey, don't look at me.
You need to watch that castle
about to bitch-slap your bishop.
- You lose, Opie.
- Damn!
Okay, so I'll give you
400 for the tip.
- Yo, Jake. Let's get a slice.
- Hold on a second.
Hello, Big Time Tickets.
Hey. Hey, man.
I can't go.
You always working.
Hey, honey.
What's up?
Okay, I'm gonna pick you up from
work. Then we'll talk all about it.
Okay, I love you too. Bye.
I don't think I'm gonna go for that.
So check this out.
You're gonna do this, right?
Then I'm gonna do this.
Then you're gonna do this.
Then I'm gonna do this.
Then you're gonna want to do this.
But I'm gonna do this.
And when you're thinking about
doing this, I'm gonna do this.
And then the game's over. So why
don't you give me $20 right now...
and we'll save 20 minutes.
Screw you.
You didn't know chess
was a contact sport, did you?
Hey, honey.
Julia Benson.
A Nurse's aide.
They've been together three years.
She lives with her sister
and brother-in-law in Jersey City.
- Amazing resemblance to Kevin, sir.
- Yeah.
Like seeing a ghost.
I don't-- I don't know
how you're gonna react.
Come on. Wait a minute.
I should have known.
The mood swings.
The weight gain.
What weight gain?
You're pregnant.
You're pregnant.
I want everybody to know.
Hey, everybody.
My woman's having a baby,
and we're getting married.
All right.
I'm not pregnant.
You know, we don't have to get married.
I mean, marriage is a big step.
We should wait a while.
We're young.
I'm moving to Seattle.
Seattle, like,
Seattle Supersonics, Seattle?
Wait a minute.
That's-That's-That's pretty far.
I got offered a job there.
What kind of job are you gonna get in
Seattle that you can't get in New York?
A friend of mine
from junior college called and--
- Who?
- Kenneth.
Your ex-man Ken.
Look, he's managing a company
out there, and he offered.
- So you're leaving me
and going back to Ken?
- No.
- Are you leaving me?
- Sort of, but it's not--
So you're leaving me and going back
to Kenneth. That's what I asked you.
The Ken part is just business.
And what's the
leaving me part, pleasure?
Pain.
Your sister put you up to this.
She never liked me.
- It's been three years, Jake.
- I know it's been three years.
And we're in the same situation
that we were in when we met.
Meaning we're not married?
We're not married.
We can't afford to get married.
And it doesn't look like
it's ever gonna change.
You know, poor people do get married.
I know, but I don't feel like fighting
with you every day because we're broke.
I mean, marriage is hard enough
without being poor.
Hey, what happened to the love?
What happened to all that romance?
You know I love you.
But you are living in this fantasy.
It's like you're waiting
for some kind of miracle.
I gotta live in reality.
I am not gonna be young forever.
Oh, I see, so you gotta
put yourself back on the market...
while the merchandise is still fresh?
You act like there's a damn
expiration date on your forehead.
Come on, come on.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Come on, you think
I like living like this?
Moving tickets, hustling cheques,
deejaying at these little clubs.
I know, I should have stayed in college.
I messed up. I messed up.
I'll go back to college.
I love you, Jake.
I love you too.
But I--
So when are you leaving?
A couple weeks,
but w-we'll talk before then.
Why?

That's right.
I want you to come back

Julie, Julie, I'm sorry--
Oh, I'm sorry.
Big Time Tickets.
Yeah, for what game?
Well, how much you wanna spend?
Yeah, I can get it.
So where you at?
Where the hell's that?
- Thank you very much. Now take off.
- Whatever.
- Hop out. - Hey, what's up?
- Give me your phone.
What's up?
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
- Relax.
- What y'all want?
- Hey, come on, come on, come on.
- Hey, relax.
You know how hard it was for me
to get that cab to come up here?
I hope y'all are
giving me a ride back.
Come on. I know you're cops, man.
What do you want, money?
Oh, I understand. Y'all shot somebody,
and now y'all need a suspect.
Mr. Hayes, Jacob Hayes.
I'm Officer Oakes.
That's Officer Seale.
Officer Swanson.
Officer Carew.
What, CIA? What's that for,
"crackers in my ass"?
You gonna arrest me
for scalping tickets?
We just want to talk to you
about something.
- About what?
- About your brother.
You've got the wrong guy.
I don't even have a brother.
That's just a picture of me in a suit.
Could've got that off the Internet.
I saw a picture of Bill Gates
with three titties on the Net.
Okay, September the 8th, 1970.
Bellevue Hospital, New York City.
A woman registered as Mary Jeffries
gives birth to identical twins...
but suffers complications
during labour and dies the next day.
- What about their father?
- Thomas B. Jeffries.
Presumed alive.
Whereabouts unknown.
"The state rarely separates twins,
but one of the infants, Jacob"--
that's you--
"was diagnosed
with severe lung infection."
You still have the scar from the chest.
You have the incision mark.
An administrator at the hospital
altered the birth record...
to give the healthy child
a better chance at adoption.
A week later, Roger and Glenda Pope
took in Kevin Jeffries.
The Popes never knew.
Kevin never knew.
So I have a twin brother. Big deal.
What does the CIA have to do with this?
What, he couldn't send me a letter?
Your brother's dead.
- How?
- A helicopter crash.
We need your help, Mr. Hayes.
Your brother was working
on something with us.
- My twin brother was CIA?
- Yeah, a clandestine operative.
And just before he was killed,
he set up a deal.
- What kind of deal?
- A very important one.
So we need you to stand in for him,
uh, you know, just briefly.
- Pretend I'm him?
- Yeah.
- For how long?
- Nine days.
Nine days? That's not standin' in.
You know, standin' in is like an hour.
Nine days?
That's like going on tour.
Is this shit dangerous?
- Yeah, there's some risk.
- Well, what kind of risk?
We talking bad credit risk,
or bullet in the ass risk?
You'd be well compensated.
For bullet in the ass risk? I hope
that's a lot of compensation. How much?
- Throw out a number.
- A billion dollars.
- You've overshot.
- I don't know what kind of budget
you're working with.
Well, we were thinking somewhere
in the region of, let's say...
uh, $25,000.
Fifty. Yeah, fifty.
I figure you started with 25,
so I know you got more...
and you ain't gonna give me
all your money-- 50,000.
This is what I'm thinking, Mr. Hayes.
With $25,000...
your girlfriend Julie
could go to college.
- She wouldn't have to go to Seattle.
- Or work with Ken.
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
You're gonna give me
$50,000, tax free.
Okay, 50,000 after tax,
after the job is done.
Half now, half after.
Ten now, 40 after.
Unless my mother had triplets,
you're gonna give me ten now, 90 after.
Okay, you've got a deal.
- So when do we start?
- Now.
- This is your brother's file. Study it.
- So there's homework?
- This is your brother's file. Study it.
- So there's homework?
- Preparation.
- Okay.
Let's see. Dad sits on the board
of New York Stock Exchange.
Mom, co-artistic director
at Lincoln Center.
Hmm, must've been nice.
In my foster house, we was so poor,
we used to lick stamps for dinner.
Let's see. Prep--
Prep school at Exeter.
Then college at Dartmouth.
Served in the naval academy.
- That's right.
- What did he serve, lunch?
Oh, man. Rhodes scholar.
- So my brother was real smart, huh?
- Yeah.
Damn, the CIA is cheap.
Y'all could have at least gotten me
a queen-size. What's this, jack-size?
Hey, uh, what does that
"Zaz-nod" mean?
It's Czech for bathroom.
You'll find the room labelled
with phonetic translations.
Why?
'Cause the deal goes down
in the Czech Republic.
- Czech Republic?
- Here's a dictionary.
Hey, how do I get a outside line?
I need somebody to feed my cat.
You don't have an outside line,
and you don't have a cat.
Okay, so what am I
supposed to be doing here?
There's a tape in the VCR.
It's a video of your brother.
Watch it. The way he talks
and the way he moves.
I know there's a lot to deal with here,
but we're all behind you.
We'll start in the morning.
You got any questions?
Yeah. If my brother was such a genius,
then how come he's dead?
5:00 a.m.
Hey, I don't do 5:00 a.m.
So bottom line,
what are our chances?
Well, I'd say anywhere
between, uh, nil and zero.
- Why do you say that?
- Well, I grant you he's got potential.
He's pretty street smart.
In six months, he could probably fool his
brother's own parents. But eight days?
Come on,
you've gotta be kidding.
Probably get himself killed on this mission
and anyone else who goes along with him.
Would you like to be
replaced on the mission?
Why, are you saying you're
going ahead with or without me?
Yeah, that's precisely what I'm saying.
Well, sir. When do I tell him
what this mission involves?
Well, if I were you,
I would tell him as little as possible.
Don't put anything
into his head he can't use.
And certainly nothing
that could pop out at the wrong time.
- Okay.
- What's he doing now?
He's studying. We told him to learn
a few key phrases in Czech.
Well, he seems dedicated.
What's he saying?
He said, "I haven't had my period
in three months."
Now what?
"Where's the hospital?
I have a vaginal infection."
Yeah, this is gonna be
really interesting.
Can't wait to get started.
Rise and shine, Mr. Hayes.
5:00 a.m. and all is well.
How about three more hours
of sleep and some breakfast?
How about a nice shower?
Hey, hey, hey! What are you--
What's wrong with you?
Morning.
Today we'll be covering
basic operations protocol...
for the acquisition of foreign assets.
A procedure we like to call
"the three I's."
Identifying the target,
initiating the contact...
and infiltrating the network.
- Now you do it like him.
- These three steps--
Man, this is buggin' me out.
I feel like Michael Jackson
looking at old album covers.
I mean, look at this guy.
He looks like me, but it's not me.
Yeah.
So what did he like to do? I mean,
what kind of sports was he into?
What kind of music did he listen to?
He liked music.
He liked jazz and classical.
Classical, like Run DMC?
- He didn't like rap.
- Oh, come on, man.
What 29-year-old brother
don't like a little bit of rap?
He didn't listen to rap.
- So what kind of sports was he into?
- Skiing.
Okay, so you got skiing,
the navy, no rap.
You know, we would have
had a lot in common.
- Sir.
- Hmm?
- That meeting's about to start.
- What time?
Uh, well.
Okay. All right.
Thanks.
- So what's up with you and Swanson?
- Hmm?
Aw, come on, man. I see
there's something going on there.
Y'all got a little something
going on. Come on, now.
Look at you. You're blushing.
Do you mind if I say something
to you, Mr. Hayes?
My friends, Officer Seale,
Officer Swanson...
they have faith in you.
I don't. And that creates a problem
because you're in so deep with us now...
we can never let you go.
So you'd better learn this stuff stone
cold by 0500 hours tomorrow morning.
Or what?
I'll kill you.
Hey, could we start
a few hours later tomorrow?
- Get dressed.
- It's 4:59.
The new terror's in rock, rock
On every block, block
Late for school, late for work
But ahead of these cops, cops
My credit is shot
Into debt, in the box, box
Right, they took my life
and that's pathetic as pots
Right away blow your life away
So light your haze
Hold tight grenades
So when it blows I'm slightly grazed
Either might be crazed
unleashing unlikely rage
But next time you hear a verse
from me I might be caged
Swirl, checking for sediment.
Sniff.
And taste.
Morning, Mr. Hayes.
- 5:00 a.m.
- No, 5:01 .
I believe in people trying
I believe in people crying
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being
Pope, Kevin Pope.
Man, look at this suit.
Man, I got initials on my cuffs.
Normally, the only thing I ever have
on my cuffs is steak sauce.
They say, "MT."
What's that for?
Michael Turner.
But I thought it was Kevin Pope.
Kevin Pope is Michael Turner.
Michael Turner
is Kevin Pope's cover identity.
He's a very successful, very
knowledgeable and very sophisticated...
international dealer
in fine antiquities.
Well, if I'm Jake Hayes playing
Kevin Pope playing Michael Turner...
then I should get two cheques.
Cheers.
This is a very rare, expensive cognac.
What do you think?
Dry.
But never precocious.
I love your shirt.
Egyptian broadcloth?
Three days. Pretty impressive.
Yeah, he's bright.
I think he can do it.
He's got my vote.
I said he was bright. I didn't say
he was capable of saving the world.
- Let's run a real test.
- Like what?
Send him up to New York,
put him in Kevin's apartment.
Let the neighbours, the doorman,
everybody get a look at him.
- See if they buy him as Michael Turner.
- It might even serve a double purpose.
Whoever tried to kill Kevin as Michael
Turner probably doesn't know he's dead.
- They might still be looking for him.
- So we dangle him, use him as bait...
- keep him in the dark?
- He'll be protected.
What do we tell him?
Tell him you're giving him
a chance to practice being Kevin.
That's all you need to tell him.
You're the boss.
You see the van in front of us?
The one behind us?
Those are our guys.
Here's my cell phone number. Use it
if you get into any kind of trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
- Any kind.
Shark attack, call you. All right.
Could you pop the trunk?
Take this. Get yourself some shoes.
Dirty punk.
- Mr. Turner, welcome back, sir.
- Thanks, Tim.
- How was Europe?
- Like another country.
You could put this on MTVCribs.
Man, this is dope.
God.
So if I paid taxes, this is
where the money would go, huh?
You could have
a puppet party in here.
Let's get a little music in here.
- What's that music?
- It's this hip hop stuff.
It's terrible.
Jake, it's your downstairs neighbour,
Mrs. Patterson.
Don't forget the radio.
Okay.
Hi, Michael.
Welcome back.
- Vera, how are you?
- Fine. Fine, thank you.
- Hi, Annabella.
- We just came in and
the doorman said you were back.
- Annabella missed you.
- Oh, you're far too kind.
I've been waiting desperately
for you to come back.
Oh, why?
I bought a little treasure. Come on down
and tell me if I got a good buy.
- Oh, okay.
- Hold your baby.
- Yes, my baby.
- How was your trip?
- Uh.
- This is gonna be a disaster.
Go see your nanny, baby.
What do you think?
- Is it a good piece?
- Uh.
- It's exquisite.
- What do you think?
Go ahead pick it up, feel it.
See how delicate it is.
Uh, pick it up, right?
Yes, just grab it and pick it up.
Michael...
that's what we keep the doggy treats in.
Of course. I knew that.
I was just getting it out of the way.
- So I could see the--
- The vase.
The vase, of course, the vase, yes.
Uh, may I ask,
how much did you pay for this?
- 150,000
- Good lord!
What you gonna
put in it, cocaine?
He fooled the doorman,
he fooled the neighbour
and he fooled the neighbor’s dog.
- What more do you want?
- Oakes, we need to know
who's after that bomb.
You're willing
to sacrifice him to find out?
Don't be dramatic.
He's got plenty of protection.
I'll tell you when to pull him.
Hope you're not watching this.
I don't have to watch this,
do I, sir?
- Oh, no. Holy shit.
- Code red. Code red.
Code red. Code red.
Parish, McCain, cover the exits.
Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Sir, he's headed for the roof.
- We need him alive.
- Yes, sir.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Watch it!
- Oh, my.
Drop the knife.
Hey, Elvis. If you drop the knife and
step down, no one is gonna hurt you.
So, who's got Jake?
Well, these last ten minutes
will be used as a teaching aid...
- on how an operation can get totally--
- Screwed up, sir?
- Thank you.
- We'll find him, sir.
-Yeah, where are you?
-At the corner of Eat Shit and Fuck You.
I'm not gonna let you trace me.
Bye, I'll call you back.
I'm stuck in traffic.
I just want one simple thing.
Give me that.
Okay. Run fingerprints,
DNA, anything we can get
on the guy who jumped off the roof.
- Yes, sir.
- He looks Afghans, sir.
-Don't assume anything. Just find Jake.
-Yes, sir.
-Jake.
My brother was murdered like
they were gonna murder me, right?
Let's meet someplace
and I'll tell you--
No more bullshit!
We lost him because we lied to him.
No, you lost him because you lost him.
We treated him like an idiot.
He had a right to know
what we were doing with him.
We're wasting time.
Find him and bring him back
and spare me your conscience.
Spare my conscience.
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Thanks a lot.
Six million ways to live
Six, six, six million ways to live life
- Yeah.
- Hello, hello? Hey, Pam.
- It's Jake. Can I talk to Julie?
- She don't wanna talk to you.
- Who's on the phone?
- Hey, Pam. I-I need to talk to Julie.
Please, please. This is serious.
Is it Jake? Wait.
Let me talk to him.
- She's moving on.
- Give me the phone.
We don't need
no more trouble, Jake, okay?
And you ain't nothing but trouble.
- Pam.
- Two suits came around here
today looking for you.
Give me the phone.
Hey, hey, hey. Shit.
Your phone's tapped.
Your phone's tapped.
Okay, if Julie's there,
tell her I love her.
And Oakes, if you're listening,
kiss my ass.
- You get a trace?
- No.
He hung up.
Six million ways to live
Six, six, six million ways to live life
Mr. Hayes, where are you?
A whole lot to give, yo
So we grab life
-Where in the hell are you?
-But there's six million ways
to live lavish
Beyond all the misery
and mathematics
- But there's six million ways to live
- I'll see y'all next week.
- Six million, million
- Six million ways to live
- Six million, million
- But there's six million
ways to live lavish
Beyond all the misery
and mathematics
But there's six million ways to live
Six million ways to live
- Mom.
- Help.
- Mom. Mom.
- Help.
- Help.
- Mom. Mom. Mom.
- Help. Somebody--
- Mom, please.
- Help. Help.
- It's me. Ma, it's me. It's me!
-Jackie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You gonna break my arm.
Well, what are you doing in the dark?
- Some people are looking for me.
- What did you do?
- What did you do?
- I didn't do nothing. I didn't
do nothing. I didn't do nothing.
It's not what you think.
It's not the police.
It's way too hard to explain.
Look at this.
Eight foster kids I've taken
into my house over the years.
And all of them made something
of themselves, and not one
of them had your potential.
- Come on, Ma.
- Selling and scrambling and hustling.
Ma, did you know I had a brother?
Oh, stop talking crazy.
You had lots of brothers.
How's that nice girl
I met last Christmas?
She left me.
Hand me that umbrella
so I can hit you again.
You know, Mom,
maybe it wasn't my fault.
- You need money?
- No.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I need money.
How much do you need?
I won $250 at Bingo.
It's just-- It's just for a little
while. I'll pay you back.
Yeah, I know.
You want something to eat?
You know what?
I really gotta go.
I'm never giving up on you, Jackie.
You're gonna do something
to make me very proud one day.
I know it.
I owe you an apology.
You hear me?
I was just wondering how many
of your people are listening in.
No, we're alone.
No cameras, no wires.
Just me.
- You've got the floor.
- Your brother was assassinated.
By the same guys who came
after me, right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Doing the same job as you.
- Which is what?
- Your brother as Michael Turner...
was helping me buy something
off the black market.
What-What, Cuban cigars,
PlayStation Three?
- What?
- I can't tell you if you're
not coming back in with us.
Well, I'm not coming back in with you
if you ain't telling me.
Your brother died saving my life.
Did you know that?
I wish it had been otherwise,
but that's the way it is.
How are his parents taking it?
You didn't tell his parents?
No, and that's the way we want it.
How would you feel if you died
and nobody told your wife?
I'm not married.
- What, there's no Mrs. Spy?
- Not any more.
Relationships and attachments
are useless in this business.
So that's how this job is?
Even if they don't shoot you,
they take your life?
I know it sounds hokey,
but I honestly believe...
our lives are about something
bigger than ourselves and...
I'm offering you a chance
to commit yourself to something.
You ain't offering me nothing
but a chance at a bullet in my ass.
I don't see the higher meaning in that.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
I'm going outside, and I'm gonna
sit in the car and I'll count to ten.
And if you want to join me, fine.
And if not, I'll tell the agency
I couldn't find you.
We can't pull this job off without you.
We need you.
Think about it.
Oh, well. Well,
that didn't work, did it?
No.
What, "I'm gonna go outside
and count to ten"?
Who the hell are you?
You would have done better with,
"Bitch, get in the car."
Okay. Get in the car, bitch.
This is the man who tried to kill you.
We now know that he's a member of a
multinational terrorist organization...
led by this man.
Meet the man who killed
your brother, Dragan Adjanic.
He's wanted by the Hague for
terrorist crimes against humanity...
so he's a fugitive everywhere
in the world including his own country.
He calls his movement
"The Black Hand."
His members take a death pledge,
becoming suicide soldiers
to further their cause.
Last year, the FBI caught four of
his men in a Washington DC motel...
with enough uraninitrate
to level the Capitol building.
He doesn't like America
and he doesn't like you.
- Wait a minute, what did I do?
- He's your rival buyer.
For the item that this man has to sell.
This is Adrik Vas.
He's a Russian, ex-army colonel,
kingpin in the Russian mafia.
He's up to his neck in prostitution,
drugs and extortion.
That sounds like anybody
I went to high school with.
This is Vas's right-hand man.
His name is Michelle Petrov,
otherwise known as "The Hammer."
Remember these faces because
you're gonna be seeing them soon.
Why do they call this guy,
"The Hammer"?
- What?
- Good evening. Isn't this fun?
This is an exercise known as Kim's game.
It's meant to test your awareness.
What can you tell me
about your attackers?
They woke me up.
Look, man, if you want me to spy,
I'm gonna need my rest.
- How many were there?
- Didn't I just say they woke me up?
Yeah, that's the weird thing
about an ambush.
Next time, we'll try and warn you.
- Do you understand
what happened to you just now?
- Yeah, I was jacked.
No, you panicked.
When you thought you were in danger,
your brain shut down.
So what's the point of having a good
brain if you can't keep it operating?
My brain didn't shut down.
I knew it was Swanson
'cause I could feel her tits on my back.
I knew it was Carew...
'cause his breath smelled like shit,
probably from kissing your ass so much.
I knew it was Seale
because I took his wallet.
Hey, Seale, why does
a married man need a condom?
Your wife know?
You wanna know
how I knew it was you?
Okay, thank you.
Game's over. Good night.
Where you going?
You're gonna leave like that, huh?
Come back.
Y'all got me up.
Let's do something.
Let's hit a club or something.
Based on our
intelligence projections...
and the text manual
provided by Agent Pope...
this is a mock-up
of what you'll be buying.
Does it play DVDs?
It's a portable thermonuclear weapon.
- So that's a bomb.
- It's a reproduction.
Last year, a Russian suitcase bomb
was stolen from a dismantling facility
in the Ural Mountains.
Your brother tracked it down.
We need you to recover it.
Two things you're gonna have to do.
Would one of them be
shitting in my pants?
Welcome to Prague.
Looks like Newark.
- Welcome back to the hotel, Mr. Turner.
- Thank you.
Mr. Turner, so glad
to have you back, sir.
Thank you, Lempenka.
I hope you haven't given out my room.
Certainly not, sir.
This is beautiful.
Her name is Lenka.
You just called her "Lempenka,"
which means "cardboard."
Wow, wow.
Man, it's gonna be hard
to go back to Jersey.
We'll be in the suite across the hall.
We have full video and
audio surveillance of this room.
All right now, when I go to the
bathroom, press the pause button.
Just stay in the room.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Yeah, excepting my little date
with a nuclear bomb.
Okay, this is our lifeline.
Our only link to Adrik Vas.
Nothing happens till he calls.
Don't let it out of your sight.
And remember, from now on...
there's no Jake, there's no Kevin,
only Michael Turner.
Man. I think I'm gonna like
being Michael Turner.
I think maybe you wanna
take a look at this.
Okay, what the hell's he up to now?
Hey, fish egg?
- They're good, man.
- Beluga, sir.
It's 12,000 crowns an ounce.
- Party's over.
- No, the party just started.
Soon as y'all leave,
I'm gonna have my ass buffed.
This little piggy go to market.
Make sure you put
my initials on the big toe.
People need to know
whose feet this is.
That's Vas.
Where's the cell phone?
Phone, phone, phone, phone, phone.
Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah, we'll be there.
It's Vas.
The deal's on in an hour.
Now your eye.
Now your eye.
Look right into the computer screen.
Wait for confirmation.
- Okay, that's it.
- All right, from this point on...
only you will be able
to access your computer.
It won't operate without
your retinal signature, your eyes.
So, when they show you the bomb,
connect your laptop.
Determine if the bomb is the real thing.
And take enough time doing it so Welles
can download their arming codes.
And hopefully their disarming codes
into our computer.
Good luck, Mr. Hayes.
We have visual.
You'll do fine. Everyone's
nervous the first day of school.
I always cut the first day of school.
Don't worry.
We're covered from every angle.
Can't wait to meet the Hammer.
These guys must be the toolbox.
- Should we move in, sir?
- No.
Not till we're sure they brought
the bomb. There's too much at stake.
Nice coat.
Gentlemen, are we going
to do business or aren't we?
That depends, Michael. Where
have you been for the last nine days?
- I don't believe that concerns you.
- On the contrary.
It concerns me very much.
We make a deal, you disappear.
Doesn't look good, my friend.
Heads up, McCain. Be advised.
Targets are armed.
Maintain your positions.
Everyone, maintain your position.
Copy that, sir.
- Do we have a problem?
- I don't know.
You tell me
do we have a problem?
Do we?
Give me the cell phone
I gave you earlier.
Don't worry.
I only made collect calls.
Look, I don't know
what this is about, but--
No, you don't.
So shut up.
Neither does Mr. Turner.
You see, this cell phone
has a global positioning system.
In a moment, it'll tell me exactly
where you've been the last nine days.
Fantastic, eh?
Oh, well.
Haven't you been busy?
Oh, you get around.
Berlin, Rome, Zurich.
And not one decent
treasure to show for it.
Well, where's the money?
- Where's the product?
- Nearby.
So how do we do this?
I'm gonna call you on this cell phone.
Then you have one hour
to get the money, Michael.
Then I will call you again
and tell you where to bring it to.
-You understand?
-Well, I'm gonna have to run some tests.
So make sure you bring
authentic merchandise.
Fair enough. I wouldn't buy a car
without checking under the hood.
- Are we agreed?
- Yes.
No, we're not bringing
money anywhere.
- No?
- I'll have someone transfer
the remaining 19 million...
when Mr. Turner tells us
we have a viable device.
It can be done by computer.
One of my men will be
standing by at this address.
You will send one of your brain trust
to verify the money's in your account.
- And that's it.
- We'll give you a hostage?
Yeah, and you'll get one.
We'll call it a security deposit...
which neither of us will get back
if we screw up or if we leave a mess.
It's that simple.
Now we have an agreement, I think.
Agreed.
Don't you go disappearing
on me again, Michael.
Hey, you did real well, Mr. Hayes.
Hey, you did real well, Mr. Hayes.
-You knew they wouldn't bring it, right?
-Uh-huh.
Standard procedure. Guys like him won't
risk getting screwed on the first date.
And what if you hadn't
changed the chip in the phone?
Well, it would have told him
that the phone...
had already travelled
to CIA headquarters in Langley...
and they'd have shot
both of us in the heads.
- I'm hungry. How about you?
- I think I'm gonna pass.
Good night.
Even if I
Forget why
You'll always give me
Another reason
This is no empty promise
I can depend upon it
You'll always love me
My God!
Hi.
This place comes
with everything, huh?
Could you, uh,
give me a towel?
Very funny.
I knew you'd be surprised.
I didn't think you'd be shocked.
Oh.
- Hey, you want some room service?
- No. I'd like a good, stiff drink.
- Oh, shit. It's Nicole.
- What?
This isn't exactly
the welcome I expected.
What's up?
Honey, I made dinner reservations
at our favourite place.
- I love that place.
- Honey, aren't you happy to see me?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Uh, I gotta get that.
I'll be right back.
- How are you doing?
- Well, you see how I'm doing.
- Yeah. We have a problem.
- Yeah. You know...
where I'm from, people pay a lot
of money for problems like that.
That's Nicole. That's Kevin's--
I mean, Michael's girlfriend.
- She works for CNN in Europe.
- So how come you didn't tell me
Michael had a girlfriend?
Well, they broke up several weeks ago.
They had a fight, and she walked out.
Well, it looks like she forgave him.
What the hell did he fight
with her fine ass for?
Well, apparently he had
intimacy problems.
He was distant.
Some kind of psychotherapy crap.
- Anyway, she went off
to cover the Balkans.
- Okay, so what do you want me to do?
Take her to dinner.
She's CNN.
- If you handle this badly,
she could blow your cover, okay?
- Okay.
Don't cheat, just eat.
Don't cheat, just eat.
Don't cheat, just eat.
Don't cheat, just eat.
That was Jehovah's Witnesses.
Don't cheat, just eat.
- Michael, I hope you're hungry, baby.
- She's willing to share
We're hoppin' in the whip
and we're leavin'here so
- Somebody gonna mix it up tonight
Somebody gonna mix it up tonight
- Yeah, I just gotta go brush my teeth.
Everybody gonna muck it up tonight
- One of these ladies
gonna be havin' my baby
- Ohhh.
Tonight
Hey, you've reached the residence
of Pam, Marvin, Julie and the kids.
- Leave a message at the tone.
-Julie, this is Jake. Are you there?
Okay, if you haven't left yet,
please wait for me.
Please, please.
I got a new job.
It's totally legit,
and I've changed.
I have totally changed.
I'm a new man.
I'm the man who loves you.
I love you. I love you so much.
I didn't even know how much
I loved you till two minutes ago.
- It's Jake.
- Honey, I am ready to do anything.
-Julie.
- I love him.
- I'm ready to make big sacrifices.
- No, you don't!
- Honey, what's taking you so long?
- Big sacrifices.
Please wait for me.
Please wait for me!
Jake, I heard you.
I heard every word, baby.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be right here.
I love you so much. Jake--
- If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.
-Jake? Hello? Jake?
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up--
I need to find a place
-A quiet space
- Thank you.
Where I can get over you
- 'Cause you're so far away
- So, are you gonna make me grovel?
No, not unless you want to.
- Is this fish?
- Yeah, of course. You love fish.
Uh, that's right. I love fish.
But that's before I became a vegetarian.
Uh, waiter, waiter.
I can't eat this.
Can you get me something else?
How 'bout a steak, medium-well?
- Please?
- Of course, sir.
- Oh, thanks a lot.
- I thought you were a vegetarian.
- Vegetarian?
I'll eat a pig's ass
if they cook it right.
But enough about me.
How 'bout those Balkans?
I missed you, Michael.
I'm sorry I left.
You're not for me
I try to tell myself
- What's the matter?
- There's somebody else.
There is?
When did that happen?
- Right after you left.
- I left you two weeks ago.
I mean, uh,
did you meet her here in Prague?
No, in Jersey.
- New Jersey?
- Yeah. I was in New York...
and Jersey's right next to New York
and I just took a little day trip.
Who is she?
What does she do?
Well, she's a nurse's aide
at St. Sebastian's Hospital.
Her name's Julie.
She's got curly hair.
I get it.
You want me to jump through a couple
of hoops before you take me back.
Okay. I have it coming.
- It's killing me
- But I'm willing to work for it.
Ohhh
You're not here with me
You are so sorry
Baby
I'm
Nicole!
You hurt me really bad.
And I can't just let you
yo-yo with my heart, okay?
You hurt me, and I'm never
gonna let it happen again.
Love don't live here any more!
Michael, I've never
seen you like this.
So... open.
So...
so in touch with your feelings.
Like you could really be in love
with a nurse from New Jersey.
I mean, you're just so much more,
mmm, warm and-and-and vulnerable...
- and, and funny.
- Is that like...
- funny--
- Yeah. No, you didn't
used to be funny before.
That's funny "ha-ha" funny, or funny
"this milk tastes funny" funny?
See? That's funny.
- You're not Michael Turner.
- Uh-oh.
-Jake and Nicole are back.
- Yeah, and they've got company.
Okay, let's join the party.
- I'm Michael!
- I don't know who the hell
you think you are...
- but you're not Michael Turner.
- Come on, you-you gotta believe me.
I'm Michael.
- You're not Michael.
- I'm Michael!
Come on!
- Who's shooting at us?
- Rival antique dealers!
Come on, come on!
Come on!
- Down here.
- I'm sorry I haven't been
totally honest with you.
- So you're not Michael!
- Well, we have the same DNA...
which makes us
kind of the same person!
Come on! In here!
- Come on. Come on. Get down.
- What is this?
- It's just a laundry chute.
- Come on, come on.
- It's a laundry chute?
- Ew! It smells in here.
- It's just dirty drawers. Shh.
- Be quiet. Be quiet.
- Shh. Shh.
- Are you trying
to play footsie with me?
- Shhh!
- Will you shut that off?
- With what? My ass?
- Reach in my pants.
- Hell, no!
You've reached in my brother's pants.
God--
- Hello?
- Mr. Turner?
Vas. You caught me
at a real bad time.
- What are you doing? Just hang up!
- Would you shut the hell up!
- No, you shut up!
- Shut up.
- Can I call you back?
- Don't bother.
- The Olsany Cemetery. Two hours.
- Shit!
There's people coming.
There's people coming.
Quiet. Quiet.
I knew I couldn't trust Michael. Always
so secretive, just downright sneaky.
Never even told me
that he had a brother.
Some investigative reporter
I am, huh?
This antique dealing stuff--
this is just a front, right?
You're drug dealers.
You're not even denying it.
I'm going back to the Balkans
where I'm safe.
- See, I told you I'd handle it.
- Very smooth.
Sir, those were
Dragan Adjanic's men. All dead.
Well, obviously
he thinks you're still alive.
Uh, by the way, Vas called.
We're on in two hours.
Olsany Cemetery. As we speak,
our field operatives are staking out
their perimeter positions.
They'll be with you all the way.
So will we.
Officer Welles has installed
a G-4 satellite tracking device
to your vehicle.
Unfortunately, that's all
we can manage safely. Vas will be
more worried about wiretaps...
than he will about weapons,
and you can expect him to check
both your car and you.
Seale is on his way
to the money transfer site at present.
Obviously we want you to connect
to the bomb in the computer...
and begin the verification process
as soon as possible.
Most importantly, once you're
connected to the bomb, a signal...
will be established via satellite
between your computer and Welles here...
who will try to steal the arming codes
while you check the bomb.
- So, if they don't have the codes,
they can't detonate the bomb.
- Right.
But you have to stall.
You may need to buy them some time.
Now, you'll hear three short tones
when the process is completed.
Once you've heard the tones,
you're satisfied the bomb is real...
Vas will give me the account number,
and I call Seale and authorize
the transfer of money.
And as soon as I get the word
from Seale, I'll provide confirmation
of the transfer of the $19 million...
from the Midlands National Bank
in Grand Cayman.
You're gonna give this guy $19 million?
I thought you was my man!
- Nineteen million?
- Actually, it's all digital dollars.
Ones and zeroes, man.
See, we issue a wire transfer.
The receiving bank seeks out
a GFX authorization sequence
verifying the funds are available.
It'll take his bank 48 hours
to realize that the money doesn't exist.
If the shit hits the fan,
you got that watch.
Oh, then I'll know what time it is
when the shit hits the fan.
Well, what's this?
Hey-hey, hey, hey!
- Somebody just walked out
with a sweater.
- That's a panic button.
You press that,
and the cavalry comes in.
There are a lot of people
counting on you, Mr. Hayes.
This is Olsany Cemetery. Almost
two million people are buried here.
- You think Vas
is trying to tell us something?
- Mm-hmm.
Yes? It's Vas.
Yes, he's with me.
- Graficka Road East.
- Graficka Road East, people.
- Is that one of ours?
- It's one of theirs.
Well, why does he have someone
following us if he's the one who's
telling us where we're going?
He's following us to make sure
no one else is following us.
- But someone is.
- Yeah, that's what makes it
so much fun.
They're headed for open country.
Make sure they don't get too close.
Dog One, this is Carolina.
Be advised, we're on a loose leash.
Roger that, Carolina.
Here's Mr. Smiley.
Get out of the car.
Your coats, please.
Thank you.
Mmm. You must be very trusting people
to come out here all alone, unarmed.
- What makes you think we're alone?
- Ah. Straight ahead.
- Parish McCain, come in.
- Okay, we're in position.
Sir, we're in place
outside Chotesov Monastery.
Ah, here they are.
And my good friend Michael.
Welcome to my church
where we worship money.
- Okay, let's get started.
- You wanted to look under the hood.
So look under the hood.
We're on line.
Let's go to work, people.
Casing unit. Apex mirror.
Detonating block.
This is insanity.
Just one electrical surge,
and you'll blow us all to hell.
Chill, Michelle.
I mean, relax. Relax, Michelle.
Downloading new authentication code.
- 117 seconds to completion.
- Now, as soon as I verify...
the uranium deflector
is of weapons grade...
we can all be on our merry way.
Uranium deflector?
This is plutonium reflector.
Plutonium.
That's what I meant. Plutonium.
Sixty seconds.
Michael, why is this taking
so long time?
I'm running one last
diagnostic test.
I mean, if you stayed
on top of things, you'd understand...
that the traditional checks
are not 100% foolproof.
This last test was designed by
the head of nuclear science at Cal Tech.
- A Dr Dre.
- Thirty seconds.
Dr. Dre, along with Dr. Erving
and Professor Griff...
and the rest of the Wu-Tang Clan,
know that it is best...
when you have
a baseline screen situation...
to achieve a post-opular
cataclysmic calibration...
or something we like to call
the Shaq Attack.
- Shaq Attack?
- Yes. Named after Dr. O'Neal...
of, uh, Los Angeles,
formerly of Orlando.
- All we need are the arming
and the disarming codes.
- I know, I know, but it's a mess.
I mean, I'm looking at it,
and I don't know what's what.
We're gonna have to dump it all
just to get the two codes, sir.
I hope we can stall long enough,
because there's, there's so much
information here.
What we're doing right now can help
not only in nuclear energy...
but also medicine, food--
I believe everything is in order.
Sorry, sir.
- But have the codes
been moved to Jake's computer?
- Yeah.
All right, let's get him, the bomb and
the computer back here on the double.
You got the bomb. Now where
is my remaining $19 million?
- Yes, sir.
- Show them the money.
Copy that.
Vas's account number received.
Initiating wire transfer
from Midlands National Bank of Bullshit.
Oh, man, is Vas gonna be pissed
when he goes to an ATM.
Fantastic. It's working.
I love it. American and Russians work
together again with Swiss bank accounts.
Gentlemen, I hope to see you
never again.
- Dragan Adjanic.
- You know any good prayers?
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face in my church.
- Wait. That's the guy
who killed my brother, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.
Michelle. What the hell
is he doing here?
Hey, Michelle, I told you
not to deal with him!
- What's happening?
Somebody do something.
- Very interesting.
Vas is being double-crossed
by his own men.
Come on, shoot him!
What time is it, Mr. Hayes?
Code red! Code red!
Everybody moves!
Kill him.
Here's the computer.
There's your bloody bomb.
- Where's my money?
- Triple-cross. Come on!
Having fun, Mr. Hayes?
Don't shoot the bomb, you fool!
- Don't shoot me either!
- Go! Go! Take the bomb!
I'm going, I'm going!
You drive! Go on!
Hey, wait for me!
- Come on. Faster.
- I'm going! I'm going!
It's a bloodbath, sir.
Vas and his men are dead.
Come on, man! You're James Bond!
Shoot the tyres out or something!
- Can't get close enough!
- Well, do something! Throw out
some tacks or something!
- Well, you got your wish.
- I wish for Jennifer Lopez naked.
We've looked everywhere.
They're just not here.
Look, I have satellite position on them.
I can assure you they're there.
Wait a minute. Hold on, sir.
They lost their tracking device.
- Whoa!
- What the hell are you doing?
- What, not smooth enough for your ass?
It's not my ass I'm worried about.
It's the bomb in the back seat.
- There's a bomb in the back seat!
- Yeah!
- Aaah! We're gonna die!
- Have a little faith, Mr. Hayes.
I'll have a little faith
if you give me a little gun!
Damn!
- Are you okay?
- Oh, here they come. Here they come.
- Pull back! Pull back!
- They're shooting at us!
They're shooting at us!
- Try! Shoot the gun!
- Come on! Back up! I don't have
any bullets! Come on, pull back!
- What do you mean,
you ain't got no bullets!
- Come on! Pull back!
I'm pulling!
Hit him!
Hit the son of a bitch!
Get off! Off! Take a bus!
No! Uh-oh!
Whoop his ass!
Yeah!
Get him!
Get him! Get him! Kill him!
Shoot him! Do something!
I got glass in my ass!
I want to go to Jersey!
I want to see my girl!
I want to watch Oprah!
Put your head in the car!
Put your head in the damn car!
He's whoopin' your ass!
No! No!
Take it! Ahh!
Back up!
- Come on, back up!
- Okay, okay, I'm backing up!
Get the bomb! Get the bomb!
- Faster!
- I can't--
No! No, no! Do something!
I want more money!
I hate you! I hate you!
I don't know about you,
but I'm hungry.
- Can someone give me some good news?
- Yeah.
He successfully downloaded
the arming codes into the computer.
- But they still have the computer.
- True, but he's put
his retinal signature in.
"Welcome, Michael Turner."
Try again.
So obviously they can't
access it without Jake.
- And when they figure that out?
- So what do we do now, sir?
We have to make sure that Jake's eyes
don't meet that computer screen.
- Right.
- Wrong.
- Wrong?
Sir, eventually someone will break
the lock and access the code
with or without Jake.
- So basically we, uh--
- We must find them before that happens.
Well, there is the obvious way
to flush them out.
- We dangle him?
- No. Give him a wire. They pick him up.
- He gives us a signal
when he sees the nuke.
- Look, if his eyes...
get anywhere near that computer,
we take everyone out, including him.
I need an executive finding
from the president immediately.
- So he's expendable. Is that it?
- You need to get the subject on board.
- You tell him whatever you want.
- Subject?
- Oakes, we both know
this is the only way.
- Yeah.
No! No! It ain't happening! No!
You want me to be your little,
little worm on a hook!
They never heard of Jake Hayes!
They don't even know I exist!
Just let me go back to Jersey,
get my girl and disappear!
Hey, man,
I'm sorry I'm not Kevin.
But even Kevin didn't
make it out of this alive.
- Will you let me show you something?
- No.
That's Jersey. So what?
Okay, let's look
at where you live, for example.
Where Julie lives. Your foster mother.
These people have
a nuclear bomb, Jake.
The blast alone will kill thousands.
Then comes the shock wave...
blowing away buildings,
tunnels, bridges...
and then comes
our old friend, radiation...
spread by wind and water,
infecting the living and the unborn.
And I think we, just you and me,
might have a chance to stop it.
That's all I'm saying. 'Cause
they've got us in check, Mr. Hayes...
and, uh, we can't let them
get checkmate, can we?
Look...
the way I see it,
you only got three moves.
Attack...
retreat or block.
You can't attack, 'cause
you don't know where they are.
Retreat... boom.
- Then we block.
- You could block.
But you only got one piece left...
and that's a pawn.
Sir, these gentlemen wish to see
Mr. Turner's phone records.
Mr. Turner's phone records
are sealed.
Mr. Turner made one phone call
to the United States.
To Jersey City, New Jersey.
- No, not today, man.
- Next week.
- All right.
- Hey! What? No!
- Aah! Oh, help! Help! Help!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
You-- What do you want?
Just take whatever you want!
Shh, shh, shh, shh. What is your
connection to Michael Turner?
I do-- I don't know
a Michael Turner. I don't-- Who?
- Him.
- Th-That's my boyfriend. That's Jake.
Tha-- Did he sell you bad tickets?
- You're still there, right?
- Yes, we're still here, Mr. Hayes.
- Y'all got guns, right?
- Yes, we have guns, Mr. Hayes.
Okay. Make sure
you got bullets in 'em.
Mm-hmm. Lots of bullets.
Answer the phone, Mr. Hayes.
- Michael Turner Antiques.
- Jake?
-Julie! How'd you find me?
- Michael Turner?
- Who-Who's this?
- Or should I call you Jake, Mr. Hayes?
You have one chance
of seeing this woman alive.
Take the next plane to New York.
Return to your apartment...
in New Jersey,
and wait till I call you.
If you're followed, she will die.
If you attempt to involve
any authorities, she will die.
Just let me talk to her!
Hello? Hello!
- Sorry.
- You used Julie!
- She was your pawn, right?
- No.
So all this bullshit about bein'
something bigger than you and me...
meant something bigger
than me and Julie, right?
- Will you let me explain?
-Just get me on the goddam plane.
Delta Zero Sierra.
Delta Zero Sierra.
This is Oscar Seven Tango.
Oscar Seven Tango. Over.
Let's go! Lock and load!
Set it up in that corner!
- Two-man team!
- This way, sir!
All right, let's get
all three sniper teams!
Hurry up on Tac-Four!
- Let's go, let's go!
- It's gotta come up now. Huh? Now!
- Notify all units.
- All right.
- Yeah.
I'm injecting a spread spectrum
transceiver behind your ear.
So we'll hear what you hear, and if they
take you to the bomb, we'll know it.
- Hold still, please.
- Aah! Aah!
- Come on, man! You can't put that
in a flower or something?
- It'd be too obvious.
Now, I'll be linked to you
the whole time. That's it.
Good luck, John. There's
something I ought to tell you.
I know. If the situation
gets out of hand, they could
take me and Julie out.
Don't worry, son. There'll be
extra money in this mission.
Hey, man, first of all,
I'm not your son.
Second of all, did it ever occur to you
that I might want to do something
'cause it's the right thing?
Hey, I'm the one with the dead brother!
I'm the one who misses his girl!
And I'm supposed to put up with your
shit 'cause you're a spy? Big deal!
Every woman on the planet's a spy! Man,
you guys can't even find Saddam Hussein!
You know, if you told a woman,
right now at 8:00 in the morning...
that her husband was sleeping
with Saddam Hussein...
she'd be able to find Saddam
by 8:00 that night and say...
"Saddam, don't you ever come
around my house no more!"
Hey, I did you a favour, okay?
You called me! Now, if you ever
talk down to me again...
I'm gonna beat your ass so bad,
you'll be the only guy in heaven
with a wheelchair!
You better act right
before you get smacked right, bitch!
All right, the show's over.
Go back to work.
A bomb on American soil. That's
a nightmare we've always talked about.
- How do you think they got it here?
- You'd be surprised what you can send
by air freight.
Did we? Did we use
his girlfriend, huh?
No, but I'm sure Yates would
if he thought of it.
- Hello?
- Listen closely.
No, no! You listen closely!
I gotta hear her voice!
I want to hear her voice right now!
You are in no position
to make demands, Mr. Hayes.
But if it gives you pleasure--
No! No! Don't hurt her!
Tell me what you want!
They want him to wait outside his
apartment for a car to pick him up.
We've initiated positions
here, here and here to set up a tail.
- How do they shake us?
- Well, we can assume that
they think we're shadowing him.
Right. So they may move him
ten or twenty times before
they think they've lost us.
Okay, we got the Grey Ford van.
Grey Ford van.
- I wish we didn't
have to do it this way.
- Well, I'm sorry if my plan...
lacks the perfect precision with which
you've handled the case so far.
Radiation detection units
are scouring the city...
and we've issued portable ABG
spectrometers to all surveillance teams!
We need to talk worst case scenario.
Evacuation readiness.
Let's have the National Guard
standing by.
National Guard,
this is Comm Centre Four.
- Stand by for instruction.
- Roger that, Comm Centre Four.
Standing by.
They're pulling into the abandoned
St. Francis Hospital, sir.
- Take positions.
- We have six viable entry points.
Move.
- Where's Julie?
- Quiet. Do as you're told.
- Where's Julie?
- I hope you're going to play...
- ball with us.
- That's Dragan.
- Hey, man, I ain't doin' shit
till I find Julie!
- Oh.
What the hell was that?
- We've lost the audio with Hayes, sir.
- All right, we move
to the contingency plan.
- Yes, sir.
- We can't afford
to take any chances here.
Hit your entry points hard
on my command.
If it breathes, it dies.
- Hold it! I think we've got something!
- Entry teams, pull back, pull back!
Entry teams, pull back!
Here he comes.
Come on. Get in.
Okay, they're moving him.
Everything's going according to plan.
Back on plan, people!
Keep your distance, folks.
They may do this dance all day long.
Get up!
Well, you're on your own now,
Mr. Hayes.
Sir, I'm getting
the signal back with Hayes!
- See if you can clean it up.
- Will do, sir.
I'm heading down
to Communication Central!
- Looks like they're
heading back to Jersey.
- Wonder what the hell they're doing.
Sir, wh-what are you doing?
Your eyes are going
to activate this computer.
The only question is...
will they still be in your head?
- Where's Julie?
- Oh, she's lovely.
And she will stay that way
if you cooperate.
Open your eyes, Mr. Hayes,
and look into the computer!
- Open your damn eyes, Mr. Hayes!
- No!
They're trying to scan his eyes.
Jesus Christ, the bomb is in the van!
Entry teams, the van is hot!
Move now!
Cut away his eyelids.
- Sir, they're gonna take out Jake.
What are we doing?
- It isn't Jake.
- How do you know?
- They had to have the decoy.
Bring the subject out with a bag
over his head. You do the math.
Faster! Go!
Hold your fire!
Subject is down.
Repeat, Jake Hayes is down.
It's not him.
The bomb's not here.
It's not him.
The bomb's not here.
It's done.
Thank you.
See you on the other side.
- Did you use the password?
- Password?
Hey, I don't speak terrorist...
but I only counted
eight number sequences.
And you're gonna need the seven-letter
password to activate the mechanism.
Bullshit.
No, see, that's,
that's eight letters.
There's no password.
The bomb is already armed.
- Hi.
- What took you so long?
- I almost killed somebody!
- Did they arm the bomb?
Yeah, this one just called in
enabling codes. I gotta find Julie.
- Okay, the bomb's hot.
- There's a fail-safe measure
built into the detonator.
- Should give us
a short countdown period.
- How short?
- On the outside, 20 minutes.
- What's the inside?
Five to ten.
- Did they say where the bomb was?
- No. She's not here.
When we find the bomb, we'll find her.
Did they say anything? Just think.
Try and remember. Come on. Think.
Redial! They called in the codes.
They called in the codes!
Okay, hold on.
Give me the address
to this number. 431-974--
Listen, I need this address.
Listen. Listen.
Give me this number.
Get me that address! Give me--
I need it now! Not later! Now!
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, it's coming, Oakes. It's coming.
- Yeah. Listen up, folks.
- 89 East 42nd Street!
- 89 East 42nd.
- Wait a minute.
- That's Grand Central Station!
- That's three blocks from here.
Come on!
Support can re-route
and be there in 20 minutes.
- Get out of the way!
- CIA! Coming through!
Out of the way! Move! Move!
Get out of the way! Get out--
Get out of the way!
- I'm hearing something.
- Get out of the way!
- Out of the way!
- I'm hearing it.
- Move it! Get out of the way!
- It's coming from over there!
- Move it! Move it!
- It's coming from over there!
Out of the way! Move it!
Move it! Out of the way!
- All right, the call
originated from over there.
- Could be anywhere.
-This is one hell of a place to blow up.
-Times Square is a few blocks away!
- Power grids, subway stations--
- The whole infrastructure
of the city could collapse.
- I'm getting something here.
- Wh-Wh-What's that?
This is a low-energy
gamma scintillation probe.
- Oh, yeah. I left mine's at home.
- The case is lined with lead.
We'd only get a hit
if we were within 100 square yards.
- So we got a hit, right?
- Yeah, well, the auto-range
indicates it's here.
- In here where? Here where?
- It's right here!
The signal is constant! It's--
It's under us! Come on!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Move it! Move, move, move!
- Please evacuate the building.
- CIA! Get out of the way! CIA! Move it!
- Proceed to the nearest exit.
- Signal's getting stronger!
- CIA. We need your help.
- This is an Emergency Service
announcement.
- Come on.
- Out of the way! Out of the way!
- Please evacuate the building.
Move, move, move!
Get out of the way!
- This way! This way!
Get out of the way!
- Come on! Out of the way!
- Come on! We're real close!
- What's in there?
- Lost luggage.
- Open it.
- This lock's been tampered with.
- Get away from the door!
Jake, get the bomb.
I'll cover you.
Why don't you get the bomb,
and I'll cover you?
Okay, I'll get the bomb!
Jake, go, go!
Oh, God!
Julie!
No, no. Hold on, hold on.
Jake?
-Jake, where are you?
- I'm coming!
It's in the final phase. Three minutes,
and it's goodbye to half of Manhattan.
-I need you here for the enabling codes.
-You said if we found the bomb,
we'd find Julie!
- I need you here now! Come on!
-Jake, I'll find her.
You're bleeding, man!
You-You're bleeding!
Now listen to me.
When they scanned your eyes...
you saw the codes;
try and remember them.
Whenever I hear numbers, my head
converts them into chess moves
or seats at the Garden.
- That's the only way I can remember.
- Take your time. Just relax.
- You know the codes.
You can do it. I know you can.
- Okay.
Queen's bishop three...
across from mezzanine section...
three oh four!
Okay. Let's see.
I saw a queen's bishop three...
aisle seat in section...
one forty-two.
- One forty-two.
- Two more to go.
Okay, I think I got it.
Did you find her?
Touch that bomb, she dies.
Keep going, Jake.
The bomb goes off, everybody dies.
- Two more numbers.
- They'll learn what death is.
Your country grows fat
while people all over the world starve.
You stay at home, you watch
our blood spilled on television.
- War reduced to video games.
- He's stalling, Jake.
Enter the codes now!
You take sides in conflicts
you know nothing about...
dictating to other people
how they should live.
You're so keen on playing God.
Well, now is your chance
to meet him.
- I'll give you three seconds,
then I'll kill her.
- Go ahead.
One...
two--
No! I'll kill you!
Three!
- Move, move, move!
-Jake, what--
- Honey, honey, honey, honey.
I-I love you. Let me do this.
Rook six four three.
Okay, okay.
One more! One more!
Get out of the way! Get out
of the way! Move! Move! Move!
- Well, that's done.
- That's it?
That's all it does?
Beep, beep, beep?
That's all we wanted it to do.
- Don't worry, baby.
-Jake.
- It's okay.
- Clear, sir. Go ahead. Go, go!
- Officer Seale is down.
We need a medic.
- Get him to a hospital.
- It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.
- Who is that? Who is that?
- Where is the bomb?
- Right here.
- How much time do we have?
- I got you. I got you.
- Mr. Hayes defused the bomb.
- Check the back!
- Don't worry. I got you.
- Oakes has been hit.
- Roger that.
- Emergency services standing by.
- You're safe with me. I love you, baby.
- I missed you.
- You all right?
- I missed you too.
- People, we did it.
Which star is your brother's?
There are no names, Ma.
Agent identities are never revealed...
even after they die,
but they're all honoured right here.
Their names are written in this book,
their families sign it...
and then the pages
are sealed forever.
It's a book of forgotten heroes.
- Nah, Th-they're not forgotten.
-Jake?
- Hey.
- Thanks for keeping me off that wall.
- Well, stay off it.
- Okay.
Ma, this is from me and Julie.
I just hope it brings
a little joy in your life.
Aw, I knew you'd make me proud.
Oh, this is just such--
Oh, Good Lord!
Ninety thousand dollars?
N-No, it's-- That's the wrong one, Ma.
Here, this is yours.
This is for when we get married.
Oh, ten thousand's
much more than I need.
- Then give some back.
- Ohh.
Hey, honey, can you
walk Ma to the car?
- I gotta talk to Oakes.
- Yeah.
- Congratulations on your engagement.
- So I'll see you at the wedding, right?
Goodbye, Mr. Hayes.
Oh, I see.
No personal attachments.
You lucky one. Yes. Right here.
Hey, what's up?
What's up, man?
- Congratulations, Mr. Hayes.
- Oakes.
You didn't RSVP. I figured
weddings weren't your thing.
- I'm on a new assignment.
- Well, if you're supposed to be
undercover at a black wedding...
I think you're
the wrong guy for the job.
An old friend of Kevin's
escaped from Riker's Island.
I don't care if he escaped
from Temptation Island.
I'm not goin' nowhere.
I just got married.
Can't a brother get a piece of cake?
The guy who escapes is Carlos Palmeros,
the world's foremost assassin.
Carl-- I don't care if it's Carlos
Santana, the world's foremost guitarist!
The world's foremost assassin?
That's like the Tiger Woods of murder!
Well, Kevin was responsible
for putting him away.
The problem is, he thinks you're Kevin,
so he's coming after you to kill you.
Oh! No. No.
Th-Th-That's not happening.
That's not happening. That's right.
I just got married.
I'm gonna go off with my wife.
I'm gonna be happy for two years...
and I'm gonna be miserable for 90,
just like everybody else!
I got you. I got ya!
- So there's no killer?
- No. Not yet.
So you just came here
for my wedding?
I wouldn't have missed it.
Not for the world.
- Oh, I get it.
So you and Swanson are next.
- Me? No.
-I'm never gonna get married. Not again.
-If you're never
gonna get married again...
the first thing you gotta learn is,
don't take your girlfriend to a wedding.
We may need to call on you
in the future.
It's your wedding present
from us at the agency.
Two tickets to Hawaii.
- I-I can't take this, Oakes.
-Jake? Sweetie? Come on.
- Your wife is calling you, Mr. Hayes.
- Husband.
Get in the car, bitch.
Hey, Oakes! Never say never.
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
believing for so long
- So long
- I'm all out of love
- Out of love, yeah
- What am I without you
- So lost without you, no

- Was so wrong

Six million ways to live
We live lavish
Superior deluxe, rap status
To carry that mattress with no bounce
A sharp cactus, blanket
Leavin'scratches across the atlas
Buildin' above civilians
Takes two looks to recognize the villain
Two blinks to make your heart sink
Three-sixty degrees like a roller rink
That's how my life moves
upon a solar ring
Try so hard my soul to sing, but still
my pen moves on to bolder things
Can't hang like a soldier around you
He who can't compete against
a flowing thing
Blood is the life through the mainframe
Keepin' on top of stray slayings
How you livin', power driven
to the Maximus, passionate
Innocent to where the action is
A small fraction of the population
Holding down his occupation
It's wrong concentration
A simple conversation
I'll listen to the rhythm
Sometimes we don't agree
But not afraid to talk about it openly
I took it overseas
to lock it down totally
Package it like groceries
You take it to the apex
Even straight brothers golden
to my peeps across the ocean
Brother you sober or stay smokin'
Down-Down to earth or stay floatin'
Flood gates about to break open
Six million ways to live
Six-Six-Six million ways to live life
Boy, there's six million
ways to live life
Whole lot to give, yo
So we grab mice
'Cause there's six million
ways to live lavish
Beyond all the misery
and mathematics
- Oh, there's six million ways to live
- Six million
- Six million ways to live
- Six million
'Cause there's six million
ways to live lavish
Beyond all the misery
and mathematics
'Cause there's six million
ways to live
Six million ways to live
