Baby-sitters Club.
This is Mrs. Rodowsky.
Hi. We´re going out for dinner on Tuesday
with the whole family.
l was wondering, would any of you mind
baby-sitting the dog?
l mean, he just hates to be left alone.
Baby-sitters Club.
l´m on a car phone. l need a sitter
for tonight. lt´s an emergency.
Hi, this is Mrs. Wilder.
l´m having a birthday party for Rosie...
and do any of you dress up as clowns?
Hi, l need a sitter tonight.
My sister was gonna watch the kids,
but she flaked out.
lt´s me again. My wife´s going
into the hospital any minute.
We´re pregnant. No, l mean, she´s pregnant.
Anyway, we´ve got a toddler at home and....
Baby-sitters Club.
We´re gonna need a baby-sitter
Saturday night.
We need a baby-sitter on Friday night.
l know it´s only August,
but could l book for New Year´s Eve?
Yeah. lt´s me again. Listen.
ls anyone, like, immediately....
My name is Kristy. l´m the founding member
of the Baby-sitters Club.
My name is Kristy. l´m the founding member
of the Baby-sitters Club.
l don´t mean to brag,
but we´re famous here in Stoneybrook.
Hey, Kristy!
Everybody knows us.
That´s because everybody uses us.
You call one number...
and get connected
to seven incredible baby-sitters.
This is Stacey. She´s our club treasurer.
She´s good at keeping track of money.
She´s also good at spending it.
Stace was raised in New York City.
Sometimes she thinks she still lives there.
358 Bradford Court.
That´s Mary Anne.
When we were little,
we used to live next door to each other.
She´s kind of quiet, kind of serious.
Why are we friends?
They say opposites attract.
Dawn is Mary Anne´s stepsister.
She grew up in California.
Dawn really cares about the environment.
Her biggest regret is that
she wasn´t born on Earth Day.
Claudia´s an amazing artist.
She´s really talented.
Do you know anybody who could take a fork
and a hammer and turn it into that?
And, of course, Mallory.
She´s a junior member of the club.
She wants to be a writer.
She started her novel when she turned 11...
and is determined to finish it
by the time she´s eleven-and-a-half.
Jessi is Mallory´s best friend.
She´s 11, too, and our other junior member.
Jessi´s motto is.:
´´Why walk when you can dance?´´
You know, we´re more than just a club.
We´re friends. Best friends.
Nothing could ever change that.
Dawn, l heard that Alan Gray likes you.
Likes her, or ´´like´´ likes her?
That dweeb? Spare me.
lt doesn´t matter anyway...
because l don´t like him or ´´like´´ like him.
Something´s wrong here, you guys.
School´s out, and l miss it.
l know. lt´s not that l love it. lt´s just....
-We don´t see each other every day?
-We end up baby-sitting at different houses.
-We might as well be on separate planets.
-Yeah.
The first Baby-sitters Club meeting
of the summer is now called to order.
We have our meetings in Claudia´s room.
lt´s the best part of the week.
We started there
because she´s the only one with a phone...
but now it´s home.
-Soy-meal chips? Forget it.
-They´re good for sugar addiction.
l know l´m late,
but there was this really big--
Sale!
What´d you get this time?
-You´re too much.
-Baby-sitters Club.
Hi, Mrs. Rodowsky.
Wednesday night, 6:00 to 9:30. Sure.
-Got it. Hold on. Who´s free Wednesday?
-Not me.
According to the schedule...
you and me, but count me out.
Last time it took me two hours
to get that dog clean.
Okay, Mrs. Rodowsky, you´re all set.
l´ll be there at 6:00 sharp. Okay, bye.
l know Jackie Rodowsky´s
a walking disaster, but l like him, okay?
-New business.
-We have a tragedy here.
l flunked science
and l have to go to summer school.
-Are your parents gonna kill you?
-Maybe.
Don´t sweat it, Claud.
l got straight A´s in science this year.
-l´ll coach you.
-Claud, you´re an artist.
-You don´t have to be a scientist.
-She´s right.
Tell that to my mom. lf l don´t get a C plus,
l have to drop out of the club.
-Don´t worry. We´ll help you.
-You´ll pass. Promise.
What if l don´t?
Baby-sitters Club.
Okay, l´ll tell her.
Stace, that was Ms. Wilder. She says that
her little nephew´s coming in tonight.
-He´s from Switzerland.
-Great. l love little kids with accents.
Hello!
-Hi, Stacey.
-Hi, Rosie. You´re getting so good.
Thank you.
l have a treat for you in the Kid Kit:
extra stickers and puzzles.
Great.
And l brought something
for your little cousin. Where is he?
Hi, l´m Luca...
the little cousin.
You brought me a gift?
lt´s just a small, little...
American flag thing.
Cool. Very nationalistic.
And you´re....
Stacey. Your sitter, l guess.
l thought you were going to the movies.
l have my whole life to go to the movies.
Have you seen Karen and Andrew?
Weren´t they
with David Michael and Emily Michelle?
-This house is too big.
-Can l have my own phone?
-Andrew!
-No.
-But l need it for business.
-When you´re 16.
-Kristy, have you seen Karen and Andrew?
-But this doesn´t make any sense.
lt doesn´t have to.
You won´t let me have BSC meetings here.
At least give me a phone.
We live too far away to have them here,
and l don´t want you to have a phone.
They´re not upstairs or in the garage.
-You can´t just say no.
-Karen!
A good parent would give their child
a logical reason.
-l don´t want you to be spoiled.
-l´m already spoiled.
They have to be somewhere.
Where? They´re not upstairs.
They´re not under the beds.
l looked under the beds. l looked under--
l know.
They´re with Colonel Mustard in the library
with the wrench.
l´m Pirate Esmeralda, and this is my slave.
What would you guys do without me?
Thanks for helping me baby-sit.
Here´s half of what l made tonight.
No, keep your money.
You know,
l baby-sit Rosie every Wednesday.
From 7:30 to 9:30.
What about every other night of your life?
-Do you like the movies?
-Mary Poppins is her favorite.
We´ve seen that video 100,000 times.
Well, l baby-sit her a lot.
Why don´t you go out with me Saturday?
We could go to the movies.
lf nothing is playing,
you could show me around Stoneybrook.
This is kinda it.
lt´s not like New York City or anything.
That´s where l grew up.
Have you ever been there?
-No, not yet.
-lt´s the best.
You mean, like you?
Are you gonna kiss her?
Whatever gave you that idea, Rosalind?
Come on, let´s go.
-Don´t let them burn.
-Do you think l should have told him?
-What? Who?
-Luca.
He doesn´t know l have diabetes.
lt´s not like you have the flu or something.
He can´t catch it.
Yeah, l mean, if he´s any kind of guy,
he won´t care.
l don´t want him to know.
He´ll think l´m pathetic.
We all know. We don´t think you´re pathetic.
A little psycho maybe.
He also doesn´t know l´m only 13.
-So?
-He´s 1 7.
-That´s ancient.
-He´s a poet.
-He drives.
-He´s a musical genius.
-He´s been to Europe.
-He´s from Europe.
-Cough it up.
-Here´s mine.
-Count me in.
-l forgot mine.
Stace, treasurer´s report.
After dues, we´ll have $58.
But after the phone bill
and Kid Kit supplies...
we´ll have $1 1 .47.
-That´s all?
-We´re loaded.
Okay, new business.
l have a brilliant idea.
Stoneybrook Summer Camp for Seniors?
No! A day camp for our clients.
lt´ll give us a new service to offer.
lt´ll be a total gold mine...
and most important, it´s a way for us
to stay together the whole summer.
ls this not the most brilliant idea yet?
Last time she was like this,
she wanted us to open a dude ranch.
No, seriously, you guys.
lt´ll be so easy, and the kids´ll love it.
We can go from 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday or something.
We can start after the Fourth of July,
give us time to set up.
l don´t know what we´ll charge,
but we can figure that out.
l´ve put together some start-up budgets
and schedules to check out.
Here, you guys.
-lt looks good, Kristy.
-You guys share.
Kristy, this brilliant idea
might really be brilliant.
My dad said we could use the yard,
but there are a few rules.
The first, in bold print and underlined:
-´´The house is off-limits to children.´´
-´´At all times.´´
-How many pages are there?
-Don´t ask.
Just our luck
your dad´s a lawyer, Mary Anne.
Okay, let´s start marking it off.
-Let´s put the sports area....
-Let´s put it over there.
-The dance area over there.
-First-aid tent back there.
-What about arts and crafts?
-We can line up Porta-Potties by the fence.
Perfect. We´ll put the garbage cans
next to them.
-Will the neighbors be a problem?
-They´re cool.
-What about the new one?
-What about her?
You guys, my dad needs us
to sign this contract...
and initial all the pages he´s marked.
-Put your John Hancock right there.
-This will be great.
Shouldn´t we read this before we sign it?
Jackie Rodowsky´s one of my best clients
and the first camper to sign up.
His dream is to hit a home run.
Problem is, he can´t even hit a ball.
Too bad he doesn´t want to be a jockey,
because he can stay on a horse.
Cokie Mason´s hated us
since the third grade.
Everyone´s forgotten why.
Her number-one mission in life
is to put the BSC out of business.
Your helmet´s on backwards.
Hurts my ears the other way.
That´s Logan Bruno, Mary Anne´s boyfriend.
He´s an associate member of the BSC.
Mary Anne´s been in love with Logan
since he moved here from Kentucky.
Unfortunately, so has Cokie Mason.
Look at Kristy
and her band of goody two-shoes.
What do they think they are?
One big, happy family?
-Kristy, this horse won´t let me down.
-Hey, you all. How´s the ride?
l´ll grab Logan´s arm
and you go distract Mary Anne, okay?
What if she doesn´t leave him alone?
Mary Anne and Logan
never let each other out of their sight.
What are they afraid of? Moi?
Logan, l´m so glad you´re here.
-l wanted to call you.
-Oh, yeah?
-Get lost, Cokie.
-Hello, Kristin.
You have a date...
and l can see his age is the same as your lQ.
Who let you out
of that bat cave, Marguerite?
She hates to be called that.
That´s your real name?
No. lt´s the mumbling of an idiot.
Stall her.
Go do what l said.
l have to talk to you.
Mary Anne?
-Hi.
-Hi.
Wait!
What classes are you taking next year?
l don´t really know yet. Why?
Can l try on your riding pants?
-Fifth row? Center? How´d you get them?
-Logan?
l knew you´d say yes. Just think.
You, me, and Smashing Pumpkins.
-What are you doing?
-Cokie, l....
-Cokie?
-What?
-Don´t you have somewhere else to be?
-Don´t waste my time.
Logan, call me tomorrow.
Logan, l don´t believe you.
Come on, let´s go.
She´s eating seeds again.
lsn´t it great how every time we come here
the burgers taste the same?
l like that. Something you can count on.
Dawn, have you watered yourself lately?
What?
Kristy, you got a birthday coming up.
What should we do?
l don´t know. Just as long as
it´s the best day of my life. But no pressure.
Guys, $250 per camper.
lf 30 campers sign up, that´s $7,500.
We´re rich.
-We can almost buy a car.
-ln five years, we can drive it.
lf we get enough money,
we can open our own office.
-That´s a great idea.
-We could get a fax machine.
-Go international.
-That´ll sure let me off the hook if l flunk.
-You´re not gonna flunk.
-Claud, l´ll help you.
Okay.
l say we start looking.
How many people have we signed up?
On our last count, we had...
twelve.
We passed out a million fliers.
-My brother David Michael will come.
-How´s your little day camp going?
-Great. Couldn´t be better.
-Really?
l happened to find a few of these...
flying around Main Street.
Mary Anne...
l got the most outrageous outfit
for the concert.
l´m not going to cry.
l´ll be right back.
Listen, you guys, we´ve been fighting
each other since the third grade...
and now that we´re getting older,
don´t you think it´s time we stop?
We´re having our annual BSC party...
-tomorrow night at Miller´s Park at 8:00.
-What party?
lf you could come,
it would be great, 8:00 sharp.
Right, l´m sure.
-What?
-l don´t know.
-We don´t have anything to do tomorrow.
-Of course we do.
lt´s Friday night.
We´ll be hanging out at Pizza Express.
l think we should go.
Besides, they´re kind of cool.
They´re not cool.
We´re cool, and don´t you ever forget that.
-What´s up?
-You´ll find out.
Let´s see how cheese-ball
this baby-sitters´ party is gonna be.
-They´re such girl scouts.
-Why are we here then?
Logan Bruno will be here.
What does he see in Mary Anne, anyway?
She´s pretty, she´s nice,
and she´s really sweet.
So?
Where is everybody?
Welcome to the official opening
of the first day...
Welcome to the official opening
of the first day...
of the Baby-sitters Club Summer Day Camp.
Getting even with Cokie was easy.
Then we had to get the camp off the ground.
Every day had a plan,
every plan had a backup...
and every backup had a fallback.
Lots of our regulars signed up,
and some new kids, too.
Boy, were they enthusiastic.
And us, we were ready for anything.
At least, that´s what we thought.
0n behalf of every one of our baby-sitters,
we have a souvenir for you...
which also serves a very important purpose.:
lt connects you with your counselor
and is very handy in the kitchen.
Don´t hesitate to use this
with your friends, family, and favorite foods.
Please note the color of your potholder.
Go directly to the counselor
wearing the same color potholder as you.
Thank you.
The preparation phase was a nightmare...
but we had to stick it out
´cause we were gonna make a fortune.
Can l have one for Jimmy-Tony?
How old is Jimmy-Tony?
Jimmy-Tony, they want to know
how old you are.
He´s the same age as me.
Well, then he gets a red one, too.
Come on.
-Okay, he´s paid.
-Kristy, look.
Green. Same as you.
-What do we got?
-Can l have one?
What?
She said she wants a potholder.
See you.
My mom was wondering,
well, there´s two of us...
and l was wondering, too.
My mom and dad talked, and they
don´t think me and my sister should come...
because it´ll be too much money,
so l was wondering:
Since my sister´s so small,
could we both get in for the price of one?
l´ve been to the moon.
Over there!
On your mark! Get set! Go!
Come on, you guys! Come on!
Come on, guys! Go!
-l´ve got to go to the bathroom!
-Me, too!
Bathroom?
Got to go to the bathroom?
Okay, hold on. Give me one second.
Stacey, where are the Porta-Potties?
The guy said they were coming
at 8:00 this morning.
l´ve got to go now!
-Get me out of here!
-We have to use your house.
No way. My mom will kill us.
They have to go to the bathroom!
Suzi, what are you doing in there?
Shaving.
Oh, no. The neb.
-Alan Gray.
-Hide me.
Get back. Back.
-Okay, turn. Good.
-You sure you don´t need any help?
-l think you all should think about it.
-´Cause this is my last offer.
Sounds like your first offer.
l´d snap him up if l was you all,
´cause he´s really great with the kids.
-How much would you want?
-Not much.
Like how much?
Like nothing.
-When can you start?
-Yesterday.
-You got a deal.
-Kristy!
-He´s a dweeb.
-He´s a free dweeb.
Yeah, l´m a free dweeb.
l said get her a flower,
not squirt her with one.
Right.
Sorry.
Logan said he wouldn´t have gone
with Cokie.
But what if he did?
What would you have done?
-Nothing.
-You couldn´t do nothing!
lf he wants to do something,
l can´t stop him.
Yes, you can. You can tell somebody
when you´re ticked off.
We can´t let men get away with everything.
Kristy, hi.
-How you doing?
-Dad?
You grew a beard.
-A while ago. You must be Kristy´s friend.
-Mary Anne.
Sure, you´re Richard Spier´s little girl.
l´d better go.
lt was nice seeing you again, Mr. Thomas.
Patrick.
-Call me, or l´ll call you.
-Call me.
Sorry, l didn´t mean to surprise you
like this.
What are you doing here?
Didn´t you get my postcard?
l said l´d be coming.
Dad, you always say you´ll be coming.
You look great.
l mean, what, it´s been....
l mean, you were....
So how was school this year?
-Okay.
-Did you like it?
-Yeah.
-Did you get good grades?
Guess so.
So you hungry? Wanna go get a pizza?
Why are you here?
Look, l know it´s weird just showing up...
but there´s...
really no other way l could figure to do it.
Do what?
-l´m moving back.
-You are?
Yeah, l have a shot at a sports column
with The News.
l didn´t want to say anything
till it was a sure thing, but l....
You know, l couldn´t resist seeing you.
Have you seen Mom?
Not yet.
She´s probably in the house.
l don´t want her to really know l´m here yet.
Not till l hear about the job, okay?
Think we could keep it a secret
for a couple of days?
l guess.
Good.
l like your hair long. lt looks really cool.
l´ll be staying at the Strathmore lnn
if you want to reach me.
And don´t forget, l owe you a pizza.
Still like anchovies best?
Yeah?
Okay.
0ne, two, three, four, five!
Howdy, partners!
Just remember, it´s Cowboy Day!
l mean ´´Cowgirl´´!
lt´s Cowpeople Day!
Sit tall on your saddles.
Walk like you mean it.
And remember, one person
in the Porta-Potty at a time.
-Dawn?
-Thank you, Kristy.
The Earth can do anything
if you treat it right.
Howdy, Dawn!
Alan!
What did you do that for?
Alan, why do you act like such a bonehead?
No good reason.
Look alive over here!
Let´s hear some chatter!
Why? He´s not gonna hit it.
Yeah! No way is he gonna hit that ball!
You got to strike out a couple times
before you hit a home run.
He´s never gonna hit the ball!
This is it. l can feel it.
l can see it in your elbow.
He stinks! He´s the worst!
He´s not gonna hit it!
Mary here is on a time out
for sticking gum in Charlotte´s hair.
Margie.
-Margie, how old are you?
-Four-and-a-half.
-You´re on a four-and-a-half minute time out.
-No, l´m two.
-What do you think?
-l don´t really belong here.
Please, you´ve got to come with me.
Kristy, it isn´t like you´re six or something.
l mean, you´re almost 13.
lt´s not like you need a chaperone.
l don´t wanna go alone.
Kristy, you´re gonna love this.
You too, Mary Anne, l hope.
That´s okay. l don´t have to eat.
l could even leave.
No. She´ll eat anything.
Good, because my hotel
didn´t have a kitchen...
and l wanted to make you
something really special.
-So guess what it is.
-l don´t know.
You don´t know?
Mouse pancakes.
Yeah, mouse pancakes.
Wow, Dad. l mean Patrick.
What´s in this?
-Pancake mix.
-You´re a little rusty.
When Kristy was little...
the only way l could get her to eat
was to make her mouse pancakes.
So we did every Sunday morning.
Right, pal?
So when are you gonna call Mom?
Soon. l´ve been really busy.
Dad, a phone call
doesn´t take that much time.
l´m gonna go to the bathroom.
Where is it?
Rest rooms. See that maple down there?
You take a left at the maple.
Don´t worry, they´re clean.
Your mom thinks l´m a loser.
All right? So before l walk
into that mansion you live in...
l gotta have a job, l gotta have a home...
and a few things put together,
you know what l mean?
Plus Chris Almond at the paper says
a couple days, a week tops.
Think you can give me that?
l guess so.
Good.
l got you something.
Thanks!
-What? You don´t like it? l can take it back.
-No, don´t do that.
lt´s really nice...
for a dress.
Do you really like the dress?
Yeah. lt´s great.
Forgot why l got up.
-Kristy, you have to tell your mom.
-l can´t. l promised.
And you cannot tell anyone.
But l tell Dawn everything,
and l tell Logan even more.
You can´t, Mary Anne. Not this time. Swear.
All right.
-But who cares if he has a job yet or not?
-Him, l guess.
Can you believe he gave me a dress?
What was l supposed to say?
´´Sorry, l only wear dresses
at weddings and funerals´´?
-He´d think l was crazy.
-You are.
l win.
Your mom looks just like Jo
in Little Women.
-You think so?
-Yeah. You look like him.
-l do?
-A little.
-What if l talk about him in my sleep?
-l´m sleeping over, remember?
lf you talk, l´ll stuff a pillow in your face.
You okay?
Kind of freaked out.
Welcome to Punch and Judy Day!
Look, Mary Anne. l didn´t say yes.
-But you didn´t say no.
-But l didn´t say yes.
l wasn´t gonna go with Cokie.
Cross your heart and hope to die?
Welcome to Sports Day.
Remember, only do sports
in your sports group.
Okay, you know
what you´re supposed to do.
l´ll distract him.
Logan, l like your jeans. Nice fit.
Hi, Cokie.
Cokie, how are you?
Your skin looks a little dry.
You´re trying to insult me. How hilarious.
Nice muscle.
Loved your little party in Miller´s Park.
-We did it.
-Great! Did you pull the tab?
We didn´t pull anything.
You were supposed to pull, you freak!
Look what we got!
Cool!
You brats!
-Jackie, l gotta go, okay?
-What do you mean? We gotta practice.
-Sorry, Jackie. How about tomorrow?
-l guess.
-Mallory.
-Yeah?
-Mallory, cover for me, okay? l gotta go.
-Why?
l gotta leave early. So see you.
l won´t miss the next one, Jackie.
Okay? Promise.
l don´t believe this.
-What in the--
-Who´s that man?
This is too weird.
Kristy has a boyfriend?
-The world must be flat.
-Who´s the guy?
-No one.
-No one?
Who is he, Mary Anne?
l can´t tell you. l promised.
Since when did we start
keeping secrets, Mary Anne?
Hello?
l´m Emily Haberman.
l´m your neighbor. l live next door.
Hi, Mrs. Haberman.
Sometimes l see you in your garden.
A little while ago, l was nearly asphyxiated...
by a smelly, stinking, disgusting projectile...
and l, frankly, have had enough!
-lt wasn´t us.
-We didn´t know.
Would you happen to know...
what little buzzy insects and small children
have in common?
They both have the ability
to drive a human being...
who is both larger and smarter...
completely out of her mind.
Now, you look like decent, sensible girls...
so let´s just call this a warning, shall we?
-But if there´s any more trouble--
-There won´t be.
You make sure there isn´t,
because if there is...
l shall be forced to call the city...
and speak to them
about revoking your permit.
-Permit?
-Yes. Permit.
-She´s a hermit?
-lsn´t that some kind of animal?
Permit, you idiots!
Claudia, are you studying?
l was so caught up with my dad,
l wasn´t being much of a club president...
and Claud was going through it, too.
Besides camp, she had summer school
and l hated to admit it...
but she was doing
some of my camp work, too.
But somehow, and l don´t know how...
she managed to come up
with a really great plan for the BSC.
l think l´m having my first brilliant idea.
So what do you think?
lsn´t this a cool place?
lt was built in 1 767.
Then later, in the 1800s,
someone turned it into a greenhouse.
Did we even have a country back then?
No, but we had a lot of diphtheria.
l´m writing a novel
about the first nurse in America.
Okay.
Let´s go in, you guys.
We checked into it.
This place used to be an old gatehouse
before someone turned it into a greenhouse.
lt´s owned by the town,
but the civic committee said if we fix it...
and they approve it, we can use it.
-lt´s awfully dirty.
-lt´s really cool.
-l don´t know. lt seems like a lot of work.
-lt´s really hot in here.
We´ve got the nebs for the grunt work.
We can put the meeting table over there,
and the phone banks over there.
Don´t you think this would make
an absolutely amazing office?
Yeah, l do. That´s why l suggested it.
No! Put that down!
Anyone caught throwing food
will be sent to the time-out booth.
Mallory, have you seen Dawn around?
Yeah, she´s around.
l repeat.: Anyone caught throwing food...
will definitely be sent to the time-out booth.
l didn´t do anything.
All right! That´s it!
Everyone to the time-out booth!
Cut it out! That´s it!
Come on! That´s enough!
-l´m wiped.
-Dead.
-Stace, how was your date with Luca?
-Smashing.
Smashing? Did he hit you over the head
with his charm?
My parents said we could use
my aunt´s cabin for Kristy´s birthday party.
-Great.
-That´s perfect.
Kristy, Watson told my stepdad he had some
info on the greenhouse. Did you bring it?
-No, l forgot.
-Kristy, that was important.
lt was all kinds of rules and stuff
we need to get it fixed up so we can use it.
-How could you forget?
-That´s not like you, Kristy.
-l have nothing to wear.
-What about what you´re wearing?
-l hate what l´m wearing.
-You have too much to wear.
-l hate the way l look.
-You look great.
-Should l change my socks?
-You have to calm down.
-Why is he here?
-Stacey, listen to you.
-l know.
-Did you eat?
l will before l go.
lf you eat on schedule and give yourself
your insulin shots on time...
your diabetes will not be a problem.
-lf you don´t--
-l know, Mom.
-l´m a little nervous about Luca, that´s all.
-Yeah. So am l.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Come on in.
-You look smashing.
-Thanks.
So do you.
-l thought we´d go for a hike.
-A hike?
You do hike?
Hike? Sure, l do it all the time.
Let me just tell my mom.
-Tell me what?
-Mom, we´re going on a hike, okay? Bye.
A hike? You? ln that?
You must be Luca.
l´m Stacey´s mother, Maureen.
Pleasure to meet you.
-Okay, later, Mom.
-Wait. Did you eat something?
-l grabbed a muffin.
-When did you grab a muffin?
-l put it in my bag. l´ll eat in the car.
-Are you sure, Stace?
Yeah, bye.
-Tschûss!
-Tschûss, Mom.
Wait. What does tschûss mean?
l don´t know.
lf we keep going, we´ll find it.
Find what?
Heaven.
-You doing all right?
-What?
-Great.
-Good.
The band´s called The Dogs.
We´re pretty good, if l do say so myself.
l´d love to see you play.
Have you ever performed here?
Of course not. You´ve never been here.
Stoneybrook will be our first stop.
Come on.
l heard there´s a fantastic view at the top.
Stacey!
Luca, l need something to eat.
Okay.
Sorry, Claud. Can we do it tomorrow?
You promised to help me study, Kristy.
What´s up with you?
Sorry, Claud. l´m doing the best l can.
What´s so important?
lt´s David Michael´s birthday today...
and l have to be with my family.
l´ll make it up to you, Claudia. l promise.
Kristy, l´m going to the nursery
to pick up the rosebush. Come with me.
l have to go to Claudia´s and help her study.
Well, that´s on the way. l´ll drop you.
l was....
l don´t have to be there yet,
so l was gonna make myself a sandwich.
l´ll put Emily with Nannie and l´ll join you.
l was just gonna take it with me.
So l´ll see you later?
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetie. Love you.
Love you, too. Bye, sis.
l didn´t eat. That´s why l fainted.
Sorry. lt´s just when my blood sugar
gets low l get kind of psycho.
l wish you had told me you were diabetic.
lt´s no big deal.
Maybe not for you...
but it makes people treat me
like l´m a little kid.
My mother is so overprotective.
lt makes me crazy
to worry about her worrying about me.
lt´s okay. l´m just glad you feel better.
l didn´t want you to think
l was sick or something, or weird.
l don´t think you´re weird.
l think you´re beautiful.
Mom and l are so close, l hated lying to her.
But l knew if l left the house in a dress,
she´d know something was up.
Still, l wanted Dad to see me
in the dress he bought me...
and the greenhouse
seemed the perfect place to change.
lt´s 1978, Yankees versus Red Sox.
-One game playoff.
-Goose Gossage pitching.
Carl Yastrzemski batting.
lt´s a stare-down
between Yastrzemski and Gossage.
l didn´t remember
my dad being this much fun...
and l wanted to see him as much as l could.
We had a lot of lost time to make up for.
-The Yaz hits it out of the park!
-Man! Wait a minute!
-You can´t obstruct the base runner!
-ls that right? l forgot.
-The Yaz hits it out of the park!
-That´s not the way it happened!
-lt is this time!
-ls that right?
-The Yaz hits it out of the park!
-No way.
You look so grown up.
l feel like a pencil.
You don´t look like one.
Peanut butter and banana!
My favorite.
l love it.
You said you were gonna be hearing
about your job in a couple days.
-lt´s been a few weeks. When will you know?
-Soon. Real soon.
Personally, l like grapes with my meal.
-You´re so silly.
-Thank you.
-Dad.
-What?
l´m glad you´re back.
Me, too.
l can´t believe this.
Kristy´s never missed a meeting.
-She did once.
-Her dog died.
We´ve been waiting half an hour.
l know l´m the alternate,
but my potassium´s down.
Okay, l´ll do it.
This meeting of the Baby-sitters Club
is now called to order.
-Hi, guys. Sorry l´m late.
-Kristy, you´re wearing a dress.
-Who died?
-Should we start?
-We already have.
-New business. The Mrs. Haberman problem.
Who´s Mrs. Haberman?
Our neighbor who´ll report us to the city
and take away our permit for the camp.
We don´t need a permit. l checked it out.
lt would´ve been nice
if you were there to tell her that.
-l had an appointment.
-Since when is a date an appointment?
lt wasn´t a date.
l said l was sorry. l´ll talk to her.
lt´s no big deal.
-lt is a big deal, Kristy.
-We could lose the camp.
l said l´d handle it, okay?
-l gotta meet Luca.
-l gotta sit for Becca.
Come on, Mary Anne,
the Newtons are coming over for dinner.
l have to finish my novel.
Dawn, watch this.
-ls that cool?
-How´d you do that?
l´ll show you sometime.
They found a new home.
What do you say we give them
a housewarming party?
-A party?
-Why would we want to give them a party?
-l´m trading you guys in.
-A party?
Last night at dinner l practically
told my mom and Watson twice.
l don´t know how long l can do this.
How long is he gonna be ´´not here´´?
l don´t know.
Want some tahini?
l´ll pass, thanks.
-What´s up with you and Kristy?
-Nothing.
Doesn´t look like nothing.
You´re always whispering.
-That´s not true.
-lt is true.
-Should l get my ears pierced?
-Don´t change the subject.
Please don´t be mad at me, okay?
Look, l´d tell you if l could. l swear.
But l promised Kristy.
Go be her sister then.
Okay, so oxygen´s kind of white.
So, it´d be in the white blood cells.
Right, Kristy?
What did you say?
Kristy, you know,
you´re not helping me here.
l know. l just....
Can we do this tomorrow?
Wake up, Kristy. lf l fail,
l´m gonna have to quit the club.
Maybe that´s what you want.
-l´m sorry, okay?
-That´s not good enough.
-She said she was sorry.
-Mary Anne, stay out of this.
-l can´t do your work and my work, too.
-She said she was sorry.
-l never asked you to.
-Yes, you did.
Are we fighting?
We never fight.
-Jessi, l gotta go.
-Where?
Could you just pack up
my equipment for me?
Okay.
l am so tired.
lf l fail my final, my life is ruined.
You won´t fail.
Pass the yellow paint, please.
-What?
-She wants the yellow paint.
Jessi, where´s Kristy?
She had to leave, but can l help?
Jessi, Nina Marshall can´t find Jimmy-Tony.
She said you know where he is.
Hi, Nina. Hi, Jimmy-Tony.
Jimmy-Tony´s not there.
Hold on, David Michael. l´ll be right back.
-Nice dress.
-Thanks. l know an apartment you can get.
-lt´s got a fireplace and l can make you chili.
-Just what l want.
-That´s the only thing l know to make.
-Perfect.
-You like chili?
-l love chili.
Good. And you can come watch me coach.
There´s this kid Jackie Rodowsky.
He´s on my team.
-Jackie Rodowsky?
-Yeah.
-He´s a total klutz, but he´s special.
-How´s that rocket arm of yours?
Not bad. How´s yours?
Kristy, would you please come in here
for a minute?
What?
Where were you?
l had to pick up some stuff for the camp.
You forgot to pick up
something pretty important.
Like what?
Like your brother.
ls he okay?
He tried to come home by himself.
l don´t want to think
about what would´ve happened...
if Mr. Kishi hadn´t found him
and brought him home.
Mom, l´m really sorry.
l can´t believe you let this happen.
What were you thinking?
David Michael´s only seven.
What if something had happened to him?
He knows his way.
Nothing would´ve happened.
-How do you know?
-lt was a mistake, okay?
You can´t make mistakes like that,
not with children.
-Especially with your younger brother.
-But David Michael´s fine.
-He might not have been fine.
-l get the point, okay?
lt´s not like you to be so irresponsible.
l don´t understand.
What has gotten into you lately?
Yeah, you don´t understand.
You wouldn´t understand!
Understand what? What don´t l understand?
-Leave me alone!
-What don´t l understand?
l´m not gonna leave you alone.
l am your father.
-l want to know what´s going on.
-You´re not my father!
l felt horrible about David Michael
and what l said to Watson.
And l knew if Claud didn´t pass
it´d be mostly my fault.
l saw a tree eat a dog.
-What kind of dog?
-A green one.
-Excuse me.
-l once ate an anthill.
Did you get bad breath?
You look very pretty today.
And l love what you´re doing
for the environment.
Thank you, Alan.
Yeah. lt makes me wanna fly.
lt´s cool your folks are letting us
use the cabin.
My mom´s gonna drive us out,
and she promised...
she´d keep my brothers out of our way.
Kristy is gonna have the best birthday.
-l don´t know if she deserves it.
-Believe me, she deserves it.
She´s coming.
Guys, Luca asked me
to go to New York with him.
-No way!
-Are you gonna go?
l don´t know. lf my mom says
it´s okay with my dad, she might let me...
if Claudia comes.
Me? l can´t. l have to study.
lt´s not till after your test.
Today, using the BSC quick-study method...
you´re gonna learn about the human body!
-Don´t bother. lt doesn´t interest me.
-Does the Baby-sitters Club interest you?
-lt´s my life.
-Then get interested.
Claud didn´t know that we had come up
with a BSC emergency plan...
that would make it impossible for her to fail.
lf you wanna run, if you wanna jump
You gotta get your left
and right ventricles to pump
Through the heart, the center of it all
-Surprised?
-Yep.
And you might just fall
Down to the ground
which will cause you pain
But that´ll never happen
if you use your brain
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain
That´ll never happen if you use your brain
Neurons run through the cortex
into the frontal lobe
Past the hypothalamus, it´s good to go
lnto the cerebellum
it´s the best thing that could happen
´Cause we´re the baby-sitters
and we´ll always be rappin´
And singing and thinking is the best
Now you better go and study
so you pass your science test
Now you better go and study
so you pass your science test
lf you do your homework
you can almost feel it
Pumping to the brain, pumping to the brain
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain
-You guys. All your lucky stuff.
-We hope they help.
Here, Claud. They´re my lucky shoelaces.
l was wearing them
when l got my first home run.
Thanks, guys.
-l could use all the help l can get.
-We´re with you, Claud.
The neurons run through the cortex
into the frontal lobe
-Past the hypothalamus it´s good to go
-´´lt´s good to go, into the cerebellum....´´
The brain, the brain, the center of the chain
-Hey, Claud.
-Hi, Kristy.
-How´d the test go?
-l think okay.
That´s great. So what are you doing?
Stacey´s mom is here
and we may go to New York.
So l can´t talk. Bye.
-Hello?
-Mary Anne?
Kristy, what´s up?
Nothing. l just talked to Claudia.
She sounded kind of weird.
Are you okay?
Yeah. No.
All this sneaking around,
l just feel like a rat.
So do l.
They´re ganging up on me, too.
Dawn´s practically not even talking to me.
l don´t know what to do.
lf l tell the truth,
l´ll betray my dad, lf l don´t...
l´m lying to my mom and all my friends.
You´ve already done that.
And you got me doing it, too.
Call you later.
Kristy, look at Nannie´s tomatoes.
They´re huge.
This year she´s singing them show tunes.
They´re a lot bigger than that year
she was singing them torch songs.
-Wanna try one?
-No, thanks.
You don´t know what you´re missing.
-Mom?
-Yes, sweetie.
l....
You have a piece of tomato on your chin.
Good night, Mom.
-Do you want one?
-Why don´t you keep it?
Can you pass the mustard?
-What?
-She wants the mustard.
-Kristy, l hit one yesterday.
-Jackie, that´s incredible.
Well, l kind of hit it.
Hit my bat, then kind of fell off.
Probably the closest one to a home run
l´m ever gonna hit in my life.
And you didn´t see it.
Jackie, you´re gonna hit more.
All you needed was one to break the ice.
Yeah.
You really let him down, Kristy.
-Give it a rest, Claud.
-No, Claud´s right.
-What is up with you, Kristy?
-You´re always leaving so early.
You´re acting so weird.
-You´re always late.
-Yeah.
-You have a responsibility here.
-You owe us.
-l can´t tell you.
-But you can tell Mary Anne.
She´s my best friend.
Everything´s gonna be okay, sweetie.
You just hang in there.
What are you thinking?
-lt´s hard.
-Yeah, l know.
Claudia flunked a quiz,
and l was supposed to help her.
That was a while ago, wasn´t it?
You did everything you could do.
You talking to your boyfriend?
David Michael, leave your sister alone.
-There´s just a lot going on here.
-You want to change phones?
-l´ll call you later.
-0kay.
-You okay?
-Yeah, fine.
-You sure? Who were you talking to?
-Nobody.
Seem a little upset.
l have an allergy, okay?
What´s wrong? Are you crying?
Can´t you just leave me alone?
l have an allergy, okay?
-What are you allergic to?
-Summer.
Remember when l took you to Monty´s?
You wouldn´t get off The Monster?
The only 5-year-old that
wouldn´t get off the Ferris wheel.
How about for your birthday we go back
and ride The Monster till we puke?
Hi, Meggy!
How about a box seat?
Dad, why´d you come back
if you´re just gonna hide?
To see you. l missed you.
But, Dad, you could´ve come before.
Nothing was stopping you.
l tried.
Dad, you sent two cards
in five years or something.
l was always thinking you´d come.
You never did. Ever.
l´d wait for you every year.
You never even called.
You don´t care about me and everyone
who does care about me is mad at me!
l can´t do this anymore!
l´ve never lied to Mom or my friends.
And since you got here,
that´s all l´ve been doing and l hate it!
lt´s all your fault!
l´m gonna tell Mom you´re here.
Kristy, we had a deal.
Dad, l´m breaking it,
just like you broke all your promises.
l´m here, aren´t l?
Look....
l´m sorry, okay?
l know l haven´t been there for you.
l know there´s nothing l can do
about the past.
But there is something l can do
about right now, about you and me.
Come here.
Tell you what.
On your birthday, when l take you
to Monty´s, l´ll pick you up at home...
and we´ll tell everybody
the good news together. Okay?
-Really?
-l promise.
That´s the best present
you could ever give me.
Wait a minute.
l need a real hug.
-Dawn, you okay today?
-Yeah. Why wouldn´t l be?
l don´t know. Why wouldn´t you be?
Okay, the place has to be squeaky clean
for the civic committee on Monday.
You´re driving out with us
for your party, right?
l´m gonna be a little late, but l´ll be there.
-l have my own ride. Okay?
-Okay.
l can´t breathe in here.
Why aren´t any of the windows open?
My hair is drooping.
l need some air. l need some hairspray.
My gosh, it´s Claudia. l hope she passed.
-Did we flunk?
-This could be the worst day of our lives.
l got a B minus.
Can you believe it? l passed!
Look out, New York!
Stace and Claud stayed at Stacey´s dad´s...
and the next day, he took them everywhere.
He showed them Central Park...
The Plaza hotel, Rockefeller Center...
and then the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
for Claud.
That night, he dropped them off
at a teen club downtown...
to meet Luca and his friends.
That was after
he gave Luca the third degree...
about where they´d go and what they´d do.
Okay, have fun. lDs.
Damn cool place.
All right, boss.
All right.
Okay. Ladies, lDs.
l must´ve left it in my other wallet.
Sorry.
Come on, give her a break.
She´s 16. They both are.
l can´t let them in without lDs.
lt´s right here.
Sorry, babe. Nice try.
-She just showed you her lD.
-Yeah, and she ain´t no 16.
-So beat it.
-l´m almost...
sixteen.
Give this back to your girlfriend.
Get your lDs ready.
Damn it!
Thirteen?
-Can you stop saying that?
-l just can´t believe you´re only 13!
-Stop screaming in my ear.
-Stop screaming in my ear.
-You stay out of this!
-Don´t yell at her!
-My husband and l, we were engaged at 13.
-Stay out of this!
Don´t yell at her!
Can you let me out of here? Please.
-Don´t listen to her. She´s a child.
-Let me out of this cab!
-l´m not about to let two little girls--
-Shut up!
You know, l thought
maybe you weren´t quite 16.
l never imagined you were only 13.
-Thirteen!
-l wanna get out now!
Forget it. l promised your father
l´d take you home.
Thirteen.
Sorry.
The whole thing with Luca was a disaster.
We all felt so bad for Stace.
They say things usually look better
in the morning...
which is good, because we still
had three-and-a-half weeks of camp.
which is good, because we still
had three-and-a-half weeks of camp.
Flowers and dirt never make you hurt.
Vanessa, my parents came from a bear.
-What kind of bear?
-Alligators like to fly.
Where´d you get these?
-We picked them.
-From where?
-Oh, no! My Antirrhinum majus!
-Your what?
-My snapdragons!
-Mrs. Haberman, please calm down.
Calm down?
These aberrations that you call children...
have beheaded my precious flowers...
as though they´re nothing
more than cauliflower!
-We´ll replace them. l promise.
-Replace them?
You don´t understand.
They´re completely traumatized.
l grew these little babies from seeds.
All right, l warned you.
l´m calling the city.
No! Wait!
Alan, can you look after my group
for a few minutes?
This Alan?
Mrs. Haberman!
l´m really sorry, Mrs. Haberman.
l´ve grown these since spring.
They´re only herbs: sage and rosemary.
They won´t make up for what happened
or replace your beautiful flowers.
But they´re delicious,
and they smell so nice...
and l would really like you to have them.
You´re right. They don´t.
l planted those flowers
especially for the butterflies...
and the hummingbirds.
l think hummingbirds are magical.
They look like little jewels.
-What´s your name again?
-Dawn.
Dawn. How ´60s.
l do appreciate the gesture, Dawn.
Thank you very much.
l was just gonna have some tea.
You want some?
-Sure. Thanks.
-Come on.
You know, l´m really sorry about that.
ls that you in those pictures?
That one´s in Vietnam. This was Berlin.
l happened to be there
the night the wall came down.
That´s Africa. l was on safari.
l had the most amazing conversation
with that water buffalo.
-ls herbal all right for you?
-Sure.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
Oat straw. l used to drink this with my dad.
Really?
He´s still in California.
That´s where l grew up.
California.
They have some exquisite
ruby-crowned kinglets there.
That is if the pollution hasn´t killed them all.
lt was still pretty nice when l was there.
l used to sit at the bottom
of this redwood tree all the time.
And do what?
Nothing.
Yes. Quiet can be a lovely companion.
One that l´ve missed lately.
Dawn, you´re almost delightful.
Thank you.
But l don´t know
how much more l can stand.
Please, it´s only for a few more days.
How many days is a few more days?
Several.
And is several more or less than a few?
l don´t know.
Well, then l don´t know either.
-Honey, Luca´s outside.
-Tell him l´m not here.
You´ll feel a lot better if you go out there
and talk to him.
No, l won´t.
He´s called six times. The least
you could do is hear what he has to say.
He´s pretty good on that thing.
-You´re trying too hard to impress her.
-But that´s what you told me to do.
Well, don´t try so hard.
But you said before,
´´Whatever you do, don´t be yourself.´´
You think if you were yourself
she´d like you?
l don´t know.
Shut the door on your way out, okay?
Nice work, you guys.
She likes me. Yeah, she really likes me.
Okay.
-Looks great.
-Thanks.
-Almost done.
-Cool.
-Mary Anne. Can l put this here?
-Sure.
-What do you think?
-Perfect.
-Strathmore lnn.
-Hi.
Yeah. Patrick Thomas, please.
0ne moment.
Hey, birthday girl.
-What time are they picking you up?
-Soon.
-Sorry, he´s checked out.
-Wish l was going to the lake.
-Did he leave a note or....
-There´s nothing here.
Would you check again, please?
l just came on duty and l don´t see anything.
He was supposed to pick me up,
but l must´ve gotten it wrong.
-Maybe l was supposed to meet him.
-0kay.
-Okay, thanks.
-Bye.
-She´ll be here any minute.
-She´s been late all summer.
Why is the cake melting?
Who bought an ice-cream cake?
Ladies, we can do some major damage here.
Wait until the civic committee
gets a load of this.
Okay. There´s more shaving cream
in the bag.
Hand me a can!
l can´t. l´m stuck.
Me, too.
Yeah, right. Like this is really wet cement.
Kind of looks that way to me.
Your attention, folks.
Due to the storm,
Monty´s Fun City is now closing.
Dad? Daddy?
You okay?
Monty´s Fun City is now closing.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
-Good night, Mike.
-See you.
-Mallory?
-Kristy!
-Mallory, l´m at--
-Kristy? Hello?
Hello?
We got cut off.
-Where is she?
-l don´t know.
-l promised.
-Something horrible could´ve happened.
We have to find her.
Kristy´s dad came back.
Her real dad.
-We have to call her mom.
-No.
-Kristy made me swear. We can´t tell anyone.
-We can´t just sit here.
-When are your parents getting home?
-Late.
We need a car to get there.
l think l know someone.
Mister!
-Kristy, are you okay?
-We´ve been looking everywhere for you!
We were so worried!
Thanks.
Come on, Kristy. We gotta get you warm.
l´m soaked.
Luca, l know l´ve been a real nightmare...
and you can´t wait to be with your friends.
Sometimes l don´t know how to be myself.
-l never met anyone like you.
-Are you finished?
And l wanted to get to know you.
l haven´t told you something.
l´m coming back next summer.
-You are?
-Yeah.
-l´ll be 1 4.
-l know.
Bye.
Life´s a joke.
l remember last year when my grandma died,
l stayed in my room and cried for two days.
l didn´t think l´d ever feel good again.
l felt the same way
when my mom and dad split up.
Me, too. lt´s the worst.
l feel so stupid.
l really believed him this time.
lt´s not your fault, Kristy.
But l thought l was more important to him.
You´re important to us.
l screwed up your whole summer.
Okay, so this summer was your turn.
l can´t believe you guys
are still talking to me.
Are you still talking to me?
Only if l can borrow your plaid jacket
for the rest of the year.
-Deal.
-l wouldn´t have yelled at you if l´d known.
Yeah, you would´ve.
Okay, l guess l would´ve.
Make a wish.
Friends forever.
You guys.
What kind of cake is this, anyway?
You guys.
l can´t believe he was here for over a month
and you never told me.
You think l liked not telling you?
lt was really hard.
Well, l´m sure it was hard,
but that doesn´t make it right to lie.
-He made me promise.
-He shouldn´t have done that.
But he said on my birthday
we were going to tell you.
l could wring his neck for doing this to you.
Maybe if l´d been different,
he wouldn´t have done it.
No, you´re not supposed
to be the grownup here.
Your father says he´s gonna do
a lot of things that he doesn´t do.
Why is he like that?
Honey, l don´t know.
l believed him, too.
l´m glad we got to spend time together.
He made me laugh.
l know.
That´s one of the most wonderful things
about him.
He loves you, you know.
But not the way
you and Watson love me, right?
This was in the mailbox for you.
Wait.
´´Dear Kristy,
l want to tell you this in person...
´´but l don´t have the heart
or the guts, l guess.
´´The job didn´t work out.
Can you believe it? After all that.
´´Hope your birthday´s great.
Remember, l owe you a ride on The Monster.
´´Love, Dad.
´´PS: Seeing you meant everything to me.
´´l´m so sorry l let you down
and put you in a tough spot with your mom.
´´l´ll never do it again.
´´l´m on my way to Colorado.
´´Chris Almond told me there´s an opening
for a stringer on the paper there.´´
Great, Dad. Colorado. What´s next?
Your father is full of dreams.
Just like you.
Don´t ever give them up.
What happened?
No!
-What´s happening here?
-What´s going on?
-What did they do to this place?
-What happened, Kristy?
The civic committee is coming today.
What are we gonna do?
-We´re dead meat.
-My flowers!
What´d they do to my paints?
-Look at this mess.
-l can´t believe this.
-Look at this place.
-lt´s disgusting.
Don´t be sad.
You guys! Look!
lt´s like that thing in Hollywood.
She melted.
That girl is building up
some very bad karma.
The civic committee
was coming in two hours.
Cokie had really creamed us this time.
Then Claud, using a very brilliant
scientific method...
figured out that shaving cream
and toilet paper clean pretty well.
This time we did all the grunt work.
And with the help of the kids,
we got that place cleaned up in record time.
And best of all,
Claud and l were friends again.
l don´t believe this.
They saw a problem,
and they worked hard to solve it.
What are you saying?
Being good gets you somewhere?
Being bad didn´t.
l mean, we wasted our whole summer.
You didn´t waste it. You were with me.
You got an education.
Ready?
The civic committee showed up.
Just our luck, right on time.
Did they say anything?
-You´ve shown a lot of civic pride.
-Yes.
And we would love to grant your request
to use the structure.
We´ve done it!
But l´m afraid it´s not possible.
-Why?
-You charge for your services, don´t you?
Definitely.
Then you consider yourself
more a business than a club.
Absolutely.
-And your business makes you money?
-What good business doesn´t?
l believe we have a problem.
Our charter states that any facility....
Bird Face is on the committee? We´re dead.
They wanted the place for their garden club,
and give us a commemorative plaque.
Come off it, Harold.
We´re not talking about
a multimillion-dollar corporation here.
How much money
could their business possibly make?
Our expenses ran a little away from us.
l mean, between start-up costs,
freebies, camp supplies...
the money to fix up this place
and miscellaneous expenses...
our total profit...
is $168.1 7.
What?
-That´s all?
-l can´t breathe. l have to go.
They´re dropping like flies.
lf memory serves me correctly...
our committee bylaws state
that any company...
must show a profit of $1,500 a year
to qualify as a viable business.
These girls are obviously nowhere near that.
Therefore, l see no reason
why they can´t use this as their office.
Fine. Do whatever you want, Emily.
l don´t care.
l need some air.
l don´t think they´re quite used
to this tropical environment.
Reminds me of my days in Calcutta.
ls it always gonna be this hot in here?
lt was turning into an amazing day.
We got the greenhouse.
Jackie hit his first home run.
Cokie got it so bad...
l knew it was the last time the BSC
would ever hear from Cokie Mason.
For this summer, anyway.
All right, Jackie!
Way to go, Jackie!
Will you go to the movies with me tonight?
Alan, get real.
l am.
l´ve been trying to ask you out all summer.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Are you lovebirds yet?
When l got home,
there was another letter from my dad.
l couldn´t believe l heard from him so soon.
lt used to be years between letters.
Now it´s days.
$168.1 7.
We had a lot of overhead.
Most businesses
don´t even survive their first year.
We had to work out all the kinks.
Are we taking the bed, Claudia?
-We can´t take my furniture.
-What will we sit on?
Can we take the rug?
-l´m gonna miss it here.
-Me, too.
-Where it all began. Right, Claud?
-Right.
Can you get the licorice
from my nightstand?
l don´t want to forget it.
We spent some of the best years
of our lives in this place.
lt´s so nice and cool in here.
lt´s almost gone.
-What?
-Summer.
-Hi, Mrs. Haberman!
-Hello, Dawn.
l´m sorry to bother you, but....
The more we thought about it,
Claud´s room really was home.
And Mrs. Haberman
had really come through for us.
So, we figured
after what we´d put her through...
the least we could do
was give her the greenhouse.
lt´s all yours, Mrs. Haberman.
-What do you mean?
-Come on.
We thought you could use it.
Might help you grow
all your flowers and stuff.
We asked the nursery for whatever
might attract hummingbirds and butterflies.
The sunflowers were my idea.
l guess Stoneybrook could use
a nature conservancy.
You guys are gonna end up
with your names on a plaque after all.
Okay, we´ll put those there.
All right, everybody. Come on. Group shot.
After buying Mrs. Haberman plants
and getting our answering machine...
all we were left with was $18.
So we splurged and blew the whole thing
on an extra-large pizza...
double cheese, double sauce,
double anchovies.
Dawn had a tricolore salad, whatever that is.
Mary Anne couldn´t believe we worked
the whole summer and got only a pizza.
But l think we got a lot more than that.
Claudia wasn´t the only one
with a test this summer.
Each of us was tested in our own way.
We really learned what it meant
to come through for each other...
and how hard that can be.
But l guess that´s what it takes sometimes
to really be a friend.
Mom says, ´´lf you can count the number
of friends you have on one hand...
´´that´s a lot. ´´
l´ve got five fingers
and more than five friends.
All right, everybody. Lean in.
Mom says l´m way ahead. l think she´s right.
And say, ´´trees.´´
Trees!
-What do you wanna do now?
-l don´t know. What do you wanna do?
-l don´t know. What do you wanna do?
-l don´t know. What should we do?
-l don´t know.
-l don´t know, either!
lf you don´t know, l don´t know.
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah.
-What do you wanna eat?
-l don´t know.
l don´t know, either.
-Where do you wanna go?
-l don´t know.
l don´t know, either.
-What about you?
-l don´t know.
You guys are useless. l´m going home.
