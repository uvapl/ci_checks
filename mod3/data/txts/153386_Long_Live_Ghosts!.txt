Johnny, couldn't I eat...
this... worm instead?
- No, you couldn't. Eating a worm
doesn't prove your courage.
It only proves
you're a pig.
Come on, Wendellin.
Adamek!
- Yes.
Here.
- And from now on the only guys we allow
in at the castle are those who sign
their names inside the hunger-tower.
Is that clear?
- Sure.
- Go!
First names too?
- First names too.
There are too many lights on.
- It'll be dark,
by the time they get there.
- Hmm...
- I bet you don't eat it!
- Yuck!
- You're all yeller!
Why on earth didn't we come and sign
our names in the daytime?
- It's not the same thing by day.
Goats graze there in the daytime.
Come on, faster! Quicker!
- And at night?
- What... what at night?
- What sort of abnormal thing goes
on there at night?
- Abnormally, nothing.
Normally, there are ghosts.
Hooray for the ghosts!

Wait.
- Look here, Wendellin,
you're keeping us.
You've been before.
- Yeah.
Are you very scared?
- Medium bad.
How much is that, medium bad?
- Well,
the top hair is willing to go on,
but the lower half doesn't want to.
- Come on, boy.

Come on.
Here's the chalk.
Don't keep us!
Let's go!
There. I'm first, and highest up.
- John said sign our names,
he didn't say how high.
- Hurry up. You're taking too long
about it.
- If you had a name as long as mine,
it would take you longer too.
If you realize that there was someone
chained up to this, and that they
tortured him by hunger...
Stop that!
Why do you keep sighing and moaning,
you chump?
I don't care, you can't scare me.
But what if you do give me a fright and
my legs go wooden, then you'll have to
carry me back on your back.
Look what you've done!
And I got it done so nicely.
What was that?
- That was supposed to have been...
hush...
- I'm asking you what you hit me with?
- Me?
- Who else?
My legs.
- Legs?
- Gone all wooden.
- Whose?
- Mine.
There's a... there's a...
Oh, there's a ghost in our castle, home,
boys and fast cause we're in a most
frightful and ghostly mess,
The night air
is aswoosh and aswish with ghosts,
you can hear them quite clearly
if you don't scram,
you'll pay for it dearly,
there's a smell of sulphur in the air,
The White Lady will slap you down
with her lily-white hand
and a vampire is just
searching for a victim urchin.
From the scientific point
of view the White Lady...
- Don't exist!
- But what if she's here after all?
- She doesn't exist!
- From the scientific point
of view the Vampire...
- Don't exist!
- But what if there's one here
after all?
- Doesn't exist!
Our castle, our castle, our castle
is aswish and aswoosh with ghosts.
Let's get home fast, kids.
Or we'll he in frightful trouble.
The chalk!
- We left it there... simpler that way.
Than carrying it back and forth all
the time.
- Hmm. Come along, then.
- Listen, what was it you heard
up there.
- Aaah!
- That was the wind.
- Run along!
- That was the first time the wind
hit me, slapped my bottom, in fact.
Hallucinations.
A ghost would need a drill to get
through this floor.
Go away, strangers.
Except here, maybe looks
as if it were hollow here.
Help!
Help! Help!
- Well, here we go.
Don't sit and stare!
Follow me!
Quick! Quick!
Wait for me, boys!
No landing jumps!
- It was nothing, of the sort.
I tripped.
Wendellin!
I'm scared to go in.
- Stay out here, then.
- But I'm scared out here too.
- Come with us, then.
And keep shouting at the top
of your voice.
That's the best thing against being
scared.
- Aaaaaaah!
Hold on boys, reinforcements are
on the way! Hold on!
Aaaaaah!
Aaaaaah!
Stop it!
You're fighting each other like madmen.
- He must be invisible.
He must have got a licking too,
but it doesn't show.
- Where could he be?
- Could have crashed through
when I stomped on it.
Come and take a look.
And what's that over there?
Is that supposed to be normal?
Come on.
- Come and look.
Miracle!
Gentlemen,
another miracle!
- What now?
- Your eyes going black.
- Honest? That's awtul.
I have to go to the meeting tomorrow.
- Aaaaah...
- What's this screaming and whining?
Where does it come from?
What's the matter with you?
What are you screaming for?
- You can stop now. It's all over.
That was Warning Number One!
What does it look like?
So what Mr. Zizka only had one eye too
and we still learn about him
in history lesson.
Look here, if you don't touch it
and if you don't sweat
and if you don't blink, it'll be O.K.
And look here, John, mind they don't get
you scared.
Say you're representing twenty children
from our village.
Why,, children"?
He can say young people, can't he!?
- Of course...
- Young people, sure.
So that you represent twenty
young people from our village
and if they keep gabbing about wanting
some activity on our part,
well let them hand over that castle
and fast.
- Sure! That's right!
Ca Br Co Cha
A Castle Brtnik Cooperative Chairman
The last point will be taken up by
Mr. Vavra, the headmaster.
As you know I shall be retiring
next year.
We all would like to leave something
behind us. Some of us write
their memoirs -
- I spent my time writing applications
for something to be done
with our Castle Brtnik.
Nothing over came of it.
The historical monuments people are
planning to take it in hand
in five years time.
But now we suddenly have a proposal
presented by our children,
which I am sure you have all read.
- Yeah, we've read it... And I'll tell
a thing or two about it, if I...
- Before we start discussing
the situation,
maybe we should ask the boy to come in.
- Yes.
John, come in, my boy.
Good afternoon.
- Sit down, my boy.
- Thank you.
- Sit down, do.
Well, I read what those children wrote.
And it looks pretty stupid to me.
Don't you think so too?
- Hmm, Hmm.
- Who ever heard of such a thing.
Giving the castle to the kids...
Is that supposed to be normal?
Jouza was the speaker.
John stood there, his eye was quite
normal, at least-nobody noticed a thing.
Mrs. Pilat, alias The Black Chronicle,
sat there making stupid faces
and nodding.
She always makes stupid faces and nods.
We don't won't the whole castle,
just the tower.
We'd install a club-room inside
the tower and a museum downstairs.
- My sister-in-law here, Mrs. Pilat,
would tell you
what kids are capable of without
supervision.
Would my sister-in-law Mrs. Pilat
please tell you
what kids are capable of
without supervision. Please.
At the village of Kukleny two boys
went out and walked up to a hayrick.
With the aid of two stones they
experimented introducing a spark,
the experiment was successful and
the rick burnt down to the last letter
Ehm. The last straw.
In the village of Vrana - Plostice
a group of youngsters played about with
the dike of a two-hectare pond until
they let all the water out.
At the village of Bouchalka
two youngsters
loosened the brake of an excavator.
The,, Black Chronicle" keeps grinding
her axe.
We should go and take a look at those
strawberries of hers.
She doesn't need any vitamins any more,
anyway.
- That's a fact.
- Yes.
Her garden needs supervision,
and badly.
...with dynamite, too, and they threw
a whole warehouse of carded yarns
to kingdom come.
- And don't forget reading out
what happened at the village of Hulin,
sister-in-law.
At the village of Hulin
some youngsters...
- Don't you think that's enough?
So you seem to think that... sit down,
my boy... so you think that... eh,
that the children could damage
the castle.
Don't cry, John we haven't lost yet.
So you think it's better to leave that
castle as it is, to let it fall to utter
ruin, than try entrusting
to the children?
- Watch out!
No, I have accounter-proposal as to how
to make good use for the castle.
If you'll excuse the expression,
but horse manure
mixed with good soil
changes into so-called humus,
which is a good thing for us,
because we'll make mushrooms grow
for us.
This is a project
that'll bring in money
for me, for you and for him,
and even the press will write us up.
Golden words, my eyes are sparkling
when I see that gold mine,
brother-in-law!
- I think that's plan without a flaw!
What do things look like now?
Nothing but castles in the air
this time mushrooms!
- Oh...
Stuff mushrooms.
Butter, yolks and salt.
- Excuse me for the expression
but that damned old castle
with all that damned humidity
will be just the right thing
for us.
And those kids so uppity
will stand in line at last
and get a basket
and good and fast
they'll fill those baskets full!
And we'll have lined them up at last!
Golden words, my eyes are sparkling,
when I see that gold mine,
brother-in-law!
I am sure that is a plan without a flaw!
- Stuff mushrooms.
Butter, yolks and salt.
Looks bad, the Head's all sad
and John's eye's watering.
Put this down: Revenge for Jouza,
good and hard.
Project number one: Our revenge
on Jouza...
How can you spell the stupid name?
J or G?
J, to go with revenge!
Jouza, Jouza, Jouza...
You never change.
All you could ever do
at lessons was arithmetic.
You never liked history,
nothing but spelling mistakes
when you tried writing something
in your mother tongue.
And now you want to cultivate mushrooms
at our castle only because
it'll being in money.
- I'm manager of our grocery store
and thus happen to be a businessman,
I am accustomed to adding up
and subtracting all the time.
And please come and look
at our Book of Complaints and Wishes.
Not a single item.
Nothing but clean pages.
Which of course doesn't mean to say
I have anything whatsoever against
monuments
or against children.
On the contrary!
I like our young pioneers.
But think about this
how... could such a child roof
that tower in all by itself?
- What's crop of accidents
that would bring on!
In the village of Dolanky
some youngsters...
- Wait, sister-in-law!
Listen, my boy, can you make a roof?
You see, he doesn't know
what to do about
that roof, and he's actually crying.
Such a roof would cost
about fifty thousand.
And can our cooperative such an outlay?
- We don't have that much.
- Well,
and on the other hand my proposal
needs no capital at all.
On the contrary, the old castle call
fall to bits without it bothering us,
and it would actually bring
in some decent cash!
I call the vote.
Who is in favour of mushrooms?
And who's for the children?
It's two against two.
Push me down with a feather!
An accident!
A youngster rached down from a tree!
Come here, where did you take it?
Pound it some place?
- Made it.
- What of?
- Spare parts.
- Where did you get the spare parts?
- Found them, in bad.
- Don't be impertinent, boy!
- I'm not impertinent.
Our house stands in a blind bend and
I get a bumper or headlight flying into
my bed often.
What I need now in a steering-wheel.
You're a clever pioneer, my boy.
We're going to use it for transporting
horse dung. Come, sister-in-law.
I beg your pardon?
- Dung, my boy, dung.
Get right in, the Castle Rocket will
take you to the castle nearly a quickly
as if you walked.
- Wait, Joe.
It looks like the mushrooms are winning.
- I'd like a ride.
Is it safe?
- The brakes come off a Mercedes, Sir.
- Ehm.
- Came flying in last week.
Call in the guards a page-boy's
gone off his head,
says he wants to conquer the castle.
The page-boy is rolling downhill
with a fast-range cannon ball
you can laugh if you like.
Maybe you think that the page-boy
cannot manage
cannot manage to conquer such a castle.
But you don't know this page-boy
with the fast-range cannon ball
it can well happen he'll
manage after all.
Dear
grown-ups,
kindly get out of your beds
Call the guards
a page-boy's gone off his head
says he's going to conquer the castle.
And you don't know this page-boy
with the fast-range cannonball
it can well happen he'll manage
to do just that after all.
Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Yes!
It does need a new roof,
Jouza's right there.
He isn't always right, actually, but
this time he is.
What this needs is a new roof, but...
- And if we got the wood
and the roofers together?
Ha! If wishes were horses...
- Please Sir...
- Well.
- Little Kid here has an uncle
who's a roofer, isn't he?
- Uncle can't right now,
he's a sun lighting.
- What are you talking about, silly?
Moonlighting, then...
I see.
- Moonlighting, then...
Well, maybe we'd manage to get the wood.
If you want and asked Mr. Kochanek
the forester,
maybe he'd let you have a few trees
for the rafters.
But you would have to be clever.
But sensitive man,
but gets angry easily.
- I heard, he wanted to become an actor
when he was young, is it true?
- Yes, yes, out forester wanted
to become an opera singer,
but his parents wouldn't let him,
so now does his screaming in the forest.
The forester's the lord of the forest
the game all love him
The forester's the king of the forest
and every poacher always feared him.
What's happening?
Is my forest on fire?
Or are the pole-cats at large?
Could it be a poacher? Or a thief?
And me doing nothing as if I were
on relief.
Don't you worry, Sir.
Everything's all right.
And we'll excuse your home attire.
Meeouw.
We have a grand plan
and we've come to ask you to join us.
Give us a few trees!
And give them to us as a gift.
Take your axe and start hacking away
but oh, my that's impossible.
The State owns these forests.
So that - you have to pay.
- Or they'll take you away in handcuffs!
I promise on behalf of the girls
I promise on behalf of the boys
to plant a hundred little trees
for every tree you give us.
That's what I call a project!
That's settled and arranged, then.
The forester is the king of the forest
the game love him and so do the kids,
The forester is the king of the forest.
The game love him and so do the kids.
And we're got our trees and our rafters!
During the long winter evenings
of the past
when people spent their time
doing things like draying feathers
they heard the wind howling,
and they make up their story
about the Howler.
And that writing of yours...
I guess that's phosphorus.
For example decaying wood...
Wild Barbara!
A curse upon you!
A curse upon you!
Hear, you mortals,
this castle is mine! Mine!
Let me never see you here again!
Or woe betide you!
Oh, oh...
Jeez!
Jeez!
Well, are these things make-believe
or ghosts?
- Your torch!
Look!
Hah?
No, it's no make-believe, children,
neither is it a ghost. It's a man.
- Boys, shop's closed, we're taking
over some new wares.
Bohacek's playing at shops.
- I find it. Must have fallen out
of somebody's pocket.
- Jouza!
- That's it.
He always sticks it to the doors of
the shop!
So you see, children, no ghosts, just
plain old Mr. Jouza.
And the other guy, who hit him?
Mrs. Pilat.
- Stuff and nonsense!
Is that the Howler you were talking
about?
- Well...
- Be quiet!
Come here, boys.
Encircle him.
Come and encircle him!
...the swallow likes singing
because it's alive
Strange thoughts and grief.
And how about me?
Strange thoughts and grief.
And how about me?
The bride room's not at home.
Because he's getting married today.
The bride is waving to him
because she too is getting married.
Strange thoughts and grief.
And how about me?
Strange thoughts and grief.
And how about me?
L'm complaining to my shadow
who'll hand me a daisy ever
who'll warm my heart, of lover.
If my heart is snowed in?
Put those torches away!
Stop it!
Put those things away!
- What are you doing here?
- Can't you see?
I'm plaiting a wreath and singing.
- Listen,
what's your name?
- Gentlemen tell their name first.
- Look here.
Kid, this is our castle so you tell us
who you are and fast.
- You are wrong, pageboy,
this is our castle!
- Who're you calling,, pageboy"?
- Calm down, Joe,
Well,
they call me Long John.
I'm Leontina Brtnik of Castle Brtnik.
My daddy is Knight Brtnik of Brtnik.
Stop fibbing, there aren't any knights
any more.
Are there, Sir? Not these days.
I don't belong to these days either.
I'm from the past.
- Hmm, boys, Wendellin this sure
is a ghost,
gentlemen and its father's ghost too.
- But there are ghosts and ghosts,
my boy...
- Where's your father, child?
- Walking about the castle, of course.
- See, a ghost...
If you left us alone we wouldn't have to
make such an exhibition of our selves.
Whose work was that fiery lettering?
That was my magic.
But if was daddy who did the floor job
in the hunger-tower.
- How come she knows about that floor,
boys?
- Look here, girl, prove it.
- What am I to prove?
- That you can do magic, why don't you
make something useful for me
with that magic of yours - five crowns
for example.
I wouldn't know that, in my time.
But I will show you something.
Wait.
Stand back.
Whee-ho, turn into a doe,
whee-mag, turn into a stag.
- Jeez!
- Look!
- Guy...
- Jeez!
- Look!
Bohacek, come here,
don't go out into the forest,
the forester could shoot you down!
Boys,
tell him not to go.
Bohacek...
- Don't go, it's in your own interest
we're telling you!
Bohacek...
Ye Gods.
What do we do now?
- She'd do better to change him back to
what he was.
Leontina!
Where is she?
- Leontina?
Where is she?
- Let's go home, boys.
I'll have to think about all this.
- And what...
what about Bohacek?
- Joe!
- Bohacek!
What's up?
Where've you been?
- Grazing.
Grazing. Grazing...
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What's all this about, why the queue?
- Cottage cheese creams, Sir.
- Ah, very good for you.
Ah, very good for you.
- They still have five left.
- Just a moment, what's your name?
- Theresa.
- I see!
Good morning.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
A new cap, what - Jouza.
- Yes.
- Yes, very practical, I've been looking
for one of these for quite some time.
- I wear it because of the draught.
- Could I try it on?
- Never have there been such frequent
draughts as this year.
Yes.
And it's June.
What are we going to do in July?
- Let me see.
But what happened to you, my boy?
- Oh, one of the shelves...
Headmaster...
one of the shelves, hit my head with it.
I was putting goods away
into the shelves, you see,
and just then the cash-desk goes
and calls out at me.
- Manager!
Gosh!
See, just like that.
Just like that.
- They want the book of complaints.
- Who does?
- We do.
- And why?
- There aren't
any cottage cheese creams.
- They'll be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow's too late.
- Why?
- Every day,
- Every day,
- for supper
- cottage cheese,
- sweet and mild.
- If you want
- a healthy child,
- it wants
- cottage cheese,
- sweet and mild.
- Dairy products
are always healthy
and always will be, too!
Dairy products
are always healthy
and always will be, too!
Dairy products
are always healthy
and always will be, too!
Dairy products
are always healthy
and always will be, too!
I'll order two hundred cottage creams
for tomorrow!
Watch out, boys.
- Wait.
Here she comes.
- Look here, kid, you'd do better
to show up. We know about you anyway.
- Nobody can see us before the first
night-time bird takes flight.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Pardon?
- I said hello,
that's a salute.
- Oh, I see, hello then.
- Look here, we didn't finish talking
yesterday,
- you suddenly disappeared like a ghost.
- That's our way.
I'm very glad
you've come.
I longer for your presence greatly.
But my father is not glad.
- Your father's got quite a temper,
hasn't he?
- Well,
he is a man of temperamental moods.
- I bet that's the thing he knocked
Jouza out with.
- Temperamental moods means he gets mad,
man.
- Leontina!
Leontina!
- Come along.
Leontina!
Leontina!
Leontina!
Now to pass through
that wall like a ghost.
Where are you?
Leontina!
Uhm, where can he be?
Ouch!
Ouch. I said I was getting
too old for this...
Such a simple magic formula
and I get it wrong.
Who's going to straighten it out for me?
I'll be looking like an old tin soon.
Oh, oh, oh!
Leontina!
I'd better walk through the door.
Leontina!
Here I am!
Throw down your arms,
rebellious page-boys!
You'd want to match your strength
with mine?
- It's no good, boys,
he's got a panzer on.
- Hmm.
- Surely you wouldn't want to fight me,
you riff-raff?
- Look here, Mr. Knight,
either we come to
terms or we fight.
- Hush.
- Your arms?
I've got two,
what's that got to do with it?
- My father wants me to bring his arms,
I guess he wants his cross-bow
to shoot you down with.
- Wait. Leontina,
this is Long John, my dear.
Of course, such a likeness!
Just now he's only John,
I know, but he will be long
in no time at all, I promise.
- My name is John Long and I wish to
negotiate about your castle.
- Your great-great-grandfather
was a great fighter.
He saved my life at the Battle
of the Sausage.
- All the more reason
why we should come to terms.
By night the castle will be yours,
by day it'll be ours.
Leontina,
hand daddy a stone.
I'll show him something.
Ooh!
Body builder, I bet.
Hmm.
- Remember this...
...since time immemorial
this castle...
...belongs to the Brtnik family
of The Brtniks!
And it will belong to none other.
I am a knight of the glorious Red Seven,
White Lilly and Black...
Aaah!
Hole.
- Oh, dear!
- Are you all right, daddy?
- I have fallen into a trap,
dear daughter, and I've exhausted
today's ration of magic spells.
- He set that trap up for you.
- Aaah!
- Hey there, Mr. Knight,
we'll sort of find it easier
to negotiate now, won't we?
If you surrender to our conditions,
we'll pull you out.
- You won't pull me out,
page-boys.
- We aren't page-boys,
we're Pioneers.
- Not even as Pioneers can you
pull me out I weigh a ton.
- We have a right technology.
- I'm climbing up no ladder.
- Something better.
- Well, do we come to an agreement?
All right.
Your by day,
ours by night.
- Go!
When he's outside the pit,
loosen the rope.
- Mind that wooden thing!
Mind the belly!
Be careful!
- Up, down.
- Don't shoot!
- Watch the stick.
Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray!
Thank you.
Are you wounded, Sir?
- No, that's from the damp.
- I'll give you something for that.
- No more damp.
Castle Brtnik gets a new roof.
We have the wood, it was promised us.
Now we need the roofers
and we'll get started.
- If you were to be so good and unscrew
those trousers,
I'd oil that knee for you.
- Get is straight, Leontine!
Well.
May I, dear boy?
What sort of potion is it?
- Rubbing alcohol.
But that's what we rub backs with!
I mean knees.
- How foolish a generation to rub knees
with such an excellent drink.
- But...
Aaah.
Thank you, dear daughter, thank you.
- Midnight.
There'll be a royal row at home.
Goodbye, Mr. Knight, we'll be
seeing you. Come on, boys, come on.
- Goodbye, be seeing you.
- Goodbye.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Bye!
- Bye!
- Are you coming again?
- Sure thing.
- Sure thing means yes or no?
- It means we're coming for sure.
For sure.
Who is it?
- It's me, Jouza.
- Go and see what it's about, if it's
another moonlighting job, I'm busy,
I'm really much too busy.
- All right,
Mr. Mládek.
Remember,
should they come and ask you
to roof the tower over at the castle,
you just say you're too busy, see.
I've brought you a little something
to make up for it.
- Make up for what, for not going?
- That's right.
But watch out!
It's a secret.
- The Monastery Secret, yeah,
that's a great liquor.
Have you got nothing about ghosts of
any kind, please?
- About ghosts?
No.
The headmaster has borrowed all
the occult literature we have.
- And have you got anything about how
to heal strap-inflicted wounds?
They haven't got a thing.
The Head's borrowed it all.
Let's go!
Every day, every day,
for supper, cottage cheese,
sweet and mild.
If you want a healthy child,
give it cottage cheese.
Come right in, my Pioneers. Today I'm
well stocked in cottage cheese creams.
- Hard luck, we don't feel like cottage
cheese creams today.
- All I want is...
- Come right in, little girl,
and buy whatever.
...all I want is to alter
the mistake.
You call yourselves Pioneers?
What I am to do with two hundred
cottage cheese creams?
You've spelt it wrong.
You brats!
What I'd do to you if I...
- Oh...
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, cripes.
- I'm so sorry, excuse me!
- Cabbage!
- First quality cabbage.
- Your cabbage too, Mr. Jouza!
What shall I do?
- We'll just pick it up, there.
Do come again.
Do not trample it too much!
- Pass some water over!
You must stomp it down harder.
And you plant them deeper. This way
the water would carry of the soil.
Look.
Eva's doing it correctly.
- Aunty!
- What is it?
- Am I doing it correctly?
- Yes, you're doing fine, Little one.
- Look at hat!
- Look!
- Look! See that?
See that over there?
Where are you taking it?
- You wanted it, at the castle,
didn't you?
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray!...
The forest's the king of the forest
he keeps his, promise too
The forest's the king of the forest
the games love him and the children do,
too.
The forest's the king of the forest
the games love him and the children do.
Good morning.
Brother-in-law!
- What is it?
- Pazourek the roofer doesn't want
The Monastery Secret, he drinks whiskey.
- Isn't he greedy?
- Yes.
- Let him have this whiskey, hen.
Here.
- You know that here's wood
at the castle?
- What are they going to do
with the wood,
if they can't any roofers to do the job?
Just keep calm, sister-in-law.
Our motto?
- The Mushroom.
Leave off.
- What time is it?
This is beastly, we'll have to go home.
- I don't think we'll ever see her.
- I think I'd better go too. -
I'm not healed up yet.
Come!
- Wait, I've got an idea.
Mr. Knight,
come and look at what I've brought you!
- I've got a better idea!
Look!
Isn't it to early?
- Jeez!
- Girls!
- Oh, isn't she lovely!
What a pretty dress.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Malina, the Knight brought it for me
from Prague for my tenth birthday.
- How old are you, then? Eleven?
Like me?
- I'm four hundred years old.
- An old dame, what, Bohacek?
Did you call me, my boys?
- Chucks he game a shock.
- Chucks everybody.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Without the tin today?
- We are no longer enemies.
So why the armour and arms?
- Your health.
- Oh, that's an excellent grease.
What now?
- Don't, forget the surprise, daddy.
- That's right, that's right.
Looking at these planks,
about repairing our joint property,
the castle.
- We do.
- And judging by this therapeutic drink,
which I am sure you will go on bringing
up...
- We will.
...I would say
that you hold me in high esteem.
- We do.
- I shall therefore utter such a magic
spell, of such great force and extent,
as I am allowed but once in a hundred
years.
Step back and repeat after me:
All you dwarf roofers,
come climbing out of the moss!
- All you dwarf roofers,
come climbing out of the moss!
- Take up your tools
and build a new roof!
- Take up your tools
and build a new roof!
- Dwarfs from the rocks
dwarfs from the forests -
- Dwarfs from the rocks
dwarfs from the forests -
- get what saw-mill going
our axes whacking.
- Get what saw-mill going
our axes whacking.
With a hip and a hop
the forest sprite is at work.
With a hip and a hop
he gets it all done.
With a hip and a hop
they know all the crafts.
With a hip and a hop
the tinker is a master.
The tiler knows his job
the roof'll be a treasure
to save us from all weathers.
Now hold on to your hats!
Put on your helmets!
Gunpowder and shot will make things hot.
Hide!
Run!
Quickly!
Quickly!
Get going, before it goes off!
Quick!
Quick!
Hooray!
Hooray!...
With a hip and a hey
and a good loud hooray.
With a hip and a hey
the roof will be done.
Task fulfilled, Knight Brtnik!
Thank you, dwarfs and forest sprites.
And so as to make you remember us,
watch out now:
There,
and take this as a memento.
- Hooray!
Thank you!
Come here, Dopey!
Whoever did the job, it's a fact that
the roof is done.
You yourself said it, right at this
table, Jouza, that if we could afford
a new roof, the children would get
the castle.
Did you say so or didn't you?
- Well yes, I did.
But now I'm saying that we should report
these goings on at the castle. There are
some mysterious forces at work there.
Now then, John...
- It is mysterious,
but I'm not in favour of scaring
these mysterious forces away.
While they're bent on making things
like roofs, I'd leave them alone.
The local fire station needs a new roof
too, you know.
If we talked...
to these ghosts...
Are they voting yet?
- No.
The chairman wants to get the knight to
join the local Improvements Project.
I study these thing very thoroughly.
Knight William Brtnik of Brtnik lived
in the fifteenth century,
he was widowed at a young age
and stayed alone with his daughter...
- Leontine.
- Leontine.
That means they are creatures
from some other world,
supernatural creatures
that don't really exist.
However, I saw them with my own eyes.
The apothecary thinks
these must have been
hallucinations, illusions I suffered
as the consequence of drugs
I take for my low blood-pressure.
- Look here, catch these mysterious
illusions and lock them up,
that's what I say.
- Calm down!
And now, let's vote.
Who is in favour of the castle belonging
to the children?
Sister-in-law, pay attention.
That's a mistake.
My sister-in-law here thinks we were
voting for the mushrooms, don't you?
And who's in favour of the mushrooms?
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!...
Hooray! Hooray!
We've won!
- Knock me down with a feather!
Hooray!
- Hoolay!
The Black Chronicle voted for us!
- Hooray! Hooray!...
Come and help me, boys.
Oh.
Look, he's walking all alone.
Adam, yardstick!
- Yeah.
- Hurry up, then.
Thanks.
- That's all right.
You here?
- I've been here for ages.
I'm sitting right next to you.
- Whereabouts?
So I don't push you over.
- Where the daisy's waving.
- I see.
- John,
what is it like being alive?
- What it's like?
Just normal.
You walk about...
and you breathe.
I'd be more interested to know
what it's like being immortal.
- I'm Ionely all the time.
I keep complaining to my shadow,
who'll ever hand me a daisy,
who'll warm my heart
that's covered in deep snow-drifts?
The rain washes the leaves
so they are clean
the swallow sings its song
because it's alive.
Strange thoughts and grief.
But what about me?
Strange thoughts and grief.
What about me?
What about poor me?
Why poor you?
- That's just why, because I'm Ionely.
- And listen, can't you do something
about not being seen before
the first bird of night flies out?
- We could.
Daddy would have to lend you
the Appearance Parchment.
Whoever reads it, can see us even in
broad daylight.
- There now, just look at that,
he's hot an Appearance Parchment
and he wouldn't lend it to us,
the greedy so-and-so!
- Who are you calling a breedy
so-and-so, you ginger fox?
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon to you all.
Here is the Appearance Parchment, see?
- Boys!
- Wait!
But I don't lend it to just anyone.
- You'll lend it to me,
won't you?
- You're my favourite.
Hand me that potion!
- If you hand over the parchment.
- You can borrow it.
But mind I get it back when
the repairwork's done.
- So!
- Hmm...
Te amice spiritus quaesumus audio nos
et statim appareas fiat.
It works!
- Now do you see?
- Yes.
- But I don't see anybody.
- You must stay in line behind
the person reading it.
Then you'll see him.
- I can see them now!
- Isn't she lovely!
- Here they are!
- And what a nice dress!
- Look!
- And a what a nice hair, right?
- And those eyes!
- I don't see a thing.
- You can't read, so that's
why you can't see them.
Sister-in-law, how could you
do this to me.
How could you?
- Read this!
- What?
A family of five...
- Go on...
...in Prague, Kobylisy,
ate a basket - full
...of poisonous mushrooms, thinking
they were champignons. And that's why
you voted against the mushroom project?
- And there's also an article
about bribes.
- And we did bribe them, Tony,
those workmen.
- But...
- In the village of Chuchvaly near Kolin
they found out about such a case
and took it to court.
- Chuchvaly near Kolin.
That's flat country, everybody sees
into everybody's back garden.
But we're in hilly country.
Sister-in-law, you and these
accident-columns of yours, they'll drive
you crazy one of these days.
D'you know what you've done?
I could have become a mushroom King.
- Don't be angry with me,
brother-in-law.
- But... It's too soon for tears.
You don't know Jouza.
Do you remember cousin Charles, the one
who came to Annie's wedding?
- Yes, that odd-Iooking chap.
- Odd but influential.
And do you remember what he said there
at that wedding?
My beloved family... I'll always do my
all for you.
- But it was in the small hours
he said that. He didn't know
what he was saying by then.
- I'm going to visit him.
- Wait!
- Right now!
He'll show them.
- But brother-in-law,
surely you're not going by car...?
- Some Hunters Liquor,
- You're under the influence of alcohol.
In case he likes it...
Stuffed mushrooms...
- In the community of Doksy a driver
Macha, was under influence of alcohol
whilst at the wheel and ended up in
Macha lake.
Sleep!
That's only a private car.
Good morning.
What can I do for you?
- A driving wheel.
Just what I wanted.
And you mind your own business.
- Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Come again.
Johnny...
- Yes?
- What sort of a family tree
do you have?
- Family tree?
I'm not a pedigree dog.
- I mean, what's your origin?
Your great-grandfather Long John, who
saved daddy's life,
was of humble origin.
- I come of decent family, my mother
works at the co-operative farm and dad
works at the Cultivation Centre.
- Cultivation?
- Yes. Last year they cultivated
some special grain, wheat it was,
and they were awarded an order.
- An order?
A Knight's Order?
- No,
the Order of Labour, I think.
- That's good.
- Look here,
one looks differently at the family
origin line nowadays.
But I doubt
you'd understand.
So your honoured father is a nobleman.
- He's noble all right,
but more often he's just a man.
Anyway, why would you care?
If I were you I'd concentrate on being
more like us.
Go to school and so on.
Such a pretty girls and she play ghosts
all night...
- Such a pretty girl you said?
Sure thing.
- The lime.
The lime.
Boys, come on, start unloading.
Mr. Brtnik!
Mr. Brtnik, the headmaster
sends a message,
he's asking you out for a beer tonight.
- For a beer?
Hmm...
In that case I'll wear my best boots.
I'll tell you how it's done.
Nowadays a boy just asks a girl
if she wants to, and they get married.
- He doesn't have to fight
for her at all?
Fight his rival to the death?
- No.
Except that they sometime have a fight
at a pub.
- And do they fight with?
Spears or swords?
- Chairs, mostly.
- I see.
Leave the tiles, get the bricks first!
Leave the bags.
And how does a young man let his beloved
know that his heart is on fire?
- How?
You know, never fear.
He keeps staring at you and then he says
can he carry your bag for you.
- Your bag, you say?
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
- See that bag?
- I see it.
He doesn't love me.
- No this sort of bag.
I meant your school-bag, see?
- My satchel?
- That's right your satchel.
Listen, everybody!
Your as slow at your work as snails.
This way we wouldn't get done
by Christmas.
I'll choose a spell to get us forwards
a hundred years.
Stand back and watch.
Bricklayer sprites, awake.
- Awake, Bricklayer sprites.
- Take up your tools.
- Take up your tools.
- The sand is red, the lime is white.
- The sand is red, the lime is white.
- The ruined doorway back to rights.
- The ruined doorway back to rights.
Stop it!
Stop it!
What's the good, you'll just get your
sprites and dwarfs to do the job for us.
- And why not?
Why?
It'll get done quickly
and save you the bother.
- We wouldn't enjoy it.
We wanted to repair the tower ourselves.
We were looking forward
to the project so.
- Sure.
Thanks a lot, sprites and dwarf,
but we'll finish the job ourselves now.
- Sure.
It was awtully good of you but we don't
need you any more.
- That's right, thanks a lot, but run!
Move!
- See you.
Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Bye.
- But now run!
I'm not a dwarf.
- And who shall make out the difference?
How should I have known? How?
Come along, Little one.
Come on!
I didn't get there, sister-in-law.
And I sort of scratched the car
a bit against a house.
- There now, see?
- Damn it,
where did you get it?
- The dwarfs?
- Yes.
- Just imagine, the children
gave it to me.
- What?
Gave it to you?
- Yes.
Because I voted in their favour.
- That's nice.
Very pretty.
Nice pieces.
Gipsum.
Damn it!
- Tony,
just imagine, the castle's to be
handed over to the children on Sunday.
Well, nothing can be done about it.
There'll be all sorts of toffs
here to watch.
It'll be a fantastic do.
- Listen, sister-in-law, now I'm
in the position
of not having wished the youngsters
well.
- Well, some people could see
it that way.
You know what, go and tell the chairman
that I want to hold a speech. And we'll
make a little business on the side,
selling those dwarfs there.
- How do you mean?
- There'll be foreigners there for sure.
And they'll just fall for them.
Look, isn't it great?
It'll be a good bit of business,
you wait. To our Pioneers,
our young people.
Just look at our beautiful castle...
Remember the state it was in a year ago,
and look at it today.
And I'm asking myself:
Whose is the merit?
Who was it who
worked so hard and who...
...spent.
- Do something to him, Leontina.
- What?
- Whatever you like.
- All right.
- And I'll tell you something else
when I... when I... when I...
when I... when I... when I...
- Excuse me.
...when I came
and saw all this wonder,
I said to myself:
This is unbelievable.
How could those children have managed
all this?
And believe me,
dear friends,
it gives me such a wonderful feeling.
A feeling of great pride.
I'm really proud of them! But let us
come down to earth, my friends.
These children
managed to rebuild
the pride and joy of our village,
of the whole region from ruins,
absolute ruin!
An interesting speech.
- They started with a show,
and that's quite a funny number, what?
Leontina, couldn't you arrange for him
to have clouds
of dust coming out of his mouth?
...would they be as well nourished
- Leontina...
- if our grocery store were not so well
stocked?
- Where are you? Right now...
Where are you?
Moreover, I would recommend
your worthy notice
to this here stand with these charming,
cute and artistically made dwarfs.
Please come and look at them.
Fantastic!
And each of these dwarfs
has his own little spade,
all this being a true work of art.
And their price?
A mere three hundred crowns each.
- That's overdoing our price, friends,
let's go!
- They're tasteful,
washable,
coloured and... they're gone.
Why did you run away? The Appearance
Parchment is about to be read,
so that everybody sees you.
- Oh, John.
My dear John...
I feel nothing but disgust.
The creature I hit over the head
because he wanted to plant mushrooms
in my bedroom
is ittering wasteful words
of stupid pride.
- Never mind, let him go on uttering.
- And I also said to myself, John,
if we become visible the whole castle
would become a fair-groung attraction.
We wouldn't have a moment's peace, ever.
Give me back my Appearance Parchment!
- Does it mean,
we won't see you any more?
- I feel sorry, too.
But... it'll be better this way.
My daughter feels ill from that all.
Come on!
- Not even at the dusk?
- Daddy doesn't want to.
Give me back my Appearance Parchment.
Leontina!
Leontina!
Leontina! Wait for me!
Leontina! Leontina! Leontina!
Where are you?
- Leave that flower alone, Leontina,
you know what fate would strike you!
I'd hoped
you wouldn't find out.
- What?
- That I'd come alive
if a live person hands me a daisy.
- You're alive?
- Boor.
- You mean,, sure".
That's right,
you aren't cold any more.
I think you have a temperature of
thirty-seven centigrade like we do.
- You are a mortal now.
- But I am alive!
Forgive me, daddy, for having left you,
but I had to. I'll bring your beer
up here for every evening.
The day is full of sunlight
the day is full of sunlight.
The night has fluttering feathers
from the raven's wing
Time flies like the wind,
time flies like the wind.
L'm growing up to be a Miss.
You're growing up to be a Miss.
Maybe l'll even be a woman some day.
And we'll soon be of age.
And we'll soon be of age.
We'll wait
we'll wait
we'll wait for each other.
Time flies like the wind,
time flies like the wind.
No longer are our hearts frozen,
no longer are our hearts frozen.
We'll some time.
And will be grown
And will be grown
we'll soon be of age. - You and me.
