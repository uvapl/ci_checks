Tommy, hurry up!
You're gonna be late for school again.
Son of a...
Damn!
Nice doggy.
Holy schnikes!
Late again, Tommy?
- You're pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard.
- Come on, Tommy!
- Hurry up.
Damn!
Hi. How are you?
Oh, man!
No! Please, God, no!
Son of a...
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Hey, I got an A.
Sorry. Pardon me.
Can I just check this out?
"D+"?
Oh, my God.
I passed!
I passed.
Man! I got a D+.
I'm gonna graduate!
I wish we'd known each other.
This is a little awkward.
I'm gonna graduate! Give me five!
I'm gonna graduate!
Wombat!
Guys, do I look different
now that I'm a college grad?
Not really.
Apparently, they give a lot fewer
D pluses than D minuses.
It's not a grade they like to give out,
I'll tell you that right now.
- Yeah. You mentioned that.
- So that's it for school, huh? Now what?
No idea.
But for now I'll probably go back
and work at my dad's
loading dock like always.
Then after that, figure it out.
I'm gonna miss you, man.
You were the best.
You were the best. I love all you guys.
Especially you.
I'm gonna make a toast.
To the best bunch of rugby freaks
ever born.
Maybe we weren't the smartest guys
on campus.
Maybe we spent a little too much time
puking off balconies.
But we had fun, huh?
Yeah!
Now some of us are leaving
and that is sad.
But this isn't the end. No way.
We're gonna show this world
a thing or two.
We're gonna show...
- Richard Hayden?
- Tommy.
So where's my dad? I thought
he was gonna meet me at the airport.
He was at the airport this morning,
but you weren't on the plane.
He said he had a surprise for me.
Maybe. I guess you should've called.
I did call earlier when
using the phone.
- Earlier, when was that?
- Or later. When...
Then I left a message.
A message? What number did you call?
Two, four, niner,
five, six, seven, eight...
I can't hear you. You're trailing off.
And did I catch a "niner" in there?
Were you calling from a walkie-talkie?
- No, it was cordless.
- You know what? Don't.
Not here, not now.
Did you hear I finally graduated?
Yeah. In just a shade
under a decade, too. All right.
You know, a lot of people
go to college for seven years.
I know. They're called doctors.
That has to be you.
Spray that thing for bugs?
- What happened to the tire plant?
- Shut it down last month.
Would you mind not eating in the car?
It's kind of a rule.
- Still got your GTX car, huh?
- Yep.
And I dropped in a 440 Magnum
with a six-pack.
You hang on to a car this cherry
- kind of like your suitcase.
- "Kind of like your suitcase."
What's new with the old gang
from high school?
I don't know, Tommy. I didn't really like
the old gang from high school.
- Hey, the muffler plant's gone, too.
- Yep.
Man!
Come on! Damn it!
That sounds good.
Melted chocolate inside the dash.
That really ups the resale value.
I think you're gonna be okay here.
They have a thin candy shell.
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
I think your brain
has a thick candy shell.
Your... Your brain has the shell on it.
- Are you talking?
- Shut up, Richard.
Ron, don't tell me the bank thinks
we need to wait it out.
Any business that tries to wait it out
will be just that, out.
In auto parts you're either growing
or you're dying.
There ain't no third direction.
Tom, you're talking about a huge loan.
Maybe instead of borrowing
you should take on a partner.
No, this always has been,
always will be a family firm.
My grandfather founded it in '21.
My father kept it running during
the Depression. My aunt Aileen ran it
when he went away to war
and someday my son will run it.
- Hi, Dad.
- Tommy!
Damn, I'm proud of you. Mr. Big Time.
College grad.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.
You're looking great, kid.
Thanks, Mr. Rittenhauer.
How you doing, Mr. Reilly?
Real good.
I had a kidney removed last April
but I still have the other one.
Yeah, you remember Mr. Gilmore
from the bank.
- Yeah. Nice to see you again, sir.
- How are you?
Why don't you come out on the floor
with us?
Gilmore needs reminding
of why he does business with us.
- Richard, could you...
- Run these figures by accounting.
No problem.
My fellow nerds and I will retire
to the nerdery with our calculators.
- Come on.
- We should have something for you
by this afternoon.
Hard hats, gentlemen.
You get hit in the head
without wearing one of these
they scoop your brains out
with a goddamn soup ladle.
Look alive! Low bridge!
Son of a...
- You all right, Tommy?
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
Danny. How's that new son-in-law?
He's a real pain in the butt.
Tommy, you're back!
Way to go on that D+.
Thanks, Danny. Looking good, man.
- Hey, Tommy!
- Hey, man. How you doing?
How are you?
Good to see you. How you doing?
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey, Tommy.
- Welcome home, buddy.
- Tommy, welcome back.
Hang in there, Ron. We're almost there.
Lou, I got some papers
I want you to sign in the office.
- Hey, Louis.
- Hey, Tommy!
What are you doing on the floor?
I was going crazy on the loading docks,
so your dad moved me in here.
- What is this thing?
- It's a buffer.
I take oil filters that need smoothing
and give them a quick zap.
Cool.
- Can I try one?
- Help yourself.
Nice distance.
Tommy! Come on! Let's go!
Yes, sir! See you.
There she is, Ron, my dream.
This, my friend,
is our new brake-pad division
and the future of Callahan Auto.
- Quite a sight, Tom.
- This is awesome.
You say these brake pads
are gonna revolutionize the industry?
Composed of high-grade steel
and graphite.
They're the goddamn Rolls-Royce
of brake pads, that's what they are.
I get tears in my eyes
just thinking about it.
You're coming awful fast.
- How you doing?
- I need fresh capital for material
for a new work force,
before I can turn these machines on.
Look out.
I've got catlike speed and reflexes.
Now, in 23 years,
have I ever said no to you?
Why say no when it feels so good
to say yes?
I was checking
the specs on the end line
for the rotary girder.
I'm retarded.
- Okay, Tom. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, left.
Can I open my eyes now, Dad?
I told you, you didn't have to close them
in the first place.
Here, go ahead. Open them up.
That's my name!
That's your new office now,
college grad.
Go on in there!
Awesome. Hey, there's even a fridge.
This is great.
You could put six-packs of
soda in here. Milk, yogurt.
You could put candy bars in the freezer.
Anything that you want to keep cool.
Mr. Callahan,
I need your John Hancock
on these reports.
John Hancock. It's Herbie Hancock.
Richard, check out my new office.
You have a window.
And why shouldn't you?
You've been here ten minutes.
Now look, Son,
these are our new catalogs.
Get to know them. They're important.
Richard, I want you to promise me
you'll look after Tommy Boy here
till he gets his feet wet.
Sure. And thanks for choosing me.
Now don't forget,
we're going home early today.
- I got another surprise for you.
- Cool.
Thanks, Dad.
It's called reading.
Top to bottom, left to right.
Group of words together is a sentence.
Take Tylenol for any headaches.
Midol for any cramps.
Shut up.
Can I open my eyes now, Dad?
For God's sake, Son,
will you quit covering your damn eyes?
Holy schnikes.
- Is that for me?
- No, Son, that's for me.
Oh, man!
Dad, she's like a 10.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- This must be Tommy. Are you Tommy?
- I'm Tommy.
- I'm Beverly and you are just adorable.
Son, I got an announcement to make.
Tom, I've asked Beverly to be my wife.
Man!
What'd she say?
It's so cool that
you're getting married Saturday.
- So where'd you guys meet?
- Here you go, sweetie.
We met at that fat farm spa resort thing.
Beverly was one of the trainers.
In fact, she was the only one
of the trainers I didn't want to plant
six feet under a lettuce patch.
Wait till you hear this, Tommy.
She's got a son.
He worked at the spa, too.
I met him. He's a terrific guy.
You're really gonna like him.
He's coming here today for the wedding.
Tommy, it sounds funny saying this
but my son is going to be
your new brother.
Brother? I'm gonna have a brother?
I've always dreamed
about having a brother.
- Speak of the devil.
- A brother!
- Brother?
- I'm Paul.
- You must be Tommy.
- Brothers don't shake hands.
Brothers gotta hug.
I can't believe
I have a whole new family.
This is awesome.
- Yeah. Great.
- No offense
but if I sent a picture of your mom
to some of my buddies at school
she'd definitely be Boner of the Month.
I'm honored.
So is there anything to do
in this town besides eat?
Tons of stuff. Late night pitch 'n' putt.
We could go to the livestock auction
and cruise the Four-H babes.
Throw stuff off the bridge.
What do you feel like doing?
I don't know.
Something a little more dangerous.
Sure. All you can handle, bro.
Look at them there.
Pretty maids all in a row.
I want the one on the left.
She's perfect. Which one you want?
Okay.
- Does it make a difference?
- Oh, yeah.
Wait a second. Is this your first time?
Yeah, Tommy, it is.
God, you're gonna remember this
the rest of your life.
I can't believe you've never been
cow-tipping before. Get ready to live.
She's sleeping.
What you do is you put your shoulder
into her and you push.
- And?
- They fall over.
This doesn't strike you as kind of dumb?
We're family.
We're gonna be doing
lots of dumb stuff together.
Wait till Christmas.
You keep your feet
shoulder-width apart.
Stay between the udder and the hock.
It's a 32 belly option.
On two, on two. Ready. Hut!
Son of a...
Holy schnikes!
Hey, get off my property!
Run for it!
- I'll save you, brother!
- I'm okay.
- Get away from me!
- Get up!
- I can walk.
- I love you.
Hey, get me. My turn. Over here.
These shoes are Italian.
They're worth more than your life.
Man, did I get douched with mud!
Chucko, that doesn't smell like mud.
Man, that's cold.
I'm a maniac
Maniac on the floor
And I'm dancing like
I've never danced before
Did you eat a lot of paint chips
when you were a kid?
Why?
- Good morning, Richard.
- Hi.
Luke, I am your father.
I've interrupted Happy Time.
Look, your father wants you
to check out the delay problems
we're having at the loading dock.
I know you'd love to just sit there
and keep being not slim.
But we gotta work a little today, okay?
- That was from Star Wars.
- I know.
R.T., I think I figured out the problem.
This order's going to Columbus.
That's a one-day delivery
but you've got it marked down for two.
That's because it's going to Columbus,
Georgia, not Columbus, Ohio.
You see these letters by the city?
That's called a state.
What else you got, Wonder Boy?
That's pretty much it for now.
Tommy, maybe you should go back
to college for another seven years
and study a globe.
Tommy Callahan?
Michelle Brock. Chaparrall High.
Remember?
Yeah, I remember.
I sat next to you in History.
You work here?
It's so bizarre that you work here.
Come on in. And forget about R.T.
He's just pissed off 'cause
he recently found out what a loser he is.
What a loser he is.
Hey, nice.
How come you don't put the files
in the file cabinets?
- I don't like file cabinets.
- Why not?
You have to open them.
I've got my own system.
Hasn't failed me yet.
All the shipping orders go through me.
Which means I spend about half
of my pathetically anal life in here.
If I couldn't do things my own way
I'd probably freak out
and blow up the whole town.
Cool.
Remember your brother Duane?
What ever happened to him?
We used to go to Safeway all the time
and get caught trying to steal donuts.
He's a cop.
He had to get a real job when
my parents moved to Cuyahoga Falls.
- Want one?
- I'd better not.
I have what doctors call
a little bit of a weight problem.
I used to grab bear claws as a kid,
two at a time.
And I'd get them lodged
right in this region here.
- How about some coffee?
- I'd love some.
Man, I bet half the town's here.
You look great, Dad.
You look good, too, Tommy Boy.
Listen, Tommy, this marriage thing,
I know it's a big step.
But, you know,
ever since your mom died...
Look, Tommy, something about
getting old and being alone...
You know, something...
Dad, it's cool, you know?
I just want you to be happy.
Yeah, I know you do. And I am, kid.
I am happy, Tommy Boy.
- They're ready for you, sir.
- Good! Well, we're ready, too.
- So, how do we look?
- Chubby?
I think that's the champagne talking.
And so these vows are held sacred
from now until eternity.
If there's any person who finds a reason
these two should not be wed
speak now or forever hold your peace.
- You kidding? Go get them, Tom!
- Yeah.
Now, by the power vested in me
by the State of Ohio
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
- Guys.
- Now look.
Say something to the bride and groom.
Hey, Dad and Beverly.
This is Michelle Brock,
the prettiest gal in Sandusky.
Michelle, say a little something
into the camera.
A little something into the camera.
It sounds good, Tom,
but I'd like to take a look at
your operation before I commit.
Fair enough, Doug.
'Course I could get a good look
at a T-bone steak
by sticking my head up a bull's ass
but I'd rather take
the butcher's word for it.
Bull's ass, that's great.
And you guarantee everything you sell?
You know,
I could guarantee you all day long.
But we both know a guarantee is only
as good as the man who writes it.
It sounds good, Tom.
- I'll send the contract next week.
- All right, good man.
- You're still the best, Tom.
- Eight whiskey sours,
I still sell the son of a bitch.
Damn! I'm good.
I just want to tell you,
you really look dynamite today, Beverly.
Yeah, Tom, you are a lucky man.
Boy, would I like to get some of that!
- Good Lord.
- Oh, God, no.
Listen, Richard,
you got an edit button on that thing?
- It'll cost you.
- Come here, you little prick.
All right. Hold it a second, folks.
Wait a minute.
Yeah, it's working now.
Listen, I want to thank you all
for coming today
to welcome two new Callahans
to the family
my beautiful wife, Beverly,
and my new son, Paul.
I feel like the luckiest man
in the world today.
- Hit it!
- Three, four.
But right now I'm gonna need you,
Tommy Boy
to get this place going.
- But me, Dad?
- Yeah, you, Tommy Boy.
- Get up.
- Dad, I really don't think... Okay.
First rocker, take it, Tommy Boy!
Hey, mama,
don't you treat me wrong
Come and love me,
baby, all night long
Testify, Tommy boy. Testify.
Whoa, all right, now
Tell me what I say
- Second rocker, me!
- Hit it.
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows
how to twist that thing, oh, oh
That's right, Dad.
Hey, hey
Come on now, Dad.
All right, now
Tell me what I say
What did I say
Hit the "heys" and the "hos."
Hey
Ho
- Hey
- Hey
- Ho
- Ho
- Hey, Ho
- Hey, Ho
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, Dad, come on now!
Hear what I say
Yeah, what I say
Come on now!
- Dad?
- Somebody call 911.
There's not much more we can say,
really.
We've lost someone we love
and it hurts.
Even though Tom is gone,
he'll remain in our lives forever
comforting us, making us laugh
and watching over us.
My dad gave me this boat.
We'd come out here late at night when
there was no one else on the lake
and then he'd be over there
on the shore
and he'd yell,
"Quit playing with your dinghy!"
I'm gonna really miss him.
- Your father was a great guy.
- Yeah.
I'm really glad you brought me out here.
I can't believe you wanted to.
Although it's pretty fun,
if we had some wind.
I can't believe there's no wind.
You need wind 'cause it...
- Helps push the sail.
- Yeah.
So what are you gonna go do now?
I don't know. But I gotta do something.
And I don't know what.
- Man, do I sound like an idiot.
- No.
Sorry about this wind.
I can't believe there isn't
any wind out here.
This is ridiculous.
No, it's great.
It's very peaceful.
Hey, Tubbo, you ain't moving!
Yeah. Need a little wind here.
No, you need to drop
a couple hundred pounds, blimp!
Rascals.
I guess that's your theory.
So we'll see what happens tomorrow.
Your sail is limp, like your dick!
Watch your language
in front of the lady, punk!
Jeez.
You were saying?
Hey, Gilligan, did you eat the Skipper?
You better pray
to the god of skinny punks
that this wind doesn't pick up
because I'll come over there
and jam an oar up your ass!
Jeepers creepers.
Those guys keep interrupting us.
I'm sorry about that.
- You were saying about the...
- Hey, lady, look out!
- There's a fat whale on your boat!
- Yeah. Free Willy!
Listen up, you little spazoids.
I know where you live
and I've seen where you sleep.
I swear to everything holy
that your mothers will cry
when they see what I've done to you!
I was just kidding.
I have no idea where they live.
That was awesome.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're in real trouble.
Zalinsky Industries has an offer
on the table to buy us out.
But as you realize,
Callahan has been family-owned
since Tommy's great-grandfather
laid the first brick.
And I'll be damned
if that's gonna change on my watch.
If we sell while our value's still high
everyone who owns stock
in this company
stands to make a lot of money.
That, of course, includes you,
Mrs. Callahan
now that you and Tommy
are the primary shareholders.
It seems vulgar to think about money
at a time like this.
I don't want to hear the word
"sell" again.
But, Ron, we do need that loan to
keep us afloat until we figure things out.
I'm sorry, Frank. We can't do it.
Tom got in way over his head
when he built the brake-pad division.
The bank just can't take a chance
on putting up any more money.
Now, let's face it. When Big Tom died,
Callahan Auto may have died with him.
If this factory goes under,
the whole town goes under.
And that's when the whores come in.
- Here we go.
- Excuse me. What was that?
Men laying their trick money down,
$20 to pay the rent.
Maybe, instead,
I'll spend it on the whore.
Frank, I really don't think
we have any choice.
Maybe I can help.
I'll give you everything I've got.
My house, the stock.
If I give you that stuff as collateral,
then will you give us that loan?
Well, yes, I suppose so.
Wait a second.
What are you saying, Tommy?
You just wanna hand over
your inheritance?
Right.
If it'll help get the brake pads going.
My dad said the new pads
were the future of Callahan.
But who's going to sell them?
- I will. I'll go on my dad's sales trip.
- I'll be damned.
Whores running around doing
their little behind-shake for the menfolk.
- I kind of like her idea.
- For Christ's sake!
Once during the war,
I visited a prostitute.
And my life has been
a living hell ever since.
Now, hold on a minute.
Do we really want to put the future
of the company in Tommy's hands?
We're running low on options here, Ted.
I can hold off Zalinsky
for a couple of weeks.
- What have we got to lose?
- How about the jobs of 300 people?
No offense, Tommy, but you don't know
the first thing about brake pads.
I know I'm probably not the answer
you guys are looking for.
But I feel like I gotta do something.
You're right.
I don't know much about this stuff.
- But he does.
- Oh, no.
That's right. Richard knows more
about brake pads than anyone in here.
And since you were
my dad's right-hand man
I'd say you have the rest of the year
pretty much wide-open.
Time out. Bad idea.
I don't think anyone could help
Baby Huey out there on the road.
Do you have a better suggestion?
I can actually hear you getting fatter.
What did I say
about eating in the car, anyway?
That it's not good,
'cause it spoils your dinner?
Tommy, this is not a vacation for me.
I'm out here against my will.
So the least you can do is pretend
to work. Okay? Now, let's review.
Okay, you're right. Review time.
Let's do it up. Feed me.
First, what are the three grades
of Callahan brake pads?
Personal, commercial,
and agricultural.
And what is our carrying charge for
all the merchandise in the warehouse?
Oh, man!
- One and a half...
- Half percent.
- I knew that. Why can't I remember it?
- Try an association like...
Let's say, the average person
uses 10 percent of their brain.
How much do you use?
One-and-a-half percent.
The rest is clogged with malted hops
and bong resin.
I gotta do this.
This has gotta be the one.
I've gotta do this.
It's gotta be me. It's gotta...
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Sorry. I'm ready.
- Hey, does this suit make me look fat?
- No, your face does.
Okay, let's check you out. All right.
- It's a clip-on.
- Are you sure?
All right. Now, it's sale time.
- So remember, we don't take no...
- No shit from anyone!
- No.
- We don't take no prisoners.
We don't take no for an answer.
Oh, yeah.
We don't take no for an answer.
We don't take no for an answer.
We don't take no for an answer.
- No.
- Okey-dokey.
- No.
- Gotcha! Thanks.
Terrific. Thanks for your time.
Let me say
maybe.
Well, then, I'd just like to add
that the spectrometer readout
on the nickel-cadmium alloy mix
indicates a good rich strobe and fade.
Decreasing incidence of wear
to the pressure plate.
Whoa, little fella,
you're not speaking my language.
What my associate
is trying to say is that
our new brake pads are really cool.
You're not even gonna believe it.
Like, let's say you're driving
along the road with your family
and you're driving along.
Then, all of a sudden, there's a
truck tire in the middle of the road
and you hit the brakes.
Whoa. That was close.
Now, let's see what happens
when you're driving
with the "other guy's" brake pads.
You're driving along, all of a sudden
the kids are yelling from the back seat.
"I gotta go to the bathroom, Daddy."
"Not now, damn it!"
Truck tire.
"I can't stop!"
Help!
There's a cliff.
And your family's screaming:
"Oh, my God! We're burning alive!
"No, I can't feel my legs!"
In comes the meat wagon.
And the medic gets out and says,
"Oh, my God."
New guy's in the corner
puking his guts out.
All because you want to save
a couple extra pennies.
- To me, it doesn't...
- Get out.
- Now.
- Yes, sir.
- Do you validate?
- Now!
Okay. Thank you.
- She's a quart low.
- Oh, yeah?
Then guess what?
Open it back up and put it in.
That's your penance
for the puppet show back there.
And while you're at it,
fill it up with gas, okay?
I'm gonna go ask directions
to our next huge, embarrassing failure.
You're a huge, embarrassing failure.
- What?
- Nothing.
Chief, could you tell me
how far it is to Davenport?
22 miles.
- Okay. I can't find it on this map.
- Well, get yourself a new map.
Son of a...
For Pete...
Well, it's gotta be on the map.
Davenport, I mean,
because you say it's 22 miles away.
And you're really smart.
Yet it's not on the map.
I'm picking up your sarcasm.
I should hope so,
because I'm laying it on pretty thick.
That's a map of Illinois, which we're in
on the border of lowa,
which is where Davenport is
22 miles away.
You're in the wrong state.
Get yourself a new map.
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Okay. How much do I owe you for gas?
- He didn't pump any.
- What?
Why didn't you pump any gas?
They're all out. They only got diesel.
Better go to the next station.
What'd you do?
I'd just like to welcome you all
to our annual Callahan Employee Night.
I know it doesn't quite feel the same
without Big Tom here.
But we're still a family.
So let's try and have some fun.
Hey, Mr. Rittenhauer,
is it true Tommy's on the road
trying to save this place?
Tom's out there filling in for his dad
until we get things settled here.
Are you kidding? We're all screwed.
That kid's one apple
that fell way off the tree.
Mommy, I want a Popsicle.
"Mommy, I want a Popsicle."
That hurt.
You want to act like a baby,
I'll treat you like one.
Now, if you want to act like a big boy...
- Bad Mommy.
- Don't call me that. It's creepy.
Come on, this is working out better
than we planned.
I thought it'd take a year
to bleed him dry in a divorce settlement.
Instead, the guy croaks
and you own half the company.
But it's too bad he didn't
leave me any cash.
You talk to the banker?
Yeah. Unfortunately your stock
isn't worth dick
until they sell the place.
That moment is rapidly approaching.
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi.
Mr. Rittenhauer,
is Tommy, you know, doing okay?
Well, sometimes it takes a little time
for a salesman to find his style.
- You think he's finding one?
- I hope so.
Hold on right there, honey.
- I'll see you, Michelle.
- Okay. See you.
I'm telling you, Paul, the only thing
keeping us poor is Tommy.
The guy's an idiot.
He won't sell squat.
This is what I think of Callahan.
Tommy save the factory. That's a laugh.
I don't see any McKeesport.
It's the next town, Tons of Fun.
It's gotta be there.
Okay, where's Moron?
Okay, Moron's here, so McKeesport...
Yeah, look, Magellan,
we're at this wrinkle here.
Deer!
You saw what happened.
There was nothing I could do, right?
Maybe if you didn't lean over to
insult me, you would've seen it coming.
Shut up, Tommy. It's not my fault.
- Poor little furry thing.
- I've never seen one close up before.
What are we gonna do?
We can't just leave it here.
Oh, no,
loading it up took us over an hour.
Now we only got 20 minutes
before Brady Automotive closes.
- Where are we gonna take the deer?
- I don't know, the vet?
- You take dead animals to the vet?
- Why not? I'd take you to the vet.
Yeah, I'll take you to the...
- Got that?
- Shut up.
He's just down the hall, sir,
last door on the left.
Thank you.
What's your hurry?
You know that thing in the back seat?
It's not an air freshener.
It's a dead, rotting deer carcass.
We gotta take care of it quick.
This is one of our oldest customers,
so we should be in and out.
This sales thing isn't so easy.
You can't just go in and out.
You gotta finesse them a little bit.
By finesse do you mean
sputtering out sentence fragments
and lighting things on fire?
No. But it's nice to see you again,
Mr. Insult.
Say, have you seen Richard anywhere?
Because if you do, could you ask him
I mean since he's so good,
if he might want to try selling?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Watch and learn.
Of course I understand what no means.
But if I took no for an answer
I'd wind up on a street corner
selling spicy hot dogs
and wearing a funny hat, right?
It makes sense, doesn't it?
Look, I've been doing business with
Callahan since I hung out my shingle.
But I don't like you.
Probably never will.
You're a smug, unhappy little man.
And you treat people
like they were idiots.
Mr. Brady, you and my dad go way back.
Son, I was sorry to hear
about your dad. I was.
But before I decide
to keep my business
with your place, I'd have to come by
and have a look at your new operation.
I'll tell you what, you can take
a good look at a butcher's ass
by sticking your head up there, but
wouldn't you rather take his word for it?
What?
I'm failing to make
the connection here, son.
No. I mean
you can get a good look at a T-bone by
sticking your head up a butcher's ass.
- But then... No. It's gotta be your bull.
- Wow.
Here's the deal. If I want you...
- You have derailed.
- Shut up, Richard.
Boy, I'm really at a loss for words here.
Forget it, I quit.
I can't do this anymore, man.
My head's about to explode.
My whole life sucks.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know where I'm going.
My dad just died. We just killed Bambi.
I'm out here getting my ass kicked
and every time I drive down the road
I want to jerk the wheel
into a goddamn bridge abutment!
I can't...
We'll be in touch.
- That guy might not call us.
- I can't believe he called me a psycho.
Were you in there just now?
You are a psycho. Good God.
And comb your hair.
Well,
I wouldn't say you did much better.
Thought you were so cool.
"Watch and learn," he says.
Well, I was watching. Know what I saw?
It's alive!
I think it tried to bite me!
Oh, man!
No way that just happened.
My car is completely destroyed.
I swear I've seen a lot of stuff in my life.
But that was
awesome!
But sorry about your car, man.
That sucks.
We'; I return to the Zalinsky Family
Theater after these messages.
Will you shut the window, Tom?
You're letting moths in.
No, it's hot in here.
- Would you please just...
- Look, it's him.
America, if you need starters,
spark plugs,
ball joints, gaskets, cam shafts,
U-joints or rocker arms,
anything that can be screwed or glued
to that car or truck of yours,
come see old Ray.
You want a guarantee?
I got a guarantee stamped on every box.
He's got really weird hair.
But more important is the guarantee
that I make to the American worker.
I want your truck to help you
get the job done.
I want your cruiser to get out there
safely, so you can clean up the streets.
And I want your kids to be safe
when you take them for a ride.
Thanks, Ray.
Thank you, son.
The name's Zalinsky. I make car parts
for the American working man
because that's what I am.
And that's who I care about.
Drive on down to Zalinsky's
The auto parts king!
He seems like a nice guy.
This is the guy trying to
buy the company
not to mention
put you out in the street
and all you can say is,
"He seems like a nice guy."
He does.
Hello.
Michelle! Wow!
I'm glad you called me back.
Yeah, things are going great.
I feel my first sale coming on real soon.
Yeah, he's here.
He's just going over
his car insurance forms.
Could we get any more moths in here?
What? Richard's vacuuming.
He's vacuuming.
I don't know, I guess he's clean.
Michelle, can I call you back
in a few minutes?
Thanks. I miss you. Bye.
You can't sleep with the window open.
And I'm gonna lay down
some other rules, too.
What are you so mad about?
Are you nuts? Do you even have to ask?
My car is destroyed.
We haven't made one sale.
Which means
we only have to sell about
a half a million brake pads
in the next 10 days.
Or else the factory's going under.
And the one guy that should care
about all this, you, doesn't.
You know what, Richard?
You don't know me
as good as you think you do.
I care about stuff.
I'm getting better at this sales thing.
I'm not, but I could if you help me.
Forget it. I got enough to do
without having to change your diapers.
Richard, is this your coat?
- Don't do it.
- Fat guy in a little coat.
Don't.
Fat guy in a little coat
- Take it off, dickhead. I'm serious.
- Richard, what's happening...
- Good tune, man.
- I don't think so.
Yeah. Here we go.
This song sucks.
- Talk about lame.
- Totally.
- You can change it if you want.
- I don't care. It's up to you.
- I can live with it if you can.
- Suit yourself.
Oh, God.
I was just thinking.
When we stopped for gas this morning,
I think it was you who put the oil in.
If you're saying I didn't put
the right kind in, you're wrong.
I used 10W-30.
Besides, motor oil would have nothing
to do with this accident.
True. But you can't latch the hood
too well if you don't take the can out
you no-selling waste of space.
I swear to God you're worthless.
I'm sorry about your car.
But don't call me worthless.
I'm trying my best.
- I'm not my dad.
- That's right. You're not your dad.
He could sell a ketchup Popsicle
to a woman in white gloves.
- Ketchup Popsicle?
- Yeah!
I learned everything I know from him.
I didn't have a father.
He looked out for me.
But you, he was your real dad
and you just took it for granted.
"I'm Big Tom's son. He'll fix everything,
so I'm allowed to be a moron."
That's it!
Get out! Get out of the car!
It's go time. You and me!
"Look, Mommy, the rhino's
getting too close to the car."
"Him too afraid to get out,
he just a little guy."
That's it, big boy. I'm gonna wail on you.
You're gonna regret
volunteering for this job, porky.
Hey, boys and girls, it's Papa Smurf!
You don't want none of me,
think it through.
Come on, give me your best shot.
I'll give you a free one. Let me have it.
That was it?
Come on, you can do better than that.
Can't you, Captain Limp Wrist?
Try again.
Everybody, is there a window open?
I feel a draft.
If I wanted a kiss,
I would have called your mother.
That was a good one.
Hey, Prehistoric Forest.
Richard, do I have a mark on my face?
It really hurts.
Nope, nothing.
I thought I hit you in the shoulder.
My shoulder doesn't hurt very much,
but my face does.
Right here.
Not here or here so much,
but right here.
Nope. Shipshape.
Waitress, could I get that
shrimp cocktail I saw in the glass case?
Yep.
And, you, what can I get...
- Jesus, what happened to your face?
- I knew it. See, Richard?
I'll have chicken wings.
Kitchen's closed until dinner.
We just got cold stuff and desserts.
Boy, some chicken wings
would really hit the spot.
You sure it's closed?
Let me check. Yep, it's closed.
Okay.
I'll just have a sugar packet or two.
- Hey, what's your name?
- Helen.
That's nice. You look like a Helen.
Helen, we're both in sales.
Let me tell you why
I suck as a salesman.
Let's say I go into some guy's office.
Let's say he's even remotely interested
in buying something.
Then I get all excited.
I'm like Jo Jo the Idiot Circus Boy
with a pretty new pet.
The pet is my possible sale.
My pretty little pet, I love you.
So I stroke it and I pet it
and I massage it.
I love it.
I love my little naughty pet.
You're naughty.
Then I take my naughty pet and I go...
I killed it!
I killed my sale!
That's when I blow it.
That's when people like us
have got to forge ahead, Helen.
Am I right?
God, you're sick.
Tell you what.
I'll go turn the fryers back on
and throw some wings in for you.
Thanks, Helen.
Tommy likey. Tommy want wingy.
Did that board to the head
knock something loose?
What are you talking about?
That 180 you just pulled
with the waitress.
- Why can't you sell like that?
- I was just having fun.
If we didn't get the wings, so what?
We still got that Meat Lover's pizza
in the trunk.
You got the wings 'cause you were
relaxed, so you had confidence.
And that's what it takes to sell,
confidence. Your dad had that.
Why do you always
have to de-turd these things?
- My dad was smart, I'm not.
- Very true.
But there's two types of smarts,
book smarts, which waved bye-bye
to you long ago
and there's street smart,
the ability to read people.
And you know how to do that
just like your dad.
He was the best at knowing
what people wanted to hear
and what people needed to hear.
That's what selling is all about.
In a way, these people are buying you,
not just brake pads.
Hey, everybody. It's Tony Robbins.
- Maybe you're right, Richard.
- I think I am.
Holy Lord, look at this guy. Caught him
right after Thanksgiving feast.
- Nice, Richard.
- God, I need a pooper-scooper.
I like your line. And I like your prices.
But there's a problem.
There's no guarantee on the box.
Heck, if something breaks down you can
call me, even if I'm home watching TV.
Callahan has guaranteed
every part sold since 1925.
Maybe so, but it's not on the box.
It should always be on the box,
comforting you, calling out:
"I'm good. I'll never let you down.
"But if I do,
I'm gonna make things all better."
Our brake pads are made
with a non-corrosive polyplated...
If you're not talking about a guarantee,
skip it.
My customers need to see that
little label looking them right in the eye.
You can get a good look
at your butcher...
- No.
- What?
- Remember, chicken wings.
- Chicken wings?
All right, you want to talk
about guarantees, then...
Fellows, you just ran out of time.
Chicken wings.
Let's think about this for a sec, Ted.
Why would somebody
put a guarantee on a box?
- Very interesting.
- Go on, I'm listening.
Here's the way I see it.
A guy puts a fancy guarantee on a box
because he wants you to feel all warm
and toasty inside.
- Yeah. Makes a man feel good.
- Of course it does. Why shouldn't it?
You figure you put that box
under your pillow at night
the Guarantee Fairy might come by
and leave a quarter, am I right, Ted?
What's your point?
The point is, how do you know
the fairy isn't a Krazy Glue sniffer?
"Build a model airplane," says the
little fairy. Well, we're not buying it.
He sneaks into your house once,
that's all it takes.
Next thing there's money missing off the
dresser, your daughter's knocked up.
I've seen it 100 times...
But why do they
put a guarantee on the box then?
Because they know all they sold you
was a guaranteed piece of shit.
That's all it is, isn't it?
If you want me to take a dump
in a box and mark it guaranteed, I will.
I got spare time.
But for now, for your customers' sake,
for your daughter's sake
you might want to think about
buying a quality product from me.
- Okay, I'll buy from you.
- Well, that's...
- What?
- What?
He's made one deal, Paul,
it's not the end of the world.
What would be good for us?
We want to sell the factory.
They're not gonna sell the factory
as long as Tommy keeps making sales.
Why don't you come to bed?
I got it! What does every factory need?
Trucks. They make stuff.
They've got to ship it, it's a must.
You see, it's all very simple really.
Stop the trucks, stop Tommy Boy.
God!
Not good.
Come on, man. Let's at least take five
minutes to celebrate our first victory.
Look, we got lucky, don't jinx it.
We only have a week left
before the loan's due.
I've gotta finish figuring out
our trip tonight so we can jam out early.
I'll tell you what.
You work out all the scientific stuff,
I'll go out and get a pizza.
The only thing I need to figure out
is whether to get Chicago style
or the thin crust.
The salesman has left the building.
See you in a little bit.
Oh, mamacita.
Hi.
Tommy, scram.
Don't give her the weight-room thing.
You know where the weight room is?
I'll check it out.
Sorry.
Idiot.
Daddy like.
You get wet, honey.
You deserve a swim.
Now take off that itchy robe.
Nobody is around. It's naughty time.
For the love of God, I've been patient.
Please don't stop.
We've been on the road...
Those are real.
No one's looking.
Speaking of no one's looking...
Bad girl.
Thank you.
I'm back.
Richard, what were you doing?
Going over some documents.
Where are they? Jeez, I don't see them.
They're in my briefcase.
- I thought you were getting pizza.
- They were closed.
How could you be reading documents
when they're in your briefcase?
That's a mystery.
Richard, were you watching
Spank-tro-Vision?
Okay, then, let's hit it.
Maybe you were watching a movie
with that funny comedian,
what's his name, Buddy Whack-it?
All right, then, let's get some shuteye.
- That's a pretty girl down there.
- Good for her.
Jeez, I wonder if she goes out
with one of the Yankees.
Couldn't tell you.
Big day tomorrow.
I hope we can keep
this momentum going.
Yep, that'd be good.
Richard?
Who's your favorite Little Rascal?
Alfalfa or is it Spanky?
Sinner.
Yes, I'll buy it.
Yes, I like what I hear.
Yes, sounds good.
By the way, did you ever eat paint chips
as a kid?
- Son of a...
- Jeez.
I'm okay.
A thousand units to Oshkosh?
Tommy, that's fabulous.
Your dad never sold 1,000 in Oshkosh.
Not since I've been here.
Lord, I've never had to tinkle so bad
in all of my life.
What the...
Richard, you're a riot!
Stop the car. Son of a...
What the hell's gotten into you?
My thing got stuck in my zipper,
I got piss all over my pants.
Okay, thanks. Bye. I owe you.
There you are.
While I was waiting,
I thought I'd make a couple of calls.
Okay, Mom.
I'll call you later then. Bye-bye.
- So what do you want?
- I just wanted to tell you
that Tommy's been
talking a lot about you recently.
And, well,
I thought you might want to know that.
God, he's so sweet.
You have no idea how much it means
having you and your mom as family.
- He says the sweetest things about her.
- Everything he does is sweet.
So when does sweetie get back?
This Friday, which is great
because we're backed up
on orders as it is.
He turned into this selling machine.
Well, between that and sweetness,
I'd say hang on to him.
I gotta go.
Yes, sir,
I can have that for you tomorrow.
Well, that would be great.
Thank you, sir.
Yes!
- Housekeeping.
- No, thank you. Sleeping.
- Housekeeping.
- Can you come back here in an hour?
- Housekeeping. You want towel?
- No towels, need sleepy.
Housekeeping, you want mint for pillow?
Please go away.
Let me sleep, for the love of God!
Housekeeping,
you want me jerk you off?
What kind of hotel is this?
- Oh, it's you.
- Good morning, sunshine.
Guess what? I just called Auto Tech
and they decided to make an order.
So, according to my calculations,
that puts us over the mark.
- We did it?
- We did it.
Yes! Richard, I'm so happy. Hold me.
- Yikes.
- Don't run away from your feelings.
Something went haywire
down at Shipping and Receiving.
Your shipments got screwed up
in the computer,
the wrong parts
went to the wrong cities.
Now all hell has broken loose.
I don't believe this.
Okay. So we call everyone
and explain what happened.
Half the orders have
already been canceled.
What?
They think it's an indication
of how things work around here.
The real problem is that we won't be
able to make the payment to the bank.
This is like a bad Twilight Zone.
I think I'm growing a tumor.
Look, we talk to the bank,
maybe they'll give us a break.
Hell, we've been doing business
with them for 23 years.
Tommy, it's all over.
You made a valiant effort,
but we're gonna have to sell to Zalinsky.
I'm flying to Chicago
to sign over the company.
- What's gonna happen to the factory?
- He's gonna shut it down.
Zalinsky doesn't care
about our workers.
He wants the Callahan name, that's all.
Did anyone see Scanners?
The bottom line is, by 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow we'll all be unemployed.
Don't say anything, okay?
I know I've ruined your entire life
and you hate me.
So let me just pack my things and I'll go
crawl into a dark hole for a few years.
Hi.
- So, do you hate me?
- I just don't get it.
I guaranteed overnight delivery.
I mean, we faxed you
our shipping addresses, didn't we?
Yes. And they were right when I
put them into my computer, I swear.
Then how could...
Man, this was so big!
I know it was big, but it wasn't my fault.
Why can't you put your files
in the file cabinets like everybody else?
Maybe if you weren't such a rebel
you could avoid...
Don't worry, because I've quit.
So you won't have to put up
with anything anymore.
Michelle, wait. Come on, please?
Thanks. Have a good flight.
May I help you?
I called about a ticket
to Cuyahoga Falls.
- The name's Brock.
- Right.
That flight's going through Columbus.
Let me just call that up for you.
Excuse me.
Come on.
Hello, is Detective Duane Brock
on duty today?
This town doesn't even know
what's about to hit it.
Fish in a barrel, my friend.
Town's the fish,
the people are the barrel.
Fish in a barrel.
What's wrong with you, Richard?
You can't drink in a car.
Don't you know
we can get busted for that?
I'm sorry. I did not know that.
But right now we got a bigger problem.
- That is?
- Beer's coming back up.
Oh, Lord!
Here we go.
Cops! Damn it, Richard.
The whole car smells like beer.
They're never gonna believe
I wasn't drinking.
- Hold on.
- What are you doing?
I've got an idea.
What the hell?
When I stop the car, run out screaming.
No problem.
Little trick my dad taught me.
Bees! Bees in the car!
Bees everywhere!
God, they're huge!
They're ripping my flesh off!
Son, roll around. Did you hear me?
Roll around on the ground.
Forget that. I'm starting to swell up!
Save yourself, Tommy!
Don't be the hero!
- Frank, I'm allergic to bees.
- Me, too.
They're huge and they're sting-crazy!
We'll come back later
and check on you.
Yeah, in a while.
Save yourself!
Your firearms are useless against them!
Holy schnikes, it worked.
I just barfed on an ant hill.
Cool. Whoa. I think they're pissed.
Yeah. That's the answer.
It doesn't look like the answer.
- I don't remember eating that.
- No! Zalinsky.
We'll go to Chicago,
tell him we're not for sale.
He seems like a good guy on TV.
He'll understand.
You are dreaming. You can't stop him.
You lost your shares to the bank,
remember?
What the hell! In less than 24 hours
I lose the factory anyway.
So why not give it a shot?
- Chicago?
- Chicago.
- You can't park here.
- Keep it.
Where are you going?
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.
Hi, Michelle, this is Tommy.
Listen, I'm sorry about what I said.
I was being an idiot.
I want to apologize
'cause I didn't mean it.
Anyway, Richard and I are going
to Chicago to straighten things out.
The next flight to Chicago
boards in five minutes
but I'm sorry, it's completely sold out.
I can put you on another one
at 3:00 this afternoon.
Lady, we really need to get to Chicago.
It's an emergency.
Is there anything you can do?
I can put you in at Salt Lake City
by 4:00. And there's another flight...
I don't have time to go
through another city.
I need a direct flight to Chicago.
I can reserve you a flight coming
back from Chicago at 5:55.
- Does that help?
- Hi, I'm Earth. Have we met?
I don't think so.
So I'll talk to you later? Okay, bye.
We're screwed. No tickets to Chicago.
Not even stand-by.
There's got to be something we can do.
Flight 481 for Chicago...
Wait a minute. You got any money?
'Cause I got a plan.
Yikes!
We're gonna get busted,
let's get out of here.
Too late. Hey, guess who's here?
What are we serving tonight,
chicken or chicken?
What a nice surprise, they said we
were gonna be short-handed this leg.
You two take coach.
Could you handle the announcements?
- Okey-dokey. No problemo.
- They're gonna know we're bogus.
Relax. You get on the horn.
I'll throw some peanuts at them.
We'll be in Chicago before you know it.
Okay, folks.
The guy in front of you is Tommy.
He'll be taking you
through my little spiel here.
Tommy is a Scorpio, he likes biking,
and he's never been laid.
Exits. Okay, there's one back here
and there's probably one
over by the wing somewhere. Usually.
And what about seat belts?
To fasten, take the little end
and stick it in the big end and...
Hey, know what?
If you don't know how to use
a seat belt, ring your call button
and Tommy will come hit you on
the head with a tack hammer
'cause you're a retard.
Okay, and life preservers.
These, we may need.
Although what are the odds of us
actually hitting a lake?
My money says if anything
it's gonna be a mountain.
To inflate, put it around your neck
and yank down on the tabs.
Damn!
Son of a...
I can't breathe!
I'm choking!
He's a big, dumb animal, isn't he, folks?
Folks, we're making our final approach
into Chicago.
Ma'am, you still alive?
Ma'am, there's a half-hour time limit.
¡Ay, caramba!
Okay, now, we're running out of time,
so you can't go see Zalinsky like that.
Now, go change.
Go.
Can you do your seat belt?
I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm fine now.
- What are you doing?
- I'm nervous, so I'm sweating.
You're gonna smell like a cab driver.
Not to say that that's bad.
I want to be fresh for the meeting.
- You look good. Are you ready?
- Ready or not, this is crunch time.
525, that's it.
Son of a... That's gonna leave a mark.
Look at this place.
Welcome to the pros.
No way! It's him!
There he is, my friend.
The King himself.
Let's do it. It's go time.
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.
You check the elevators.
I'll check the bank.
Where is he?
Listen up. This will only take a second.
Does anybody...
Jeez.
- What's going on out here?
- Walk slow.
- Okay. Why?
- Nothing.
- Am I consorting with a known felon?
- Shut up, Richard.
Hey, Mom,
it's the guy who robbed the bank.
- I didn't rob any bank.
- Yeah, right.
Like it was some other real fat guy
with a tiny head.
I got a tiny head?
Zalinsky.
Say something.
Mr. Zalinsky? I'm Tommy Callahan,
Big Tom Callahan's son.
Sorry to hear about your dad.
He was a good man.
Went a little heavy
on the pine-tree perfume there, kid.
Sir, it's a taxi-cab air freshener.
Great, you've pinpointed it.
Step two is washing it off.
Sir, what exactly happened here?
He came out of the shadows behind me.
And after he hit me many times
in the head with a hammer,
I had to give him my gun.
You know, I've got kids.
So, as more details emerge
on this attempted bank robbery
Action 8 will be there.
But the Callahan factory
has been in my family for 70 years,
you can't just shut it down.
You got to look at it
from my point of view.
Callahan's a premium name.
That's what I'm buying.
I can make the parts in one of my
factories, put them in a Callahan box
and sell them in my stores
at a premium price.
Why keep your factory going
when all I want is the goddamn box?
I'll tell you why.
Because there's a town involved here.
Callahan factory is the only thing
keeping it alive.
Believe it or not, I'm providing a service.
I'm thinning the corporate herd.
You've seen Daktari,
the weaker animals always go.
Sure the kids cry when you tie old Tiger
to a tree and shoot him.
But that's life.
America's in a state of renewal.
We gotta have the strength
to tie a few factories to a tree
and bash them with a shovel.
Meanwhile, if I can grab your share
of the market,
put a little coin in my pocket
by being the asshole,
well, what the hell? Know what I mean?
Boy, you sure are different
in your TV commercials.
What the American public
doesn't know
is what makes them
the American public.
All right?
God, I love that.
Hell, folks believe me when I tell them
we're not just building
automotive components here,
we're adding horsepower
to American industry.
You say one word to anyone and I will
kill you, do you understand me?
It looks real.
Yeah, television's been
good to me, son.
"I make car parts
for the American working man
"because that's what I am,
and that's who I care about."
The truth is, I make car parts
for the American working man
because I'm a hell of a salesman,
and he doesn't know any better.
Son, since you're no longer
a shareholder, this is where I leave you.
Don't feel bad. This chain of events
was set in motion a long time ago.
You and your bald-headed friend did
what you could, that's commendable.
Marty, have Security see these boys out.
- Mrs. Callahan.
- Sir.
I trust your trip went well.
What's my family doing in there?
I thought they were on my side.
They had a lot to gain
if the factory was sold.
Boy, did I screw up.
My so-called family deserted me.
Michelle's mad at me.
I lost the factory. The town's
going under, and I'm out of a job.
Could have done without that.
Jeez! I'm an idiot!
- Boy, I sure let my dad down.
- You tried as hard as you could.
When we first started out,
I thought you'd just walk through this
like you walk through everything else.
But you didn't.
Your dad would have been proud of you.
And you got a friend out of it.
Now, I know it doesn't matter,
because you have so many, but
I don't.
Thanks, man.
Tommy!
Michelle!
- Don't tell her about my hair.
- Let it go.
God, I was worried I wouldn't find you.
- What are you doing here?
- I got your message.
Okay, I was at the airport.
I was going home
and I saw your stepbrother and your
stepmother and he was kissing her.
- So?
- With his tongue.
- He's doing his mommy?
- She's not his mom. They're married.
They were lying to your dad
the whole time.
My brother got his police report. See?
- They lied to my dad?
- They're con artists. They suckered him.
They lied to my dad.
Richard, I'm gonna need your watch.
I've got a plan.
Yikes!
Folks, Mr. Zalinsky gave us
specific instructions
to bar you from the building.
Sorry, boys.
Hopefully, we'll just be in and out.
- My God, he's wired.
- And no cops.
Wouldn't want things to get messy.
- That was fun.
- Now what?
Well, it's 6:00. Time for the news.
Excuse me! Miss?
Oh, God.
Done this before?
Thank you, Marty.
My, your hands move quickly.
Only when I see something I want,
Mrs. Callahan.
It just doesn't seem right.
Hi! Got a second?
- What the hell's going on here?
- Oh, my God. We're gonna die.
- Tommy, what are you doing?
- Hi, Ted. Hi, Frank. Excuse me, Marty.
Okay, we're live.
We now switch live to our reporter
who is at the scene with the bomber.
This is Nicole Taylor
in downtown Chicago.
Look, it's Tommy!
...who says he strapped a bomb...
- Nicole, I've got something to say.
Please. May I?
Hi, this is Tommy Callahan here
with Mr. Ray Zalinsky
American Auto Parts King.
Honey, look at this human bomb
on the news.
Yeah, I buy brake pads off him.
I thought we were watching cartoons.
Mr. Zalinsky, for years
you've been putting ads on TV.
And they always end up with you saying,
"I make car parts for..."
How does it go?
I make car parts
for the American working man
because that's what I am
and that's who I care about.
And that's why I'm here, Ray.
You see, back in Sandusky, Ohio,
there are 300 American workers
at Callahan Auto.
We make the best parts money can buy.
Right now those workers
are in danger of losing their jobs.
They're praying somebody's gonna
step up and help them.
Is that why you
strapped a bomb to your chest?
This isn't a bomb.
These are road flares.
Road flares? Did you live under
power lines as a kid or something?
Why?
You guys want this
or American Gladiators?
Gladiators.
So, do you think Zalinsky Industries
can help these folks?
I'll be happy to look into it.
I'll tell you what.
I can get a good look at a T-bone
by sticking my head up a bull's ass
but I'd rather take
the butcher's word for it.
Am I just severely wasted
or does Tommy look bloated?
No, it's TV, man.
Camera adds a couple hundred pounds.
Ray, we're not looking
for a handout here.
I'm offering you a great deal.
This is an order for half a million
Callahan brake pads
to be sold in your stores
made by the American working man
for the American working man.
Well, absolutely.
It would be my great pleasure.
I mean, what have I got to lose?
A great American product, right?
I don't believe it. Tommy just sold
half a million brake pads.
Tommy just sold
a half a million brake pads!
Yeah!
What difference does it make?
The company's gonna be mine
in 10 minutes anyway, right?
Mr. Zalinsky, thank you.
Thank you, Tommy Boy. And thank you.
And remember, you can pick up these
great brake pads from Callahan Auto
at all my Zalinsky Auto Parts outlets
all over North America.
Go, Tommy!
For the moment it looks like a tragedy
has been averted
and a town has been saved.
For Action News, I'm Nicole Taylor,
reporting live.
Okay. We're out of here.
Wait a minute, fat boy.
You lost your shares to the bank.
You don't even have a right to be here.
Gee, funny you should bring that up.
'Cause I'm not sure
that you have the right to be here.
What have we got here?
- My God, it's a police report.
- Now what's all this about?
Let's see.
Paul Barrish, married, May, 1993
to Beverly Barrish, a.k.a. Beverly Burns.
Richard, how could Beverly be married
to Paul and my dad at the same time?
- Interesting.
- Yes. Provocative.
What I think it means is your marriage
to my dad was never legal.
Which also means that Beverly's shares
still belong to Tommy.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Rittenhauer?
- Yes. I believe that's right.
- Mr. Reilly?
- I'd say that's right.
- Mr. Gilmore?
- Absolutely.
And let me guess.
You're not going to be selling me
the company now.
- Are you, Tommy Boy?
- No, sir.
Ray, I have no idea
what they're talking about.
That's it. I'm not going to take this.
- It's not over yet, Lee Harvey.
- Let's see.
Warrants outstanding:
New Mexico, mail fraud
Colorado, wire fraud
and coming soon to Ohio,
computer fraud.
Get him!
Don't let him leave the complex, Marty.
- Hey, you forgot your wife.
- Screw you. Screw all of you!
Crash test in progress.
- Not good.
- Hit the brakes.
That will ruin his weekend.
Well, kid, you threw one by me.
Savor the flavor because it sure as hell
won't happen again.
- In the meantime, good luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.
Marty, cut a check to Callahan Auto
for those brake pads.
- Yes, sir.
- And you,
with all this excitement here,
I kind of got a little hungry.
Want to step over to my club
and we'll grab something to eat?
- Thank you. I'd like that.
- Good.
Marty, find out where the police
will be taking him.
Send over a bottle of bubbly
with a bucket of ice and a card.
Have it say, "Tough break.
Get drunk on me.
"Use the bucket to ice down
your marbles. Yours, Z."
Well, Mr. Callahan,
looks like we're back in business.
Yes, sir, Mr. Rittenhauer.
- That's great, Tommy.
- Great, Tommy.
Thanks.
Way to go, Tommy Callahan.
- That was pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard.
This is a very proud day for me.
I want to introduce you
to the new president of Callahan Auto,
Tom Callahan, Jr.
Tommy, will you say something?
Ever since I was a kid, you people
have been like a family to me.
Louis, we built our first fort together.
And, Danny, remember when we used
to burn ants with a magnifying glass?
R.T., I lost my virginity to your daughter,
for crying out loud.
Rob, you were there.
Anyway, I just want you to know
that as long as I'm around
I'm gonna bust my butt
and make sure that
every last one of you
always has a job right here at Callahan.
Dad, I got a little problem here.
I've been stuck out here for an hour
with no wind again
and I'm supposed to be at Michelle's
for dinner.
So if you could give me a little help
I'd appreciate it.
If not, don't worry about it.
I'm trying to do everything
I think you'd be doing
and so far it's going pretty good.
I just want to tell you
that I still love you and
I sure miss you a lot.
Thanks, Dad.
Son of a... That's gonna leave a mark.
