Falcon2, this is Lead.
Unidentified aircraft approaching.
<i>Keep In formatlon tlll I
<i>flnd out what they want.</i>
Bandits ten o'clock high.
Looks like MiG-23s.
Climb to 23,000 feet.
<i>I want to keep an angle on hlm.</i>
<i>Attentlon, Amerlcan Invaders...</i>
<i>... you are vlolatlng</i>
<i>our terrltorlal alrspace.</i>
What are they talking about?
This is Colonel Ted Masters
of the U.S. Air Force.
We're on a routine exer...
Pitch out! They're firing on us!
This is no drill!
<i>Flre when you get a lock on hlm.</i>
<i>Two MIGs.</i> 4 <i>o'clock.</i>
<i>Watch your tall.</i>
I'm coming around.
I'll pick up the leader.
<i>Got you covered.</i>
<i>Angle's looklng good.</i>
<i>Watch that bandlt</i>
<i>at 2 o'clock.</i>
Okay, palsy.
<i>Bandlt turnlng In tlght.</i>
Closing in on bandit.
<i>On your tall, Lleutenant.</i>
<i>Pull It up.</i>
<i>Pull It up.</i>
<i>Pull It up!</i>
I've been hit!
I'm dropping fuel fast!
<i>Get the hell</i>
<i>out of there, now!</i>
- But Colonel...
<i>- Move lt!</i>
<i>Afflrmatlve. Headlng back</i>
<i>to base. Good luck.</i>
Check in behind you, sucker.
That's it. Come on.
Thank you.
Four to one.
<i>These guys aren't taklng</i>
<i>any chances.</i>
Come on, Matt.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get off the phone! We had to meet
Tony and Reggie 20 minutes ago.
Quit bugging me!
I'm talking to Sheila Tallucci.
She's a junior.
Why are you messing with her?
Hold on.
She thinks I am too.
Now get out.
You're blowing it for me.
I'll take the Honda
and meet you guys later.
I thought Dad told you
not to ride that Honda off base.
How's he going to know
if he's not around?
Now disappear before
I have to pound you!
It's my little brother.
You know how kids are.
I'm leaving, Mom.
You'll pick up my tux?
At 12:00.
Doug, could you tell your sister
how nice she looks?
She does look nice.
I look gross.
You don't have to wear this
after tomorrow.
Your brother only graduates once.
It's a miracle
he's graduating at all.
Thanks a lot, runt.
Be home by 6:00.
Your dad's going to call in.
He wants to say hi to you and Katie
before the prom tonight.
Not waiting for the mail?
Today could be the day.
I'm late.
Are you out of your mind!?
Ten miles an hour!
How do you like the moves?
Been practicing for the prom tonight.
You guys look great.
I'm sorry I'm late, but...
Enjoy it, fool.
Pretty soon, if you don't show up
on time, they'll shoot your behind.
At the Academy, the word "tardy"
is not in the vocabulary.
What were they doing?
They came up behind me on the bridge.
Bastards!
What is it with you, Knotcher?
Can't you get through a day
without proving you're an asshole?
I was just having a little fun
with your girlfriend.
I figured maybe she'd realize
she deserves more from life...
...than some pussy Air Force brat.
D., just...
...forget about this big,
nasty, moose-lipped greaseball.
He wants to get you in trouble.
If the sheriff hears you been
fighting again, he'll put you in jail.
D., just chill.
I'm losing patience with you.
I'm losing patience with you.
It'd be easy to settle this
if you had any balls.
Just run the Snake with me.
You're a broken record.
You got Snake on the brain.
Didn't you learn nothing
from last time?
We love your jackets, boys.
Have a nice day.
He's the biggest creep.
No kidding.
That guy's bullshit
hasn't changed in 4 years.
Neither has his breath.
He'd kill you with it.
- It came right after you left.
- What is it?
Does the return address
"U.S. Air Force Academy...
...in Colorado Springs"
give you a clue?
Drum roll.
The best new applicant for the
Pilot Training Program is...
Not Doug Masters.
What did it say?
It said all that...
..."We regret to inform you" crap.
It said I didn't qualify.
Guess you had to
kind of expect it.
Maybe I didn't.
Let's face it, Doug.
With the grade point average?
We're talking
subterranean range here.
Just because of one lousy "F."
And I only got it because
I always had to cut class...
...to sneak in the simulator.
<i>Good mornlng.</i>
<i>I have an announcement...</i>
<i>... of speclal Interest</i>
<i>to you mllltary personnel.</i>
Little Dougie Masters...
<i>... has regretfully been denled</i>
<i>admlsslon to the Alr Force Academy.</i>
Too bad.
<i>He would've looked so cute</i>
<i>In hls llttle unlform and halrcut...</i>
...marching around
with the other fairies.
What's the matter, flybaby?
You're dead.
I'll wait till you come out.
Then you're mine.
If we fight, you have
to deal with the sheriff.
If we race, it's just
the mountains and me.
You got it.
Be at Mclntyre's in an hour.
Have Raymond gas up my plane.
I'm flying the Snake.
Doug, you'll get killed!
Just like Jimmy Branson did.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Will you hand me
that Phillips head?
Why are you working
on my plane?
The Phillips head, boy.
The Phillips head.
What are you doing working on
my plane? Raymond was...
You're flying the Snake.
How'd you know?
Why are you making
my mixture so rich?
How low you have to keep it
to the ground?
50 feet. Why?
Because lean as you were running,
if it stalled...
...you'd have lost your engine and
never been able to pull it out.
That's what happened to Jimmy.
It happened to
the Branson kid, all right.
He didn't know that, either.
They sure couldn't tell him after
they peeled him off that cliff.
What do I owe you?
We can talk about that later.
If you come back.
According to the rules
of the Snake...
...Doug can take any route
through the mountains...
...as long as he sticks under the
50-foot height limit.
Knotcher, you got to stick
to the main road.
You'll loop through Dragon Canyon
and end up back here.
Who will make sure Masters doesn't
pull up if he gets scared?
If he pulls up...
...he's disqualified.
Packer and Brillo can ride monitor
with me and Reggie.
Let's do it.
Good luck. I'm climbing.
That music is jamming!
<i>Dance to those rocks!</i>
How's he doing?
Let's put it this way:
My stomach hurts
from watching this guy fly.
What's with Knotcher?
He almost started
a new career...
<i>... as a hood ornament.</i>
He should just land on the
fool and get it over with.
Don't you feel like flying today?
Flying, yes.
Dying, no.
That's not the main road.
A road's a road.
That'll take 10 minutes
off his time.
<i>He's cuttlng through on the flre road.</i>
<i>No way you can beat hlm now.</i>
It ain't over yet.
You're coming up on Devil's Face.
<i>That's where Jlmmy Branson bought lt.</i>
You did it!
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Reggle, would you</i>
<i>glve me a break?</i>
Pull up!
Man, you're toying with death.
You know that, right?
Keep jamming to the tunes.
You're zooming!
Smoke's pouring out of your manifold!
I'm losing oil pressure.
Shut her down!
You'll seize your engine!
Wonder what a Cessna looks
like splattered on the rocks.
What did you do
to his engine, you freak!
Knotcher made me do it.
He had me adjust his oil cap.
Packer loosened your pressure cap.
<i>Land the plane!</i>
Land the plane!
Stop acting crazy!
You'll get killed!
Easy.
Coming up on Knotcher.
I can beat him.
Don't be a fool!
Just land!
Land the plane.
Don't stall on me now.
Go! Go! Go!
You got him!
Now take it home!
Shit.
Rough landing, flybaby?
It was just a joke, man.
It's pretty funny.
You could've killed me.
What?
I said you could've killed me.
Couldn't hear you.
Can you hear me now?
Doug, you've got to
come with me now.
It's your dad.
You got to get back to the base.
He's been shot down.
Jesus.
They just found out about it.
Come on.
- We got to get Matt.
- I'll get Matt. You go.
When will they release him?
They don't know.
Didn't they tell you why
he was flying so near the coast?
The general said...
...they couldn't tell me.
I'll be back in a minute.
Is Colonel Blackburn in there?
You can't go in there!
Who do you think you are?
Lighten up. I just want
to talk to Colonel Blackburn.
I suppose you want some answers.
Nobody's telling us
what's going on.
I figured since you and Dad
have been friends for so long...
...you'd tell me the truth.
What'd they tell you so far?
Just that Dad was flying
over the Med when he got jumped.
And then something crazy
about a trial.
It's kind of
a complicated situation.
Hell, it's a bunch of nonsense!
Some countries play a little
different than we do.
Come on. Stick on
my heels for a minute.
I'll get in trouble...
...for showing you this,
so keep your mouth shut.
We fly navigation
exercises to establish...
International airspace.
My dad told me that.
He wasn't in their territory.
Why'd they fire on him?
They claim 200 miles...
...about out to here.
We only recognize 12.
They usually don't mess with us,
but this time...
...they caught us with our pants down.
Your dad didn't have a chance.
But he waxed 3 of them before he bailed.
What's this about a trial?
They're full of shit!
We asked for a carrier!
They said they couldn't cooperate.
It's nonsense!
Get Admiral what's-his-nuts
on the horn.
Tell him the general
wants to talk to him.
I'm sorry, Doug.
I'll tell you one thing:
I don't like the way the State
Department's playing this.
We're holding the aces, and they act
like we only got a pair of twos.
We thought a carrier
off their coast...
...might put a fire up their butt.
They denied our request.
They say they're negotiating.
Will you please tell me what's going on?
He's being tried for violating
their territory.
We know it's bullshit.
Washington knows it's bullshit.
The State Department
thinks it's a bluff.
They think they're
using him as a bargaining chip.
For what?
They're what's called a "pariah nation."
They're probably using this to get us to
lift our trade embargo.
What's going to happen?
I don't know yet.
We hope to hear
what they want tomorrow.
Till then, there's not much
any of us can do...
...since the suits in the White House
have tied our hands.
You'll have to be patient.
We don't even have diplomatic
relations with them.
So it takes a heap of time
just to make a phone call.
I got the admiral on the horn.
Hang in there, son.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, it came a minute ago.
I think the general will
want to pursue this further.
I don't know how
you can stay so calm.
Because I've been through it before.
You don't remember.
You were only four years old.
That time your dad
had to bail out over the Pacific.
The whole time he was missing,
I didn't know if he was alive.
I got to call Katie and tell her
I'm not going tonight.
And tell the Winslows
not to come for graduation.
Doug, that is not going to help him.
He's stuck over there,
but he's thinking about us.
He's thinking about you and Katie...
...getting dressed up tonight.
He's thinking about you
getting your diploma tomorrow.
That's all he's got right now.
Somehow...
...if you don't go...
...it takes it all away from him.
Look, I'm very scared.
I'll admit that to you.
But if you start thinking
the worst will happen...
...somehow it always does.
What'd you find out?
I'll tell you in the car.
Let's go pick up Amy.
Is Dad going to be all right?
Yeah, Dad's going to be fine.
You go with Mom.
I'll be home in a little while.
What did Blackburn tell you?
He said they think they're
holding him for ransom or something.
Can you nose around your dad's office,
see what they want from him?
I was just there. Everybody in
Intelligence is scrambling.
They're keeping a lid on this.
Nobody's talking.
Come on, Milo.
All right.
I'll see what else I can find out.
Thanks a lot.
Is there anything we can do?
No, nothing.
Guess you won't feel like going tonight?
I didn't at first, but...
...it's better than sitting home
going crazy over this.
Listen, Doug...
...everything will work out.
They won't mess with us.
The Air Force will kick ass if they do.
Like in Iran.
That was different.
Mr. Peanut was in charge then.
Now we got a President who don't take
shit from gimpy countries.
Why do you think they call him
Ronnie Ray Gun?
I almost forgot.
I got some boutonnieres.
This smells so good.
Take a whiff.
Go ahead.
You are allowed
a statement on your behalf.
This court is a fraud.
At no time did I violate
your territorial airspace.
At no time did we engage in any
intelligence-gathering operation.
This trial is a blatant
violation of international law.
The American naiveté
never ceases to amaze me.
We make the laws in this country.
We are not subject to your...
...ridiculous Western alliances.
I am a pilot myself.
And when in flight,
I am always aware...
...of my exact position.
I have no doubt
you were quite clear about yours.
Your country has been warned
time and time again!
Yet your leaders choose
to make light of our demands.
Reparation is our due...
...and we shall have our due.
They didn't ask for anything?
They didn't. I was right
outside my dad's office.
None of them could believe it!
They've held the trial
and found your dad guilty.
What does that mean?
Nobody knows. They haven't sentenced
him yet. It could mean prison, or...
Why are they playing so tough?
The State Department thinks...
...they don't want other nations thinking
they're chicken of the U.S.
They're trying to set an example.
When are they going in?
The Marines! They ain't going to sit
and take this crap!
Nothing's being planned.
But my dad thinks they'll
work something out.
What are they going to work out?
How many years is he going to
stay in that shithole?
What are they doing about it?
Dad says they're negotiating.
They won't do shit and you know it!
Doug's here.
I'm sorry about not being able to
return your calls...
...but since thing's heated up,
the general's had me hopping.
Colonel, don't lie to me.
Are you guys planning something?
We're doing all we can.
Which is nothing, isn't it?
They're trying to talk to them.
Trying to make them listen to reason.
Other than that,
we got nothing on the boards.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, so am I.
I heard what happened
to your dad, and I...
Marty, I was wondering
if you could slip me in?
Tell you what...
There's someone due in now,
but he's running late.
I'll load it up, and
you take it till he gets here.
Just keep cool about this.
It isn't the same as
sneaking you in at night.
Okay, I'll set you up with some MiGs.
Enemy squadron sighted.
All right, you bastards.
Climbing to flight level 2-7-0.
Have radar. Locking on to engage.
What else you got, Marty?
This is Bluebird.
<i>Enemy approachlng</i>
<i>at fllght level 2-2-0.</i>
- <i>Conflrm.</i>
- Roger.
Shit!
<i>Excellent move.</i>
That's four.
I don't believe it.
<i>The dlve's too extreme! Pull It up!</i>
<i>Check your radar!</i>
Marty, I don't believe
those guys could've...
Fancy maneuvering's no good...
...if you don't watch
the guys flying behind you.
I didn't see them. I couldn't.
Watch the HUD! That's what it's for.
Try cutting out that music.
Sorry, Colonel.
We used up all your time.
- Catch you next week.
- You got it.
You keep your chin up, buddy.
Thanks a lot.
Something you want to ask me?
I didn't know you were still
in the Air Force.
I'm not.
Are you in the reserves?
How come you're working
as a mechanic?
Because fixing airplanes
is something I like to do.
Anything else you want to ask?
I wasn't trying to write a book.
I was just curious.
Your dad's a strong man.
He'll be okay.
You know him?
No, but let's say I know the type.
That's what's important.
If more people were like him,
he wouldn't be stuck there.
What do you mean mean by that?
Nobody's doing anything.
They don't have the balls
to make those bastards release him.
I see.
What do you think we should do?
Launch some missiles,
go to war over it?
Of course not.
But how tough is it? They're
a shitty little country.
It's not the matter of being tough.
It's the way they do things.
Too many people making decisions.
I've seen them operate.
They take too long.
You've seen them plan one of these?
A bunch of times.
But they usually lose
more lives than they save.
Your dad is a lot better off,
probably, if they negotiate.
With the right plan, would it
be simple to go and get him?
Not simple, but it's possible.
Could you plan it?
Why?
I want to know.
Probably.
What do you think it would take?
A hell of a lot more than you got, kid.
Wait a minute.
Dad's got a lot of people
on the base that love him.
Being friends with someone's
a lot different...
...than risking your life for them.
Let me ask you this.
Do you think an F-16, fully armed
with all its firepower...
...could fly in there and pull it off?
Stop wasting your time!
The Air Force won't do anything!
They'll do a hell of a lot more
than you think.
They just won't know they're doing it.
I'm telling you, I bet you
can get a plane...
...all the firepower it can carry,
aerial recon, intelligence.
I got the whole goddamn base wired.
Anything you need... I can get you.
You wired enough to get me pilots?
I can get you one.
I know this is the toughest thing
you've ever been through.
But hanging onto these crazy ideas...
...isn't going to make it any easier.
Take it easy.
You don't think I can fly?
Don't talk stupid.
You think flying an F-16 in combat
is the same as flying the Snake?
- Would you listen?
- I'm listening.
I've got three times as many
hours on that simulator...
...as most pilots flying Falcons
on the base.
As for combat,
you know that's bullshit.
How many guys here have been in
dogfights? Four, five tops?
The simulator trains them, and they
defend the whole country.
You think because they're...
...3 or 4 years older
it makes any difference?
I've missed my simulator time. I won't
miss my flight time. I got to go.
Let me go with you.
I've been up a a bunch of times
with Dad.
At least let me show you what I can do.
I'm tired of talking about it.
I'm going.
You know he ain't got a chance!
But you don't give a shit enough
to help him!
You're no different than anyone else!
You really believe that nonsense
you're saying?
Look at me when I talk to you!
Let me clue you in on something
right now.
I've given this country 22 damn fucking
years of my life!
22 years!
I've seen young boys blown out of
the air over the Pacific!
I've seen their guts spread all over.
So every time somebody dies for this
country, I give a shit!
Nobody talks to me like this!
I'm not going to start now!
You want to help your father?
Be strong for your family.
Stay right here!
I'm pleased to present...
...this year's valedictorian,
Edward Thatcher.
Students, faculty and parents:
Each year, we as students
have the luxury of our dreams...
...without the responsibilities
of our sustenance.
Therefore, our gratitude must be to
those who give us that freedom...
...so that we can grow. To our parents,
I dedicate this ceremony.
What were those loops and rolls,
Colonel?
I thought we were supposed to keep
strict formation during training.
I had a malfunction
in my throttle sensor, Major.
I was trying to sort out the problem.
I thought you were going
to do some skywriting.
I may have a problem with my receiver.
I heard music up there.
I must have picked up
a radio station or something.
I'll have it checked out.
These are training maneuvers,
not auditions for the Thunderbirds!
It's not a rock concert.
Get over there!
What the hell were you thinking?
Do you know what could happen if
you got caught in that plane?
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
You bet it won't. That's the last
time you go up with me.
- Come on, Dad.
- I don't want to hear it!
You're graduating. When will you show
some responsibility?
When I'm gone, I'd like to
have a little confidence...
...that I know you can handle things.
At some point you've got to grow up.
Is that an order, sir?
Yeah, that's an order.
Understood, sir.
May I ask the colonel a question?
Go ahead.
Did he like the reverse spirals I
executed at 22,000 feet?
They've been rehearsed all week
in the simulator.
I did.
Get out of here. The colonel's
wife thinks you're at school.
Yes, sir.
<i>Today Is an lmportant day</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>
A turning point.
A time to realize it's time
to stop being children.
A time to take charge
of our lives and destinies.
This is the time
to believe in ourselves...
...or leave our dreams behind.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
I didn't want to tell you before.
They heard from Washington.
Your dad's been sentenced.
Three days.
Three days?
What do you mean, three days?
They're going to hang him.
In three days,
they're going to hang him.
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?
About Dad.
I think we can help him.
How?
I think I know a way...
...to go in and get him out.
God. When are we going?
Come on, I need you to do
something for me.
What do you want me to do?
Call all the Eagles.
Tell them to meet me at the
clubhouse tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
I got a bunch of things to work out.
Come on, go on.
You going to call?
Are they really going to kill him?
I'm not waiting around to find out.
Now go on.
Welcome, Minister.
We will take you to the prison at once.
I've been informed you will not
sign the confession we require.
I came to ask you to reconsider.
You see?
I am a compassionate man.
I understand your courage
and your sense of duty.
But there are those
in power above me...
...who do not share my sentiments.
If you mean your beloved leader,
have him come here...
...and see me personally.
I'll give him a confession.
I'll shove it up his ass!
First, I want to thank you
for coming so early.
You know what's happened
to my father.
I know you'd do anything for him.
We've been together
for a long time.
And together, we've gotten
everything we needed...
...for our classes and airshows.
Now I need you to come up with
some stuff to help my dad.
If we don't come up with it,
he hasn't got much of a chance.
I got a list here...
...of everything we need to get.
Starting off with...
Dad, I'll take these to Hazel myself.
I wanted to say hi anyway.
<i>Entrez.</i>
I got some more updates
from my dad for you.
Thanks, Milo. Great.
Oh, my God!
Look how many of them there are.
Getting pretty heavy-duty
around here.
I know.
Stop!
I thought you had this thing fixed.
I did!
Go input on the mainframe.
I'll call someone.
Yeah, then we won't get behind.
It's urgent that we get this out
and not lose time.
You'll get him then?
Sure.
I promise.
Great.
Now, I'll work on these.
You are an angel, Milo.
This is wonderful.
I'll be at the mainframe.
I should be back in an hour.
What are you guys doing here?
I just brought my friend down
to see those new Packer 32s.
You know I can't sneak you guys
in here during the daytime.
Come on, Sweeney.
My sister said to ask you
to do it for her.
Was she really talking about me?
I heard her tell Mom...
...she's pretty upset that
you don't call her more often.
I can sneak you in
for 5 minutes...
...until Dover gets back.
But only one of you.
Go ahead.
I've seen them.
Hi, Dad!
What are you guys up to?
We came to get that picture
you promised us for our room.
Remember, the satellite photo
of the earth...
...with the weather on it,
and stuff?
That was months ago.
What made you come for that now?
You forgot to bring it home
the last 4 times we asked you.
I guess you're right.
I'll go get it.
We can get it!
Don't be silly, I got time.
I didn't mean to.
I got to go to the latrine
and wash this out.
Go in the back, get the picture.
Put it in this sleeve.
I'll leave you a clearance
with Connie to get it out.
Thanks.
I'm glad you brought these down.
Mom's starving me on this new diet.
Shit!
- What do we got?
- Delta 6-6-2.
Get the Falcon maintenance file.
F-16s BR4.
Bingo! We're in!
Who is it?
It's Doug Masters.
I know what you said before.
And I'm sorry about what I said.
But I came to ask you one last time
if you'd help me.
I got the aerial recon of everything
those bastards got over there.
Coastal defenses, surface-to-air
missile emplacements...
...and troop locations.
I know where their fighter base is,
and their fighter capacity.
I know where they're holding my dad.
Got a picture of the building.
I got intelligence.
Tons of it. I know every move
they make and when they make it.
When they fly maneuvers.
Every move in and out
of their airports.
If you need to know, I can tell you
when somebody goes to the can.
I can get you an F-16
with anything you want on it.
Sidewinders, Mk 82 Snake Eyes...
...cluster bombs, Durandels,
Paveway smart bombs...
...and all the 30mm rounds
the GE-Pod can carry.
Jesus, he's only got...
Three days! Three days.
And if you keep on talking
you'll waste one.
Bring that stuff.
When did you work this up?
Last night.
When I heard about
that trial.
You think you can
figure something out?
Come up with a plan?
I'm a long way from
answering that question, son.
But I sure would like to try.
Something about maniacs
messing with good men...
...that always pisses me off.
I'll need to find a place...
...for aerial recon, fighter bases...
...the place where they're
keeping him...
...scheduling info...
And you read me the intelligence
when I ask you, okay?
How can you think
with that music on?
Come on, let's see what you got.
Let's see what you got.
Quick. Too much time.
What's wrong?
Got your tennis shoes on?
Yeah, why?
Bring all the intelligence readouts
and follow me.
Get any of that
coastal defense info yet?
Two trawlers...
...50mm guns.
But they're currently in the Gulf.
This would be easier
if I had on my shorts on.
How many times have I told you,
don't interrupt me when I'm thinking!
Read me that fighter status again.
Find it?
There's only 5 choppers
stationed there.
Get me the anti-aircraft locations.
- Which ones?
- All of them.
That'll take some time.
They're listed all over the place.
Like Italian?
You can eat
while you read.
Slappy, I'd like for you
to meet Doug here.
This is Slappy,
the owner of the place.
He's the one you have to sue
for food poisoning.
Good to see you come around
and contribute to my retirement.
Even bring some white folk in here.
I like that.
You better leave me alone.
We've got some high-level conference
talking to do.
- Excuse me!
- Excuse you.
Find it?
Right here.
Let's see.
Move it like this...
The plane comes through here,
knocks out this pepperoni here.
You got to be careful of this olive.
This cheese here will nail your butt.
Through this lettuce,
tight around this carrot...
...a second plane will sneak in.
What do you mean?
Who's flying a second plane?
Who do you think?
I'm taking out these pepperonis.
I don't believe it!
Why?
Are you prejudiced?
Don't play with me.
Why are you flying?
Let's just say that when I met your dad,
he earned my respect.
I do a lot for people I respect.
- When did you first meet him?
- About two years ago.
I'd booked some simulator module time.
I was late. I still had on coveralls,
my hands all covered with grease.
I even forgot my ID card.
Wouldn't you know...
...the guy on the module was new.
He said, "Get your black butt
out of here before I call security."
A couple of hotshot pilots
thought it was real funny.
Didn't you want to kick their ass?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But at that time, your dad
walks out of the simulator module.
I'd never seen him before.
He asked what was happening.
When they told him the story...
...he walks over to me and looks
at me for a fast second.
Steps back and snaps me a salute.
Says, "Sorry, sir, we'll get things
set up right away, Colonel."
Your dad understands a lot
about people's dignity.
That's the last kind of person
I want to see locked in some cage.
He won't be. We'll bust him out
of there like a bat out of hell.
All we have got so far is a plan.
All you've proven to me is you can
steal computer printouts and pictures.
After tomorrow, he's only got one day
left. Are we going for it or not?
We are going when I say we are going.
You still got
a lot left to prove to me.
Keep your mouth shut,
and listen to what I have to ask you.
I want to test you,
make sure that you can deliver...
...what you say you can deliver.
Name it.
I want a couple of F-16s...
...with full, approved flight plans.
Along with the stuff I give you
are the 2 phony names I'll let you have.
And I want a trainer at the same time,
on the tarmac tomorrow.
I'll let you put your money
where your mouth is.
You still don't believe I can fly,
do you?
Maybe and maybe not.
I want to test you out
on some live targets.
Great.
You won't be disappointed.
I hope not.
Or else we ain't going nowhere, boy.
Understand?
Enough!
You are a very stubborn man, Colonel.
It would be easier
if you'd accommodate us...
...with a signed admission of guilt...
...but we can proceed without it.
I must say,
I admire the way you can handle pain.
I'm looking forward to seeing you
handle death.
Good thing Milo's on our side.
My name's Colonel Sinclair.
I believe you have me down
for that trainer.
Your name's not listed.
- Let me check this with flight control.
- That's not necessary.
Just got orders
to take these two in.
Sorry about the screwup, sir.
Yours came in on the special last night.
- She's ready to go.
- What's this about taking us in?
Not you, sir.
I mean these two Falcons.
They were all set up to go to Spain.
Crew worked all night to load them.
Computer just canceled it.
A pain in the ass.
- She's ready to go.
- Thank you.
Get off the ground quick,
before this gets canceled.
Computer's been acting
kind of strange today.
<i>You're cleared for takeoff.</i>
<i>Runaway 3-0.</i>
Think you can get us over to runway 3-0?
If you come up here and show me
where the throttle is in these things.
I'm starting not to like you.
This is Falcon 6 ready for takeoff.
<i>Okay for takeoff.</i>
Where do you want to go?
You're driving.
Let's see
what you got.
Sure you're up to it?
<i>You're not one of those hot dogs,</i>
<i>are you?</i>
How's that?
Thought you was a pilot,
not an astronaut.
I guess you're right.
By the way...
...I forgot to ask
when you ate last.
You'd know
if I had a big breakfast.
Want to see me...
...turn?
Now I'm really
starting not to like you.
Head over to the range.
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.
<i>Comlng up to lt.</i>
<i>I want you to clrcle around low.</i>
<i>Go north. Take out those</i>
<i>two vertlcal targets up ahead.</i>
Remember!
The simulator's different.
Just got to feel your way.
I want you to concentrate.
Cut off that stuff!
Lt'll ruin my rhythm.
If you don't,
I'll ruin something else!
Shit!
I told you.
This time...
<i>... I want you to drop a Mark 82</i>
<i>to that horlzontal up ahead.</i>
We can't go in there
with you shooting like this!
Turn this thing around.
Let's head back to base.
Damn it,
I'll do it my way.
Nice piece of work!
Are we going for it?
There's still some things...
All right!
Sounds like we're going!
Get your Eagles.
There's still details to work out.
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.
I figure you can do
your first 500 miles at Mach.6...
...and your last 180 at Mach.9
after your last refuel.
- Did you account for wind current?
- I got the face winds.
When we get back, we're going to
have to go into business together.
In a dogfight, you must always
remember to keep the angle on them.
Attack them either from
the side, the top or the back.
If they come at you straight,
like this...
You better eject,
and start doing some backstroking!
Most important is to watch
your air speed as they talk you in.
Be careful. Use a deep voice
or they'll know you're a kid.
Let me hear you talk.
This is Bluebird...
No, it's got to be deeper. Put some
bass in your voice, like Slappy.
Do it again.
This is the Bluebird.
I be ready to refuel.
Doug, move that control tower
about 10 degrees to the north.
No, that's the oil refinery.
That's the detention center
where he's being held.
That's what's left of my lunch.
Get that out of there.
You must be in love!
The control tower is over here.
Cheese!
All right, gentlemen
and ladies.
Time for the final check for tomorrow's
operation. I hope you're ready.
Status on the Falcons.
Two F-16Bs standing by
on the northern runway as requsted.
Fuel?
Fully fueled.
Interior and exterior tanks.
- Armaments?
- As requested and visually verified.
Thank you.
- Flight plans cleared?
- Both fully authorized.
Refuel?
I have a list of times and coordinates,
all verified.
Place of detention?
As of 1500 hours, Col. Masters
is still being held at the same location.
No change in enemy plans reported.
I congratulate you all
on some fine work.
You've come a long way
in a short while.
I don't judge people
by their experience...
...but by their performance.
Yours has been exemplary.
I'd like to shake your hands.
I've never had a finer planning staff.
You go home to Mom and tell her
I'm out with Reggie and Tony.
After tomorrow,
you're in charge.
But only for a couple of days.
It's a promise!
Without you guys,
there's no way...
We know that!
Eagles.
Show me the armaments availability list.
I've come up with an idea that'll
give us some added insurance.
I'm too loaded down...
...so you have to carry it.
Carry what?
The Hades bomb.
How fast can Milo work?
He can rearm in 3 hours.
What do I do with the Hades?
Before you land...
...I want you to lay one in right here.
It's got its good points
and its bad points.
The good point is they won't be able
to see or touch you for 5 minutes.
But you won't see them either.
Now listen to me.
Look!
Once this fire goes out,
if you're not in the air...
...you are a dead man.
Now I want you to
get your butt in my trailer.
Get some sleep. I've got some
work to do and I need my privacy.
I've got to see my Mom
and I have to call Katie.
What are you going to tell them?
- I don't know...
- I don't know either!
You can't tell them the truth!
I'll tell you what. I'll have
Slappy talk to both of them...
...after we have gone.
Okay?
Now you get in my trailer. Now.
I said, get your butt in my
trailer...
...now!
Yes, sir.
<i>Yes, Mlnlster,</i>
<i>we are standlng by.</i>
Give the American his final meal.
After tomorrow, he will not have
much of an appetite.
I told you to get some sleep.
I'm just relaxing a bit.
Watching a little TV.
I don't need much sleep for this.
How do you know
what you need for this?
I just meant I'm ready.
You're ready, aren't you?
You think it's going to be so easy,
don't you?
I don't think it will all be easy.
I'm just ready for it.
You ain't ready for shit, boy!
Open it!
Go ahead, open it!
Who are these guys?
Kids that thought they
were ready too.
- Pilots?
- All of them.
They look about 22 or 23.
That's right.
I don't see why you're so worried.
How are they
different from me?
Because they're dead!
All of them.
I lay awake at night...
...thinking about how fast
and how brutal they died.
Parts of them falling on the land,
parts of them falling in the sea.
Some parts of them burning
just into nothing in the air.
All of them...
...thought they were ready for it.
When it was all over...
...I promised myself I'd never
be part of killing kids again.
That's why it took so long
to come around to helping you.
I've got us both trapped...
...into something...
- That could kill us?
I know that, Chappy.
And those kids?
I don't know what you think anymore,
but they knew it too.
Maybe they weren't ready for it,
but who the hell is ever ready?
You didn't get me into this.
I went to you, remember?
I know what we're risking.
And I'm proud
to be able to fly with you.
Maybe I'm not all that ready...
...but I'm damn proud.
Enough of this nonsense.
Where's the tape recorder?
In my bag, next to the sink.
Wait a minute.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To see what you're doing.
Go see what my pillow is doing.
I want you asleep in five minutes.
Wait a minute.
I almost forgot.
It's my first pair.
- I'll bring them back.
- You better. Now get to bed.
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.
<i>It sure Is strange</i>
<i>maklng you thls tape.</i>
<i>I just got flnlshed</i>
<i>talklng to you.</i>
<i>You had that look on your face.</i>
<i>The look you had when you</i>
<i>asked me to help get your father.</i>
<i>I never told you</i>
<i>how I felt about you.</i>
<i>Always had a problem</i>
<i>talklng about my feellngs.</i>
<i>I want to tell you, you've got</i>
<i>more courage than anybody I've ever met.</i>
<i>You'll need every blt of It</i>
<i>to get through thls thlng.</i>
<i>I want you to know, I'm proud</i>
<i>to have been by your slde.</i>
<i>And whatever happens,</i>
<i>just remember you trled.</i>
<i>And no one can</i>
<i>take that away from us.</i>
<i>Okay for takeoff.</i>
<i>Okay for takeoff.</i>
Switch to frequency 8, over.
I switched frequencies, over.
That fancy flying
will eat up your fuel!
I was getting used to the throttle.
It's a little touchy.
Lucky I'm not in that cockpit with you.
I'd show you "touchy."
<i>Use the other channels only to</i>
<i>communlcate wlth checkpolnts.</i>
<i>They can monltor us,</i>
<i>except on thls frequency.</i>
Roger, Colonel, sir.
Climb up to 35,000 feet and relax
until we hit the first refuel.
<i>Get your alr speed perfect.</i>
Come in real steady.
Congratulations!
Couldn't have done better myself.
Do they pump this for you,
or is this self-service?
Smart-ass kids!
Are you sleeping?
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just felt all alone all of a sudden.
Try not to think about it.
<i>Just thlnk about your dad,</i>
<i>and how alone he must feel.</i>
Do you think he knows
how much I really love him?
Sometimes he'd be tough with me,
like you are.
I know it's only for my own good,
but I never told him I understood.
He knows.
Believe me.
He just wants to
make a man out of you.
Is that why
you treat me the same way?
To make a man out of me?
No, your dad already did that.
I'm just trying to
get us out of this alive.
Chap, what if I screw up?
What if everything goes wrong?
Then I'll get real mad!
You've never seen me mad!
I wouldn't want to, either.
Then don't screw up!
<i>Thlnk about the plan.</i>
<i>Go over It In your head...</i>
<i>... every step of It In your head</i>
<i>untll you have got It automatlc.</i>
I still show a 7-minute delay
from my first refuel.
We've got to make up time.
<i>We'll break our fllght plan</i>
<i>In 5 mlnutes. Do your verlflcatlon.</i>
It'll heat up from here.
<i>How do you feel?</i>
My stomach's a little tight.
Must be that cereal I ate.
It's funny.
It tastes good going down...
...then 13 hours later, it makes you
scared shitless. It will pass.
Do a checkout list.
They'll know something's up now.
If checkpoint contacts us, ignore it.
<i>By the tlme they flgure It out,</i>
<i>we'll be over the coast.</i>
Bring up the stores list.
Watch that carefully. Keep it
in your head. It's all you got.
<i>Look at your fuel gauge.</i>
<i>It's all you got too.</i>
Run out of either one of them,
you're dead meat.
I got that.
<i>We're runnlng at Mach.6. Drop</i>
<i>to 3,000 feet and hold your alr speed.</i>
<i>Watch out for naval vessels.</i>
<i>Falcon 1, you have devlated</i>
<i>from your fllght plan.</i>
<i>Please advlse.</i>
Just you and me, kid.
<i>Drop down to 3000 feet,</i>
<i>llke I told you.</i>
<i>When we're 100 mlles off the coast,</i>
<i>drop to 400 feet.</i>
<i>Keep under that</i>
<i>or they'll see you on radar.</i>
I know that.
<i>I bet you thought you knew that.</i>
Did you know their missiles
got French radar?
<i>You can fool them</i>
<i>wlth foll packs.</i>
I didn't know that.
Bet you didn't know that.
Didn't think so.
<i>Hlt the coast, punch It to Mach.9,</i>
<i>but not supersonlc.</i>
<i>It'd be too easy</i>
<i>to know we're comlng.</i>
When we reach the mountains,
stay low and hug them tight.
"Snake" them right, and they won't know
what hit them.
<i>You go for the runway, and I'll take</i>
<i>out the tower and communlcatlons.</i>
<i>Don't mlss.</i>
<i>You've only got</i> 4 <i>clusters.</i>
<i>Make each one count.</i>
<i>Make sure you llne them up rlght.</i>
<i>And play the rlght muslc.</i>
These guys ain't no rookies
that shot down your dad.
You won't freeze up?
Anybody ever say you talk too much?
Yeah, my ex-wife.
<i>There's the enemy coast.</i>
<i>Start the jammlng.</i>
<i>Comlng up to the mountalns.</i>
Radar hasn't caught us so far.
We're still 7 minutes behind schedule.
<i>Remember, they run mornlng maneuvers</i>
<i>at 0730. We must plck up tlme...</i>
...or we'll be in MiG soup.
<i>Stay below 300 feet to beat the radar.</i>
<i>I got somethlng to help make up</i>
<i>some tlme. Keep the channel clear.</i>
This ain't no game!
I could get used to that.
We made up 3 minutes.
<i>Radar hasn't plcked us up yet.</i>
<i>It's 7:30.</i>
<i>I hope they're late.</i>
<i>I don't want to thlnk about lt.</i>
Get ready.
Il Kharem is coming up.
They picked us up on radar!
Too late for them now.
Just cluster that runway.
I'll do the rest.
<i>Three MIGs have taken off.</i>
We'll handle them in the air.
Just take out that runway!
I hit it!
I got the runway and the plane.
Congratulate yourself later.
Now worry about those 3 MiGs.
Climb!
They're running away!
They're just getting out of the way.
Move your butt!
<i>Get out of range</i>
<i>of the guns!</i>
Damn!
<i>I got them!</i>
<i>I got all three of the guns!</i>
Yeah, but one of them got me.
How bad?
Didn't get me head-on.
But close enough.
What kind of damage?
All kinds of electrical problems.
<i>Two MIGs comlng up fast.</i>
Follow me.
Listen carefully.
<i>I want you to load the tape</i>
<i>I made you thls mornlng.</i>
What? What's on it?
Don't argue with me!
Is it loaded yet?
Don't interrupt.
I'll only say this once.
<i>Anythlng happens to me,</i>
<i>cllmb out of weapon range...</i>
...and play that tape.
It may be the only thing
to save your ass.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
<i>Llsten to me.</i>
<i>When the MIGs get In range,</i>
<i>spllt from me...</i>
<i>... and proceed</i>
<i>to the next target.</i>
<i>One wlll follow you</i>
<i>and one wlll follow me.</i>
<i>I'll head toward the Medlterranean.</i>
<i>Don't let them get the drop on you.</i>
I want to stay with you.
How can you handle them?
Don't you worry about me.
Just do what I told you.
And concentrate.
<i>Your dad Is dependlng on you.</i>
<i>Spllt off from me now!</i>
All right, you bastard!
Give me your position. I waxed
a bandit and I'm coming to you.
I told you, damn it!
<i>Put In that tape,</i>
<i>and don't worry about me.</i>
Damn it!
Just hold together
for two more seconds.
Mayday.
<i>Mayday.</i>
Chappy, where are you?
Put in that tape. That's an order.
Nothing you can do about me.
<i>I want to help you.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Cllmb hlgh, llke I told you!</i>
<i>I aln't golng to make lt.</i>
<i>A bunch of thlngs must've gone wrong</i>
<i>If you're llstenlng to thls.</i>
<i>Whatever happened, I know</i>
<i>you must be real scared.</i>
<i>I wouldn't blame you If you</i>
<i>wanted to head for home.</i>
<i>Maybe If I was you, I'd make a run</i>
<i>for Helllcon Alr Base In Greece.</i>
<i>Rlght now,</i>
<i>you're probably fllled...</i>
<i>... wlth all the doubts</i>
<i>In the world.</i>
<i>But I'll tell you somethlng.</i>
<i>God doesn't glve people</i>
<i>thlngs He doesn't want them to use.</i>
<i>And he gave you the touch.</i>
<i>It's a power you have</i>
<i>Inslde of you.</i>
<i>Down there where you</i>
<i>keep your guts, boy.</i>
<i>It's all you need</i>
<i>to blast your way In...</i>
<i>... and get back</i>
<i>what they took from you.</i>
<i>Your dad's slttlng there</i>

<i>If you fly your heart out...</i>
<i>... you can glve hlm one.</i>
<i>It's up to you.</i>
<i>Don't put on thls tape</i>
<i>If you're turnlng back.</i>
<i>Good.</i>
<i>You declded, dldn't you?</i>
<i>All rlght.</i>
<i>Flrst thlng you got to do...</i>
<i>... ls convlnce yourself</i>
<i>that nothlng can stop you.</i>
<i>You got to belleve</i>
<i>that plane you're In...</i>
<i>... ls llke a sult of armor.</i>
<i>Llke an Iron eagle</i>
<i>that nothlng can penetrate.</i>
<i>Now llsten close, kld.</i>
<i>I recorded some stuff to help you</i>
<i>through each part of the mlsslon.</i>
<i>Talk Into your fllght recorder</i>
<i>so there's a record of everythlng.</i>
<i>Don't waste tlme</i>
<i>worrylng about me.</i>
<i>You start thlnklng that way,</i>
<i>you'll mess up.</i>
<i>Pretend I'm In that cockplt wlth you.</i>
<i>We're stlll golng In...</i>
<i>... to knock the shlt</i>
<i>out of them together.</i>
How long to repair your runways?
It could be repaired...
...in less than an hour.
Put every man you have on it.
I want...
...these pigs blown out
of the sky.
Yes, sir.
They're coming for the American.
Inform the prison
to be prepared to move him.
We may need him as a decoy.
I want all anti-aircraft mobilized...
...and I want defense command
to find their planes.
Now!
All right, Chap.
80 miles to Bilyad.
<i>Keep a close eye</i>
<i>on that stores llst.</i>
<i>I thought of somethlng.</i>
<i>If thelr radar dldn't plck us up</i>
<i>through the mountalns...</i>
<i>... then there's somethlng</i>
<i>they may not know.</i>
How many planes.
<i>They won't know</i>
<i>how many flghters there are.</i>
<i>They'll never thlnk It's just you.</i>
<i>So when you contact them,</i>
<i>tell them there's more of you.</i>
<i>Now, they aln't got no MIGs there.</i>
<i>But remember those choppers.</i>
<i>Any of thelr rockets hlt you...</i>
<i>... you'll be llvlng permanently</i>
<i>In them clouds.</i>
<i>Recon showed surface-to-alr unlts.</i>
<i>Watch out for them.</i>
<i>They'll probably expect you.</i>
<i>You know what to do from here on In.</i>
<i>Good luck, man.</i>
This one's for you.
<i>Thls Is Iron Eagle.</i>
I am the flight leader
of an American assault force...
<i>... sent to recover Col. Ted Masters...</i>
<i>... whom you are unlawfully</i>
<i>holdlng prlsoner.</i>
<i>I want Colonel Masters dressed</i>
<i>In hls fllght sult...</i>
<i>... and removed from hls present</i>
<i>locatlon to the alrport.</i>
<i>When he gets there, I want hlm</i>
<i>put In a jeep by hlmself...</i>
<i>... and sent to the end of the</i>
<i>northernmost runway.</i>
<i>I want to see an escort leave</i>
<i>In 2 mlnutes wlth Col. Masters...</i>
<i>... or I'll have my squadron</i>
<i>destroy the flrst...</i>
<i>... of flve strateglc targets...</i>
<i>... beglnnlng wlth your</i>
<i>blggest oll reflnery.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>
Pigs.
I want an armed escort
at the detention center...
...standing by for my orders.
And prepare my car.
I am going to the airport.
I want these people...
...destroyed.
You were right, Chap.
They're not moving him.
Looks like they're trying to stall.
<i>Bllyad Tower,</i>
<i>thls Is Iron Eagle.</i>
We hear you.
He's not being moved.
What's the problem?
They are having trouble finding
a jeep suitable for your purposes.
Bullshit! You got
a whole town full of them.
You just lost a refinery.
All right, Chappy.
Let's see how they feel about
losing 100 million in oil.
I'm just about to the refinery.
I'm going for the tanks.
I wish you could see this.
<i>Looks llke they'll be</i>
<i>lmportlng oll thls year.</i>
That pilot is a dead man.
How much longer
to repair the runway?
At least 10 minutes.
Tell them to move faster
or they'll hang.
And tell them to move
the American now.
I want them to be together...
...when they die.
They're moving him!
See you soon, Dad.
How long now?
Any minute.
Get the mobile units into position,
but out of sight.
No one fires...
...until I give permission.
<i>I'm assumlng they're movlng hlm.</i>
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>what to do anymore.</i>
<i>Remember what I told you</i>
<i>about the Hades bomb.</i>
<i>Land, plck up your dad</i>
<i>and get your butt out of there.</i>
<i>And keep track of your ammo.</i>
<i>I'm rlght there wlth you.</i>
<i>Don't forget that.</i>
Everybody step out!
You, drive to the runway.
Drive to the runway!
Move!
Can you confirm any other planes?
Nothing, sir.
Let him land.
Then...
...cut him to pieces.
Tell him to get ready
on my command.
Goddamn it!
I'm coming down, Dad.
Here I come.
Kill him now.
You son of a bitch!
Everyone out!
Move your troops down the runway.
Finish off the American!
Holy shit!
Attack them through the flames!
The Americans must die.
Or none of you will live
to regret your mistakes.
Is that you?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Can you walk? We haven't got
much time. Come on.
We'll talk later. Come on.
Come on, Dad.
You can make it.
One step and you're home, Dad.
Send me two brave men.
If there are any left among you.
Where's your air support?
I only came in
with Chappy Sinclair.
They took him out
at II Kharem.
Jesus, Dad!
- Can we still fire on the ground?
- I don't know. Why?
Something's about
to have us for breakfast.
They got up some MiGs.
Take off.
We'll fight in the air.
Flight Commander,
this is Col. Nakesh.
<i>Respond lmmedlately.</i>
Which of your squadron
is most heavily armed?
<i>Major Joradl. Fully loaded.</i>
Have him land
on this field at once.
How much fuel?
2100 pounds.
You better get to the Med quick.
Climb as high as you can.
Get down!
Get out of
your flight suit now!
<i>Call up your stores.</i>
Two Sidewinders and 244 rounds.
We'll never reach safety.
We're burning fuel too fast.
We have to take them on.
I guess so.
Think you can you handle a loop?
Think you can handle the music?
One down, one to go.
<i>You may deal dlrectly wlth me now.</i>
Colonel Akir Nakesh.
Then you can deal with me, Doug Masters.
Watch it, son.
Nice shot.
Anything else you want to send over?
<i>Way to fly, Doug.</i>
You are a dead man.
Do you know that?
<i>Turn out!</i>
<i>Steady up, Doug.</i>
<i>Thls guy's an ace.</i>
<i>He knows what he's dolng.</i>
<i>Don't let hlm stay behlnd you.</i>
<i>Move lt, Doug.</i>
<i>Pltch out! Pltch away from hlm!</i>
Time to die, Iron Eagle.
<i>Roll out!</i>
Okay, Dad, I'm taking this guy out.
<i>Stay wlth hlm, Dougle. Stay wlth hlm.</i>
<i>You own hlm.</i>
<i>You can take hlm, Doug.</i>
<i>You can do lt!</i>
<i>That's lt.</i>
<i>Take a steady straln.</i>
So long, asshole.
Dad! More MiGs!
I don't think she can
take much more.
What's our stats?
Only 30 rounds, 800 pounds of fuel.
Too chancy to face them.
Try to outrun them.
I hope you're right.
Taking her to Mach 1.
I can't keep up this speed.
We'll have to slow down or dump it.
We'll have to face them.
I'm ready.
Four more jumping us!
Pull up hard!
<i>Thls Is Blue Leader.</i>
<i>Do you read?</i>
They're ours, Dad!
<i>They're Amerlcans!</i>
<i>Roger, Blue Leader.</i>
I got two bandits on my ass.
Can you assist?
<i>Roger. We're about to contact the</i>
<i>aggressor and verlfy hls Intentlons.</i>
Attention, unidentified aircraft.
This is Major Smiley, U.S. Air Force.
<i>You are followlng one of our F-16s</i>
<i>In Internatlonal alrspace.</i>
<i>Do you wlsh to engage?</i>
I didn't think so.
<i>The MIGs do not wlsh to engage</i>
<i>at thls tlme.</i>
<i>Were you able to retrleve</i>
<i>Colonel Masters?</i>
He's here with me, Major.
<i>Congratulatlons. Welcome home.</i>
We were worried about you since we
got the mayday from Col. Sinclair.
We thought you went down with him.
Did you find the wreckage?
Only parts of it.
<i>Scattered all over the Med.</i>
<i>We'll escort you to Ramsteln Alr</i>
<i>Force base In West Germany.</i>
We have a fuel problem.
Don't worry. There's a fuel tanker
standing by.
Major?
Can we fly the Missing Man formation for
Colonel Sinclair?
<i>We're already In posltlon.</i>
<i>We'd be honored If you'd</i>
<i>ease up front and take the lead.</i>
Chappy wanted me to play this for you
as soon as we were safe.
<i>Good mornlng, Col. Masters.</i>
<i>Thls Is Col. Chappy Slnclalr.</i>

<i>Hope you feel good.</i>
<i>You'll be home soon.</i>
<i>I don't have to tell you</i>

<i>Thls kld comes up to me one day and</i>
<i>tells me he's got a problem...</i>
<i>... and could I help hlm.</i>
<i>He was a cocky guy,</i>
<i>kept telllng me how good he could fly.</i>
Nice of you to join us for the occasion,
Mr. Iron Eagle, sir!
They told us you went down in the Med.
I did. I had to do
a little dog paddling...
...until I got picked up
by an Egyptian trawler.
Your dad said it didn't go
easy for you either.
- Is Dad coming to this?
- He's still in debriefing.
It's just you and me, kid.
They're going to put us in jail.
You know that, don't you?
Whatever they do, keep your head up
and your shoulders back.
They like it when you stand tall.
Stand at ease.
I've read the statements of all
the principals...
...involved in this
highly irregular operation.
You both stand accused of violating
virtually every section...
...of the National Security Act.
The penalty for such violations
could incarcerate you...
...for the next 25 years.
Have any idea of the consequences
of your actions?
If the details came to light...
...it would undermine public
confidence...
...in this branch of military service.
What the hell were we supposed to do?
No one lifted a finger to help my dad.
Mr. Masters...
...have you given any thought...
...to the penalties
that could be imposed on you?
Yes, sir, I have.
And were those thoughts pleasant?
No, sir.
I'm glad. Keep them in mind.
Because if you talk
about this operation to anyone...
...l'll guarantee you those penalties
will be imposed immediately!
Does this mean you're letting us go?
This means your release
is conditional on your silence!
I urge you to re-evaluate that decision.
Letting this boy loose
would be a big mistake.
He's already demonstrated his
inability to keep his mouth shut.
I'd suggest
sending him to an institution...
that can order him to keep...
...that big mouth shut!
Are you saying we should confine him to
some sort of penal facility?
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes, sir.
You see, Mr. Masters has applied
to the Air Force Academy...
...an institution well-suited
for this treatment.
Unfortunately, his application
has met with some resistance.
I was wondering if you could...
This aircraft, by order of the President
of the United States...
...has just arrived from Ramstein
Air Force Base, West Germany...
...where Col. Ted Masters was recovering
from the rescue operation...
...which freed him from his captors
three days ago.
As reported earlier, the Air Force
sent a squadron of F-16s...
...to mount a crippling attack on
hostile forces.
The operation resulted
in no American losses...
...enemy casualties
were termed as minor.
In fact,
details of the entire mission...
...have been strictly classified
by the State Department.
Col. Masters is followed by Air
Force Reserve Col. Charles Sinclair.
Sources close to the Air Force
have uncovered a rumor...
...that Colonel Sinclair aided
in planning the rescue attempt.
However, we've done some local
investigating...
...and find this to be highly unlikely.
The young man who has come out is
Master's son, Doug...
...who accompanied his father home.
As you can see,
he seems to have quite a following.
Incidentally, Doug has received
an appointment...
...to the U.S. Air Force Academy
in Colorado this fall.
He'll follow in his father's footsteps
and take orders from the Air Force.
He's quite a capable young Cessna pilot.
I'm sure he can't wait for the thrill of
flying more advanced Air Force jets.
For Channel 6, this is Jeff Tamblin.
Back to you in the studio.
You did it, man! Unbelievable!
You pulled it off!
All right!
Eagle!
I forgot to give these back to you.
Keep them. You've earned them.
