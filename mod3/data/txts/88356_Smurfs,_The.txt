There is a place ...
who knows no sorrow.
It's even fun, if you do feel bad.
A place that is occupied
by three large apples, blue creatures.
It lies in an enchanted forest,
hidden behind a medieval village.
Most people believe that this place
only in children's books or children's fantasy occurs.
We want to talk.
Come on.
I'm going down.
It's hard to breathe at this speed.
We love to fly.
I'm so excited.
Now you see us ...
And now.
- Wait.
I love Smurf Berries.
The blue are mine.
BLUE MOON FESTIVAL.
I'm so late for rehearsal.
The Smurf Village  plays every
Smurf his own role.
Klungelsmurf ...
- Sorry, Craft Smurf.
No matter.
- Klungel, watch out.
This gives the Smurfs a sense of harmony.
Sorry about your cakes.
- Do not worry, Klungel.
And calm.
We have Craft Smurf, the builder.
And Baksmurf.
- Hey, Smurf Glasses.
I practice for the festival.
Delicious pizza.
- Sorry, Koksmurf.
I'm frozen pizza
invented. Genius.
Hi, Klungel.
- Hey, guys.
Who's wrong clumsy?
- What do you get when you got a Smurf
with 'cross a cow?
Blue cheese.
I have a gift for you.
No thanks. I'm late for rehearsal.
- Wait, I ...
Hi, murmur. Hi, Mc Smurf.
- Whoa, easy on you.
This Is not the repetition of 's Festival?
- You're not on the list.
It's there.
- Yes, under 'let Klungel not enter'.
You apparently have the skills
not explain this well.
Here we go.
- The rest does not want to dance with you ...
neat because said fractures.
How can anyone think that now?
That leaves a big bruise behind.
Beautiful, amazing ...
Truly formidable.
Stop, stop.
It's a dance, not a knock.
Make a ripple.
- Okay, do not get the stress.
So happy and perfect it in life
Smurf Village is also ...
even have sunshine and butterflies
have their dark clouds.
Smurfs And that cloud has a name:
Gargamel, the evil wizard.
Sing a happy song.
This is so wrong.
I am Papa Smurf.
I am the head of
a small group of blue people ...
and I live in the forest with 99 sons
and a daughter.
Completely normal.
And I am Smurfette,
and I find myself so beautiful.
I cheated Gargamel
and I do not care.
I care only about sunshine and rainbows.
But that will soon change.
I said: That will soon change.
Azrael, that's your sign.
That's your cue that you do
friendly creatures to pulp hits.
Good, but not too wild.
These are the only dolls I have.
I have no obsession with Smurfs.
I keep every day and every hour
those wretched beings think.
Because I need them.
Because of their blue, joyful substance ...
My magic is finally ...
not infallible.
Unbeatable. Thank you.
I am the most powerful magician in the world.
You are milking it. Do not.
Oh, great?
- Yes, deceptive terrible Smurfette?
You're searching for years for the Smurfs.
How do you find us?
I'm glad you asked,
because I have a magic card ...
that shows me exactly where the
Smurfs route.
And I'm going to use my great power
us here to carry.
Come, my little fish eating friend.
Alla Kazoem.
Great.
My God, Azrael, you're a boy?
I really need that substance Smurfs.
Alla Kazam.
It's that time of the Blue Mon
Time for Smurfs magic and visions.
To see what the future
has in store for us.
I have to drink to make up the vision.
Magic is strongest at the blue Mon
Insofar as good, much laughter and gesmurf.
Bungler is quiet, it is always good.
A dragon staff.
Bungler ...
Bungler, what have you done?
Hi, Papa Smurf.
- Klungel.
Everything good?
- Yes, everything was fine.
Why are not you practicing
to celebrate the blue moon?
A couple of guys got a slap in their face,
So I do what Smurf Mud compresses.
To everyone swelling care.
Papa Smurf, Smurf you have no more fruit.
I'll pick some.
No, those fields are too close to
Gargamel Castle. I pick it.
You stay in the village and
out of trouble, understand?
If you say so.
The visions are always true.
I can not let this happen.
"Stay in the village, Klungel."
If they see all the Smurf Fruit,
they will be so proud of me.
A few more.
Boe.
- Gargamel.
Brave cat.
A spool of thread.
Sweet kitten.
That is it.
It is invisible, the dirty ...
Wait.
I need to know if it is safe.
Azrael, you're dead?
What you saw in your vision, Papa Smurf?
Nothing destructive.
Everything is just fine.
Perfect, another year without
worry about those mean old ...
Gargamel.
- I know who she meant.
No, Gargamel.
I got him by accident
led to the village.
Run for your life.
- Faster everyone.
The forest.
Loud alarm, Lol.
Kitten, here.
Come on.
There, you nasty cat.
This way.
- Watch out.
No, irritating nature.
Papa Smurf, you primitive
security system is useless to me.
I laugh it off.
How do you find these primitive, Gargamel?
This blows over soon, I need this
straight. I just need to think.
Follow me, everyone.
- NOT THIS WAY
Hide yourself.
Bungler, you're going the wrong way.
- He goes to the forbidden waterfalls.
And the blue Mon
- Stop him, Smurfs.
Incredibly, we warn him once.
Is it still wrong.
He is also a difficult question.
- Excruciating pain, rising?
Someone who reads signs?
- This is a difficult issue.
He makes me a bit.
So there are still about 99 smurfs.
This is not good.
Help.
We tried. We go.
- We make a Smurf bridge to get you.
This is not really a bridge Smurfs, a ... more
- Smurf closed, glasses.
Blue Mon
What happens, Papa Smurf?
Oh no, the vision.
Watch out for the hole.
- It's more like a vortex, a portal.
It's a target.
I think you draw the short straw.
Now you are mine.
Next time, Gargamel.
What's wrong with you?
- That was amazing. Again.
Are you crazy? We were almost dead.
We are not even wet.
- What part of the enchanted forest is this?
According to my calculations ...
It's slimy.
I think we're no longer in Smurf Village.
Smurfs, you must see this.
- What is it?
Why listen to him?
Through him we were through a hole sucked.
It's not a hole, but a vortex.
- To the rock was not sure?
Oh my Smurf.
- Where are we Smurf?
By the Smurfs Creek without paddles.
Here we are.
They are at least not after us.
Azrael.
- Run.
Azrael, you're dead?
I must have Smurfs.
We come back if it is safe.
- Come on.
I come through.
- I get hungry.
Good to see you.
Enjoy the party.
The photographer there?
There's something great going on.
Welcome.
Ladies, looking good. Not only
stand for the board, but next to it.
There you have it product.
And can also laugh.
You work for a cosmetics line.
If so, laugh and enjoy.
Thank you.
Hello, Henri.
Are you on top of the campaign, Patrick?
- As good as I can.
We have done our homework,
and tested ...
She points at me.
- That can not be good.
It is downright amazing.
- There is the new vice president of marketing.
Scott have you fired?
- He gave me what I wanted, not what I wanted.
Can you give me what I want?
- Ask why you?
How do I know I am asking if I
do not even know what I want?
Nicely put, that's why you need me.
Precisely, create a new campaign
for Jouvenel.
Digital, so you're on time for launch.
I have only two days.
- Yes, without delay. Problem?
No, for a new campaign and tight.
But two days is perfect.
God had only six days needed for the world.
- Then go enjoy working for him.
Where are we, Azrael?
What is this vague realm?
Another box of investigations.
Can you a taxi, please?
We just jump back into the portal
to our village and everyone is happy.
Yes, guys, keep Smurfmistisch.
- I'd rather Pessismurfig.
We're all dead.
- How do we get home? The portal is closed.
If the blue moon tonight shining
open the portal again.
Now let's hide until night.
- We Smurfs.
But I'm not happy.
- Azrael.
Suit. The tree.
- Up.
My hair. Back, cat.
Well done, Smurfette.
Sacrifice yourself for the group, Klungel.
Bungler.
- Quickly, to the mechanical vehicle.
Why not go around the tree?
Of course, sit sunning.
My missing Smurfs could be anywhere.
What? Where?
- Come on, stop there.
You're too old for this.
- Stop it, go through.
7th Street, please.
I do not like those heights.
- Do not look down.
Come back.
- Fast.
Because of this height to jump,
it is not better.
My hip.
- Gargamel!
Come on, go.
- Wait, I forgot my phone.
Never mind, I got it.
I saw that all coming 30 years.
- Smurfs!
Castles and palaces everywhere.
And green gnomes.
- Red And trolls.
And look at that giant princess.
This town is amazing.
- Yes, and perhaps dangerous.
Until we have Klungel and go home,
we stay together, and you do what I say.
If you say so.
- You can count on us.
They can see us. Camouflage.
Unnoticed.
Our stop. We go.
- Another tree climb to the top.
I hope Klungel can breathe in that box.
How do we find there Klungel?
- I can make calculations Smurf.
We look through every window.
- I do not do windows.
We will Smurfs.
- Every window?
Nothing.
Grace, you'll never guess.
They have 0% fat pizza was invented.
- No, but that's a good idea.
They found a ...
Oh, the baby kicked.
Hi.
- Hi. Please say hello.
Hey, monkey.
So my voice sounds.
Hello, son or daughter.
Hello.
This is not your voice but that of a robot.
Our children are friends with the toaster.
Whether the new V.P. Marketing.
- My God.
It is on trial. If I Cruella happy
make this new project ...
I love the job. I'll end with my
head on a spear next to my predecessor.
'll Be fine. You got me.
- It must be in two days.
What if I do not succeed?
- You can not come to the echo.
Unless ... Wait.
We have backup teams.
If I use them and work around the clock.
Azrael, we have come so far.
And the same mystery continues to haunt me.
How do I find the Smurfs?
If only I had ...
Sorry, disturbs my mind
You disgusting gebraak?
If I had anything from them, a drop of spit.
A piece of fingernail.
If only one hair, then I had some
Smurfs magic exercise.
Very nice, are you ready?
I do not want to watch.
What?
Gadver, what now?
Is that ...? No, I can not.
It is the locomotive of Smurfette.
Sweet ambrosia follicles.
Silk strings of luck.
Mixed with a reasonable
amount of cat vomit.
Yes, I'm a genius.
With my powerful magic, I have this
lokje enough to catch them all.
I need a lab to find the magic
from these precious locks to pick.
Yes, a little small
but it will be fine.
It even has a toilet.
What is die?
Open ...
Someone very dark and there
terrible magic practices.
What is that?
Baby, Daddy's home.
Come on.
- Papa Smurf, I know 613 blue ...
and the moon is no.
- Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal once it is opened,
may again be opened.
How do we open a magic portal,
Klungel if we do not even find?
I think I see something.
Bungler, is that you?
Hello.
Berry Explosion.
Patrick.
I am sure that the box is.
- Wait till I got hold of him.
Smurfs.
- What is it?
No.
No, have you done?
Come on, guys.
- Lift this way, all together.
Wait.
- What now?
What happened to Klungel happened?
- They have eaten him for sure.
Hide.
Rancid.
That Klungel.
- Attack, Smurf.
Sorry, sorry.
- This is for Klungel.
Please do not hurt me,
I just want to go home.
Talked to you just say?
I do not say anything to you that large
spiky thing away does.
Bungler, make yourself known.
- Klungel, where are you?
Come on out.
- Are you there?
Go away.
Go back to the sewer.
You can kiss my Smurf.
- Where did you Klungel?
The giant is me.
Right here.
So you're blue and you ...
Jeez, are you?
This way.
- Klungel, where are you?
Other way.
- Come on, Smurfs.
Go away.
- Klungel where the Smurf are you?
Grace, I am attacked.
Do not fall for their cuteness.
Indeed.
- It's good.
They are friendly.
You're lucky that you have Lassie, I had
almost stew made your insides.
This is it, Azrael.
The hair of Smurfette is this,
and finally I have my Smurfinator.
It's a masterpiece.
Want a breath mint when finished?
This is my magic elixir more potent
than all the measurable ...
Measurable indeed.
This gives me the strength drop
to catch them all.
This is great.
Smurf the whole day. Next time it
feels right, start to laugh.
Good things will happen to you ,
So lets begin the Smurfs.
It is so obvious that you do it wrong.
- Really?
How crazy is this? Little blue men
in our kitchen are singing.
So you maintain that this really happening?
It says this mythical beings
from Belgium, also known as Schtroumpf.
Documented by Peyo.
- They bring good luck as leprechauns in Irish.
It says that the myths, Grace.
I'm so sorry, sir.
- I think they really exist.
Okay, you come from an enchanted forest and
live in large mushrooms?
And you will be haunted
by a magician ...
and are trapped in New York
the blue moon?
And you use the imprecise term
Smurf for just about everything.
Smurfcies.
And you are all named
to your personality?
Then get your name at birth or
when your own character?
Whatever.
Surely there must be something out there about the
blue moon in your window magic machine?
What is this magical search engine?
- Now I use Google.
Google.
The blue moon occurs when we have two
full moons in a month.
It is an illusion,
just like you.
But the moon itself does not appear blue.
- What?
Now we will never get home.
- No reason for panic.
If we want to go home I just have a
make the drink blue moon mimics.
Hear that, honey? They keep up
a real blue moon rises ...
what happens when the small, blue santa
that 's potion making.
Want a bite?
- No, thanks.
Of course, the stars are
to stand in line.
And when it is difficult to estimate
without the right tool.
Mr. Winslow, may I have your
stargazer borrow?
My what, sir?
- He does not telescope.
This is all my fault.
- We all die.
Enough. Smurf in a panic
is enough.
And Papa Smurf had a vision in which everything
Smurfig alright, right?
Yes, it's all good.
I must find the Smurfs.
Stop your complaining.
If I was a Smurf,
where would I go?
You sir with that tight suit,
have you seen those little blue?
Certainly, what amount are we talking?
- You sell them?
Have you been to the la, baby?
- What la?
In the kitchen, Lilly.
- Who is Lilly?
She's the hottest girl on the ward.
- Please.
What is the temperature of Lilly to make
finding Smurfs?
Take your meds, man.
- What?
Is everyone in this realm completely insane?
Thankfully, the local magician.
Excuse me, Mr. manner,
have you seen those little blue?
They are everywhere.
I knew it.
I told you we were close, Azrael.
Everybody gets one. We need to make sure
Smurf Berries our keep.
Great, we'll stay here long?
- Not long, I have to have a telescope.
A magic book find
a portal Smurfs and we are home.
Quite simply, my little Smurfs.
I'm leaving.
- Someone Smurfig looks good.
Why are you on a leash?
- It's a tie.
Keep it warm your neck?
- That he obviously needed.
Like a smith his iron needs.
- Because everyone wears at work.
What are you, giant slippery?
I convince people to buy things,
by the market to predict.
Predictions, he is a soothsayer.
I want to explain it, but I am too late.
I gotta go, I do not have time.
What? You had an outfit and
Now you wear something completely different.
Smurfette, the other is fixed dirty.
Do not make her shy.
Sorry.
- Thank you we may continue to mushroom.
It is very beautiful.
- I'm glad you like it.
I like the mushroom too,
anyone here wants a bigger mushroom.
But then you are further away.
- Exactly, sister.
I gotta go, I have an appointment.
We have a baby.
We can not leave here,
without an adult.
I'm 546 years old.
- Of course.
She'll be fine.
- I love you.
Bye.
If I were you I would not go anywhere.
- Why not?
Our world can not cope well with
visit other worlds.
Look what happened to E.T. happened.
A film, a moving picture book.
Just stay here, okay?
Great, he's gone and we have
no telescope.
If it is soothsayer, he often looks at the
stars and that is at work.
Good work, Smurf Glasses.
- What are we waiting? We go.
Come on, guys.
- We get that telescope.
Bungler, I think it is better
if you stay here, you know?
You can watch the mushroom.
Yes, that's what I thought.
This way, Smurfs.
- Follow Mr. Winslow.
I can mushroom into account is watching.
We Smurfs him out of this tent.
- Is he down?
Can you see him?
- He goes into the mechanical vehicle.
This distance is clearly too large.
- There you go.
Taxi. From below.
- Here we come.
Use your hat, silly.
- Did not climb the stairs?
That was pretty funny.
Hold on tight, we stop.
- Not to me, murmur.
Did I do that? Sorry.
- Keep the change.
We really need your help.
- What are you doing here?
We need a telescope,
you understand that?
You can not come abroad.
- Who are you talking?
We want to see your prediction space.
- We want to go home.
I should just leave.
- Well, come here. All.
Careful.
- I'm not going to.
Silence.
- It's dark here.
Who 's Smurf left?
Hey, get your hand off my kilt.
- That's my hand.
Good morning.
- Congratulations on your promotion.
I hope you keep drawers ...
- You're late.
Odile, you sat in my office.
We have work to do launch
Jouvenel is tomorrow, your concept is ready?
Almost, I had a weird morning.
- What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just excited about
many ideas for the concept.
And I'm hungry, sorry.
The hunger for success.
Nervous energy.
- That's what goes around above.
I love it,
fear of failure is the best motivation.
Henri.
- Make it right.
You have no idea.
Tomorrow is no scent to do that.
Are you crazy?
I can therefore be dismissed.
I could not even breathe in there,
it smelled of sheep ass.
I'm not a stargazer.
- Sorry, but we have to borrow your telescope.
I have no telescope, okay?
That these people in this century.
And especially not here.
- Not happy.
Sorry, I have to work.
- Maybe we can sing to help you.
And to the telescope.
Come on, Smurfs.
Sing a happy song.
Smurf the whole day.
stop.
- Sing a happy song.
Find one that song a little annoying?
- I find it annoying.
What you sing it at work?
- I do not sing at work.
What?
- And he needs a belt.
I know, what if we hum?
Please, stop humming.
Guys, I have a message.
- I know one: Eat with your mouth closed.
Papa Smurf has taught us that.
- It is good that you can use.
Or dance and be merry.
- Grab life by the grapes.
Turn that frown around.
- Always Bet on blue.
Have a Smurfige days.
- I kissed a Smurf, and I liked it?
These are treasures, this is invaluable.
- Thank you.
Mr. Winslow, you know that the message
good when it comes from the heart.
However, Smurfs?
- Absolutely.
Welcome to my world.
I love so forth
out in the smoke.
It makes me feel like I
so wonderfully mysterious am.
And it gives the skin a beautiful glow.
What? Where?
Ah cursed, so close.
What?
Upside, which have suckers
wrong to paint.
Come, Azrael.
Hello.
- What are you doing?
Add a little green.
- That is so sweet.
That's sweet, but I do not think
can grow it here.
We'll see,
Smurfs all have blue fingers.
Where's the rest?
- They get a telescope ...
Papa Smurf so a blue moon
Smurfs and can go home.
Are they gone without you?
- Yes.
But who knows why.
Sorry.
Let's go inside.
Smurfs, where are you?
Every woman looks
so young and vibrant.
Almost magical.
- Amazing.
I see no transformation,
drink that has no power.
Excuse me?
- It's still no face.
This is my mother you're talking about.
- Sorry, I did not realize that.
What a pity for you for 30 years.
Henry, let this fool bring out.
- Crazy?
Security.
- I am the big Gargamel, crazy.
Can this crazy?
Alla Kazoem.
You're young again, Mom.
How did you do that?
Seriously, I'm next.
Sorry, but fools or wizards
never reveal their secrets.
Come Azrael, where are my Smurfs?
No, do not go.
I need to know what you just did.
I do not say anything.
- Can you do it again?
You may try to persuade me.
- What is it you want?
Wealth, fame, fortune?
With my help the whole world ...
know the name, it's Garbage.
Gargamel.
Yes, with my help the whole world
Gargamel the genius grant.
Sorry, did you just genius?
I may sometimes cause an accident,
but because we came in your mushroom.
And we know you and Patrick.
You're so sweet, and I know the feeling.
I'm so clumsy.
I used to anyway.
- Really?
Yes.
- How long did it take for ...
You stand your standing?
Long enough to figure out
that someone is not just a thing.
You can be who you want to be.
Heroic Smurf.
- Yes.
You can not.
Help me out here with me.
- I'll show you.
Works every time.
What a fascinating wind machine
have you here.
Hi, Patrick.
- Grace, help.
They are everywhere and do not stop singing.
Come get them, I get nothing done.
Gargamel sir, I'll be honest.
Lancome, Clinique, Mac will kill ...
for what you have in that ring.
- Not if you finish them first.
Let's see, we need knights
with shining armor.
Some vomit, and poisoned arrows.
- I like your way of thinking.
And some spears to pin their heads.
- It's all about presentation.
And of course all animal Fri
What, they pay extra for animals?
Is that it?
Go away.
You have a weird sense of humor.
- Go away.
I said, go away.
- Mr. Gargamel, you must assure me ...
you that with my mom again
can do but on a large scale.
If you do that the world will worship you.
- Hear that, Azrael?
Worship, which rolls off the tongue
as meat ...
Pilgrim does not, but cooked bones.
Yes, thank you.
Thank God, a puddle pail.
That Dom Pérignon, which you carry me
save in my bladder.
Here, throw it out the window.
Today, please.
Now, back to business.
- Do we have a deal, sir?
Not quite, dear lady.
Look ...
first I have my Smurfs.
You must understand that Patrick is now much
Stress has, so keep a little quiet.
You have my word,
Smurfs I will not come out of the bag.

As a stargazer, everybody out.

- Are all.
Hey, I'm walking here.
Jeez.
- Please wait.
Jeez.
If we are inside we distribute.
And find that telescope.
Hi.
- Patrick, the Smurfs have escaped.
Are you crying?
- No, I need you. Soon they die.
Honey, they're okay. They can give us a
postcard if they shrink back from town.
After they invented paper.
- Patrick, they need you.
Honey.
- I need you, please hurry.
Where are you?
- The man is a fool, it'll never work.
I do not know, he Smoerfen needed.

Azrael every village has an idiot.
What?
Yes, he is.
Stop, thief Smurfs.
Stargazer.
There have been so all unicorns.
I do not mind alone,

Fine, hold on.
Smurf a cannon.
The way to fly.
Perfect.
Smurfabunga.
So, that gives a kick.
There must be somewhere a telescope.
Planet Earth.
Smurf Poo.
These are delicious rancid.
Hello.
Creepy, who were certainly in
Looking for a telescope.
Stargazer, stargazer.

Dangerously high.

Do not you think someone will see us?
- Behave just normal.

I'm coming, guys.
See that ladder climbing toy.
What is that?
I want one too, Mommy.

There is a row.
- Interest in the Goldy IJsdier Oldie?
IJsdier?

I use my grumbling to
hide that I am vulnerable?
Absolutely.
Already on what I thought.
That old witch is all used up.
Keep your home Smurfs battens.
Have you people no limits?
There she is.
- Hey, this dress is mine.
Smurfette.
- Wait, I'm out shopping.
Patrick, please help. There's a giant behind me,
He is huge.
That's mine.
- Sorry, this is not for sale.
Mama.
- Oh really?
Never forget that magic moment
Our worlds met.
And I muttered not really.
Can you please say something?
I'm dying here.
That's one.
Technically, we load cargo on a bear.
- Glasses Smurf, just pull.
Hey buddy, what are we waiting for?
I'll help.
Eager beaver.
- Oh no, they think we are toys.
Hang on guys, it is Grizzly.
We're going to fall.
- Hold down the telescope.
Come on, Smurfs.
- Come, sit.
I did so at our speed.
- I think we lost them.
The hat again.
- I told you love him.
Where did you learn to drive?
- Think you can do better?
Yes, I think I can do better.
- Yes, Gotcha.
Slacker, legged.
Grace, that's Gargamel.
No, you again.
Keep your hands off me.
Oh I hate that guy.
Gargamel.
- Smurfette, more beautiful than ever.
Gargamel, you're us again
outwitted.
Azrael, what are you doing?
Get out of my Smurfs Piston.
Let me help you.
- BLOWING.
Thank you.
Patrick, impressive.
- Thank you.
I'll get the telescope.
- I take the Smurfs.
That's him, he took it so my back.
Blowers Thief.
Get up, you get to the office.
- Do not touch me.
Resistance can not.
- Get off me.
Or feel the wrath of the mighty big ...
Let's see.
How can you be the only girl in the village?
I'm not by a
stork as the rest.
Gargamel has made me to
other Smurfs to catch.
What happened?
- Papa Smurf saved me.
He did a spell for me Smurf
to which I am supposed to be.
Play it safe.
Wait for your approval, then it may
to the billboard rental.
All or nothing.
Papa Smurf had to be ready.
- Yes, enough with that tension.
I want to go home.
- Me too.
Now the weird wizard us on the track,
get the story somewhat differently.
Without that blue moon, we have been.
It's done, and four or
are unemployed.
What is it?
- It will be good.
He's hyperventilating Smurf.
- Yes, tell me about it.
We will break from all that waiting.
- Yes, I know the feeling.
Better yet, I know the cure.
He has the colors under
control those buttons.
Now you.
Catchy.
I also want to try.
- Look at me guys, I'm swinging.
Rufus, G Simmons.
Never mind.
Smurfette is a beautiful treasure.
- She has me so on one knee.
There is only one girl Smurf, and she looks ...
- To me.
is complete. - Surrender.
To the force. - From our family.
May I make a wish and close your eyes
É  and, two, three.
I'm a Smurf.
Come give me a little kiss.
- Here on the cheek.
Bungler, rocking you through the roof.
- Klungel, dances.
Come on, legged.
Indeed.
- Careful.
Feasting in the Smurf.
Nice.
- Thank you.
Hey guys, what do you
my new dress?
The journey here?
Not quite what I had in mind.
Do you what I think?
Sorry, guys.
- Yes, it cools things off.
Nothing as good as a cold breeze
my enchanted forest.
She gives permission for the ad.
- Was she pretty?
Well, said she approved.
For her is beautiful.
Great Patrick.
Shall I send? I do it.
- Yes, do it.
This morning, at any
billboard in New York.
Congratulations.
- Well done, Mr. Winslow.
Boys, Papa Smurf is back.
- Are your calculations done?
We are almost without Smurf Berries.
- It's harder than I hoped.
But we will still go home, right?
- Of course.
Just not tonight.
Now to bed.
I had hoped my mushroom
to sleep tonight.
I miss the other Smurfs.
- Me too.
I have never spent a night away from home.
- Well, last night then.
But who can sleep?
Quiet, quiet now smurfs.
Everything will be fine.
Papa Smurf, do you really think we're
coming home to the other Smurfs?
Do not worry, we will soon
back to the others.
If the stars were now but in a line.
You know who I miss?
Koksmurf, Farmer Smurf, Lolsmurf.
Gourmet Surf, Craft Smurf.
Painter, Bakker.
- Music Smurf.
I miss Smurffatje.
Always has nice things to say.
Who I am not wrong furious Smurf.
He's nice
but if he does, you feel bad.
Another worthless Smurf-free night.
Hello little moth, perhaps with
your help I can get them back
You and I are unique spirits, small.
Both intended to see.
Go now ...
and bring me an army
eagles to free me.
Fly, fly and bring me your brother.
Fly.
Okay, look.
I think you have
a long evening for you.
You drink coffee?
- Is an Ass Smurf blue?
Tell me, that weird guy in the bathrobe ...
at the toy store?
- Gargamel.
He's not really a wizard?
- Not the smartest wizard ...
but just as dangerous.
Thanks.
At home I had two spells
solve ...
but here without my books
and potions.
Well, today we were lucky.
But next time, who knows?
- What will you do?
I'll do everything to my
Smurfs home.
I will never give up.
They are my family.
And you can never give up your family.
Sometimes it makes you nervous?
All those little men who count on you.
What if you screwed up?
How do you know when you're ready?
Come to Papa Smurf's lap.
Right, forget it it.
- Probably not a good idea.
Let me ask you this, why did you
for us back when you called Grace?
She needed me.
I could hear in her voice.
And that's what a smurf is
if you need it then you.
And you know what
do not come here.
It comes from here,
where it is most important.
My spleen?
No, your heart, I try
something clear.
You're a good father, Papa Smurf.
- That you become too.
What do you do?
Enter the weight here.
Come on, stupid moth,
where are my eagles?
You know what happens to someone
on my couch?
Go away idiot, because I am
a war ...
eagles and have called on me
to free from this confinement.
Get up, Grandpa.
There you go.
No one close to Gargamel.
My glorious army of ...
Flying?
I asked not to fly, you idiot.
All right, but fly up.
Up, vermin.
Goodbye, bastards.
Not again.
Please, take me with you.
Wait.
In my castle, for more substance.
Here they come.
Very nice gesmurft, if I do say so myself.
- Come, Elliott here, good boy.
Bungler.
- Blue fingers.
This is incredible.
- I think there is too much pink.
Just because you called murmur,
You do not always complain.
Hi, High 5. High 4.
- High 4.
Great news. According to the stars' t
perfect time to make a Smurf blue moon.
Smurftastisch.
- I have never doubted.
But it must be done tonight.
Between the star and the first high-Mon
That's our only chance.
But we need a spell in this
world works to access the portal.
Master Winslow, a question.
Sell ??them here somewhere spells?
No.
- Preparation them somewhere potions?
Yes, no.
- And old books?
There is an antique bookstore
close to work.
Dr. Wong.
- Perfect, it does.
Hear that?
We're almost home.
Almost home.
Cuddly Smurfs.
I love you.
Come join us, great friend.
- Yes.
You can do it.
- Cuddly Smurfs.
Come here, buddy.
- What is that?
I love you all.
Look. We do not make blue moon,
We already have one.
Really?
- Look, there he is.
No, that's not him.
Smurfette is right.
Look at the blue Mon
That's the wrong ad.
What has happened to my office?
- We have made a baby.
Another Cuddly Smurfs.
- No, this is not happening.
Someone has to yesterday
advertising driven.
Who has been sitting on my computer?
I might stumble.
You just let me fire.
You have sent the wrong file.
Patrick, he ...
- What should I do, Grace?
You said they brought happiness,
this is more accidental.
This should never have happened.
I had no say.
I never wanted that little men
would run around here.
Little blue ...
What are you doing?
- I'll try to save my job.
We would never bother.
The Smurf very sorry.
Do not say anywhere on Smurf.
What does it mean?
You can do your words fit.
- You see.
Wait, Patrick.
Just listen to me.
- What?
I'm so sorry about your job and I hope
that you be able to solve ...
but you see the big picture here.
Look around you and see what
happening now.
Of all the people in the world,
they came to us.
They have chosen us.
Can not you see how great that is?
This happens only once in your life.
This is our blue Mon
And if you do not stop to see,
are you going to miss.
Come on.
There must be somewhere
some substance in it.
Not now. What?
Well done, my little friend.
And to think that I
you almost had eaten.
Come on, Azrael.
We need to find Patrick.
He will lead us to them.
Is there any button that you can put it out?
Tomorrow?
Really.
If this ad does not go away now,
I have no job tomorrow.
THIS RULE OTHERWISE YOU RELEASED
Smurf me.
BABY'S FIRST PHOTO
Which way to the bookstore, Brillié?
According to the navigation we take the
Metro China Country. - Chinatown.
Whatever.
- Here it is.
Come on, everybody. We must take this.
- Are we sure?
Not happy.
Come on, Brillié, leave at the end
of these samples to vehicle.
Is it safe?
- Of course.
That was great.
I hope that we soon find,
because I see ....
In Smurf Name. I thought we
Bungler had left.
It smells like butter.
- Where do those magical bookshop then?
I am too old for this.
It looks creepy here.
- No, not weird but different.
I do not like it.
- Let's address book and get out of here.
You're right, the book of spells
is our ticket home.
I am a wizard with a simple desire
to infinite power and domination.
But why should that be so difficult
Excuse me. Mr. Wise.
Where did you hear that annoying music?
It was those little blue men, she
went into the bookstore.
That song is really annoying.
- Partially excited.
That's not him.
Look at all those wonderful books.
It must be here somewhere.
It is not.
You see something, Smurfette?
- Not from here. Watch out.
I have something.
- Well done.
Here he comes.
Well done.
"The history of the Smurfs'.
That's us.
- Yes, this is the book.
Look at it.
Oh my Smurf.
The secret rooms are hidden
in the drawing.
Is it all in here?
Look at the examples on this page.
Open.
You're right, Azrael.
This is for me.
It's just very naughty.
We need tonight to the waterfall and
This casting spells.
Can we go home?
- Then we can go home.
You are indeed going home.
A place I call Reedevleb castle.
Substance and you will finally be mine.
The dragon staff.
- No.
Allow me.
It's Gargamel!
- Get out.
This is too easy, small Smurfjes.
What is hunting without tension.
We gotta go. Run.
Faster.
Brillié, take the spell it.
Brewing the drink and smurf the moon tonight.
It must be tonight.
I? The moon Smurfs. Not ready.
- You have to be.
Whatever happens, do not come to me again.
- Papa Smurf, no.
What are you waiting for, Gargamel?
- Come on, Dad.
Go now.
- Papa Smurf. No.
We need to continue. Do what Smurf said.
- Papa Smurf.
Is that all you got, Gargamel?
What will happen to Papa Smurf?
Papa Smurf said we need the moon Smurfs
and that is exactly what we do.
Come on, we do not have much time.
Come on, where?
- How do we get Klungel?
With a lift. Come on.
We're still in us.
- I do not think they are friendly.
I am not.
- But they carry their illness.
Smurfs Come, let's fly.
Come on.
I do not know if I can.
- You can, Brillié.
According to my calculations, this is dangerous.
It's getting dark.
- Yes.
We can look better.
Where are the others?
- I'm still in the bookstore.
Listen, I am Grace ...
Hi, Odile.
Patrick.
Listen, before you dismiss me.
I know that advertising is not advertising
that I had sent.
That whatever I had to send.
I almost had sent.
But I did not, because ...
I doubted myself.
I gave you that I thought you wanted
instead of what I thought that was good.
But this is good.
It means something to me, and I think
for others it means something.
It is not just a moon ...
It is a blue Mon
Once in a Blue Mon
This means that only a few moments
in your life that are memorable.
That something magical happens to you.
And if you doubt, or ...
afraid,
you might miss.
That's what that image means.
Let the "blue moon" moments do not
pass you by.
I'll call you back to tell you
you're fired.
That's so Smurfig you.
Prepare for impact.
- The window is open though.
They are out of control.
Watch out for ...
Thank you, bird.
- We have the spell.
Where's Papa Smurf?
- Gargamel him.
What?
- He took him to the castle Reedevleb.
He goes ...
- Do not say it.
What is that? - He takes him to
Belvedere Castle in Central Park.
His substance to escape.
- What?
We have to go get him.
- No, Gargamel is more powerful than ever.
Papa Smurf said, whatever happens
we can not reach him.
He tries to protect us.
- No, we can not leave him.
We have promised.
- No, we can not do.
We have promised
that we would do what he said.
That's right.
- I do not.
I have promised him nothing.
- Me neither.
And I'm not leaving without Papa Smurf.
Patrick, wait.
We go with you.
I'm with you.
- Me too.
Nobody is left behind, not you
and not Papa Smurf.
All for one and one for a Smurf.
I shave you and squeeze you,
and your substance is mine.
Very impressive, my dear little
Papa Smurf.
Look.
But a little bit of your being
gives me so much substance.
Imagine how many I can get
your whole family.
Behold my big strength.
No. The cages.
I get the substance out of their sweat, drop out
their tears and cut out their hair.
You're an idiot, Gargamel.
Smurfs are my home now.
Oh, yes. Let's storm the castle.
Look at this.
We all know the plan yet?
- Let us put our best for Smurf.
Brillié, what happens?
I have the ingredients made
it's more powerful than I thought.
I do not think I can.
- Brillié, you can. Just say the spell.
Aletowa blutunune.
Word Blue.
Oh my Smurf.
I did it, Papa Smurf.
I do not think so.
- It is Angelou Mon
How did she do that?
I do not want you to worry.
It kills not,
it only makes me stronger.
Hey, Gargamel. Come and play outside.
Our little guests have finally arrived.
- No.
Enjoy your ride.
And remember, keep your hands and feet
in place.
Smurfs, run.
You have our smurf, get ready
gesmurft to be.
Yeah, what he said.
How cute, their two small smurfjes
Beloved Papa Smurf rescue.
Gargamel. Make it for only 3.
And I went home and got some
made friends with them.
Jeez.
I think the whole village is here.
What shall I do,
with all this substance?
After my boys.
Fire.
There comes a time when every Smurf
should stand ...
for what is good and blue is in the world.
And in New York this evening
the time has come.
Are you this mean?
- Sorry, I do always.
Turn it around.
Go ahead, they can not keep long.
One rotten apple can make a lot of pain.
Gargamel, here is a
souvenir of "The Big Apple.
From the frying pan ...
- And the fire.
I'm too pretty to die.
Papa Smurf.
- Smurfette, no.
What has he done?
You did not for me to come back.
- I'll get you out now.
Smurfette.
- Hold on, Papa Smurf. I'll be back.
Guards.
Attacks.
I go for the attack.
Hold on, Papa Smurf.
No, onions.
Go back, cat.
Come kitty.
Smurfette.
Were you looking for me?
Playtime is over.
Behold my strength.
Smurfette.
- Have you had enough, eh?
I'm now done with it.
You Smurft with the wrong girl.
What happens, Papa Smurf?
- No.
Gargamel!
That suit, cute blue shoe.
- No, Papa Smurf.
Now it's time to put those little blue
wills break. - No.
Smurfs, Papa Smurf look how well his
blue end.
No, Papa Smurf.
No.
You again.
Goodbye.
This ends now.
Gotcha.
- Freedom.
Damn ...
- Hup murmur.
Come back with my wand.
Oh, no.
I got it.
Thus ends the so.
- We're there.
This does not turn out well.
I got it.
Visions always come out.
We got him.
Give me my wand back.
How dare you?
How dare you do this at the
great and mighty Gargamel?
Those damn Smurfs.
Are you dead?
Patrick.
- Hey.
Bungler.
Bungler, you're a hero.
- Am I a hero?
I'm a hero.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly ruined the moment.
Bungler, you little monkey.
- Papa Smurf.
I apologize, Klungel.
I believed more in that than in your vision.
I'm so proud of you, Klungel.
- Thank you, Papa Smurf.
I told I did not cry.
- And now we come from.
Everyone through the portal.
- No time to lose.
Day.
I do not say goodbye,
but I should say something.
Day.
I hated it so much less than I thought.
- Goodbye, murmur.
Do not get me wrong,
I still hate it.
I will not forget this place.
Certainly not with it on.
Bye.
- I have to go back.
Hello, friend.
- I've never had a girlfriend.
I'll never forget.
- Oh, Smurfette, High 4.
High 4, Grace.
Hi, Smurfette.
- And you little hero. Come here.
Hero? Stop it.
Would you say that again?
It feels good.
Goodbye, Grace.
- Thank you Mr. Winslow, you saved me.
You've saved my entire family.
- Actually it was the other.
I must go now.
I have to rebuild the Smurf village.
Your village has given me some ideas.
Come here.
Goodbye, Papa Smurf.
- Goodbye, Papa.
Let's go home.
And so the stranger left the Smurfs
New York City.
And I think they're a bit prettier
left.
a little wiser, what Smurfiger.
And when the portal was closing itself ...
- Seriously, stop it.
Goodbye, New York.
It's Odile.
- Hi, Odile.
Patrick, I called to thank you.
Finally someone has given me what I want.
I think I'm not fired.
So a new job,
a new baby.
And we've made new friends.
If you really want a bigger house ...
- Bigger? Are you crazy?
Then we would have been far apart.
I Smurf you.
