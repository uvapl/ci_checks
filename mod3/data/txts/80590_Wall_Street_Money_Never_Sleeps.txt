Wall Street 2 Money Never Sleeps
Translated by Simply Releases Toppers
Bather, Subzero, Biteme Suurtje
A silk handkerchief.
A tie.
A watch.
A ring ...
a gold money clip,
without money ...
and a mobile phone.
50 cents per day, drawn from
what you've spent in here ...
and a ticket to the Big Apple.
Gekko success, do not come back.
Want to know what the mother
Most bubbles were?
It came out of nowhere.
By chance.
They called it the Cambrian expolsie.
That happened 500 million years ago.
And over the next
70 to 80,000,000 years ...
was the progress of evolution
so fast that we passed.
The human race.
They still can not explain how
it happened but it happened.
Some people say it was a coincidence.
Others according to plan.
But who really knows.
Seven years later
No more sleep.
- You mean, wake up.
Waking up is positive,
sleep is not negative.
It is not my favorite time of day.
- It's the best time of day.
I feel sorry for those who experience it.
The day is not improving.
You go to bed too late
and sleep too little.
What did you do today?
Have I not told you or are you
forgotten. I'm going to Washington this week.
Yes, a new site right?
- About ten days we go into the air.
The whole site should be ready tomorrow.
And what do all those evil liberals
without their daily Shakespeare?
You're a liberal,
Mr. green energy.
No, the only green is money, honey.
Always it's about Wall Street
I'm sick of it.
Come here, sweetie.
- No, what I ever saw you?
Come here.
- No.
In the eighties was Gordon Gekko
The big name on Wall Street ...
Before he was in jail for
dealing and insurance fraud.
He is now presenting a new book,
and what kind.
Called "greed is good '.
He is now with us.
Nice of you are in the program.
Thanks, Mary.
Turn it off.
- Wait.
I must say that your show
a big hit in the box is.
You followed me from jail.
- You show me and a bunch of others.
Have you written a book in prison?
- That's right.
I'm going to shower.
Until next week.
Success in Washington.
Hello.
- Jacob.
Dr. Masters, good morning.
You never sleep?
Jacob, it happened closer than
this, we have not been.
Really? How many lasers?
72 this morning and next week
we try 96.
That's great,
this changes everything.
Let me guess, you want this to continue
and you have more money?
A contribution of 100 million was not gone ...
we would be six months ahead
walk on our schedule.
$ 100,000,000 ...
long as the oil price remains high
we get the money for each other.
That would be nice, say the founders
They have some problems in the market, so ..
Since you do not worry about it.
Build-star Baby you who just can not.
Okay, thank you Jacob.
Fine, talk to you soon.
Hydra, off shore.
Let the repeat.
A large deep-sea research
the coast of Guinea.
This is an oilfield where scarcely
someone has been.
Remember that the shares will trade 31%
Nikkei from 52.
It is partly financed and owned by
none other than ...
Churchill Schwartz.
So we know that there
nothing bad will enable ...
My suggestion is that
we are aggressive. Once?
Does everyone agree?
What do you think, Ed?
I do not agree,
but perhaps lies to me ...
Equaling Guinea is a big dictatorship,
gold and diamond mines have been nationalized.
And what's your point?
That's the risk we would not take.
We have to wait.
- Wait, what?
Your hydro fusion deal?
Now you're talking about something else.
United Fusion Corporations.
That's comparing apples and oranges.
Really?
- Yes.
That deal where we have 50 million U.S. dollars
have to spend?
Alternative energy is what bio technology
was 15 years ago, Stan.
You're young too and profit
not guaranteed, but can be enormous.
We will all be dead if that crazy
Professor of you discovered something.
And that of a man who said Google
was a bubble.
Anyway,
Hydra Offshore ...
a guarantee of 3 to 5 times our deposit ...
and better yet, we all love,
big bonuses.
Perhaps I can,
maybe not.
People tell me things.
Harry, you promised.
You know I know.
All right, Lou?
On a good day I feel good and
a bad one, what is the difference.
Ask no stupid questions anymore.
- You wanted me?
Dave, can you keep an eye on Harry here,
he makes me crazy.
Go along.
Why?
A thank you.
Or do you have a kiss with?
I thought the news from London
maybe ...
Say nothing about London.
Look at their paperwork ...
they say they make 125 million profit ...
For me it looks more like one U.S. dollar and
a penny, so they tell me ...
do not worry,
we earn money with the losses.
How can you make money from losing
You tell me.
I'm just an old dinosaur.
I believe in Keller Zabel.
And you're not a dinosaur.
I have no more fun in Jacob.
I talk to a guy.
Mumbai or Dumbai,
and I do not know what he is talking about ...
I do not know what he sells, or who he is.
I do not know how much I should invest ...
laugh at me while my partners in
their graves.
There are now only machines
tell you what to do.
Why I'm here, Lou.
To your burden.
Aging is not for sissies.
Take that money and spend it but that
beautiful girl of yours. You've earned it.
I remember when you sent them, a lean
guy with a strange hairstyle ...
I still said 'Jimmy, what are you doing?
Give me a real Caddy.
I had a bad day.
And you did not stop. 12 years old,
you started on businesses ...
sectors and earnings.
You're hungry, Jake.
When I smoke it and you've still.
I still have a check
in my hands.
Give it out.
Someone must keep our economy running.
Visit my office.
Thanks.
Princess Cut.
Platinum half carat ...
there is no ring ...
Can you take me
to "the money room '?
You mean the foyer for private customers?
- Yes, that.
This is Olga, from Russia.
- How are you?
She had you all in sight.
Perfect. An elf.
Gizelle is just horny.
- No, but it does.
Really really.
- Yes.
So young and already in the market?
Cheers.
When will you ask her?
- She is not fond of marriage.
Look at Paris.
- They must settle with her father.
Now if you have children?
- Then it gets tough.
Do you have heard what he
said on TV last night?
Home Loan Default, but the first
raindrop of the mother of all storms.
The grapes are sour.
- That man is a legend. Gordon Gekko.
I heard him next week
a lecture.
Watch where you walk.
- Dude, take a taxi.
Join us after work.
- No, I can not. Winnie, you know.
You worship Zabel.
- He has a regular place for me.
It is said that he is a ton of debt.
Billions, they can not find bidders.
So what?
It does not matter if it's true or not,
but in this climate ...
it matters what buyers believe.
And winners are credible.
I would bet with you now.
- Go ahead.
I've got one million as a bonus.
Tomorrow afternoon can be yours.
KZI you invest in shares.
I have so much confidence in this company.
Did you not hear me?
This is the only remaining friend ...
of a place on Long Island,
that nobody knows or can express ...
I must tell you,
you sound like your mother.
Do not,
let her out here.
Why would he give me a bonus,
if we in trouble?
That would not make sense.
You want nothing to earn? Fine.
I'm sure Harry Shapiro
really want.
I'm a whore,
send it on to me.
I'm still young enough to
this again to overcome.
I will count a great commission.
I'd head if I really want to see here
tons of money in tow.
I have no other choice
then run away.
We are facing a never before
showed collapse.
Something I've never seen.
Keller Zabel this year
never lost so much.
This fall could very well be the beginning
of a much larger correction.
It's an incredible story.
Keller Zabel shares fly down.
How come you never
so as you sat next to this time?
You lose all your money at the moment,
I can see it here plummet.
Someone throws big money here.
Zabel shares are on the verge of collapse.
Do you look like?
Your share of its life, Jake.
You're now at 50% loss. I can now
off without you great damage.
In one week its shares KZI
52% had failed.
I know where the share going,
I have before me now ...
You should breathe deeply and your bank
say not to sell the share.
The shares are currently run by,
but the proportion does not.
About three months we are talking about laughing.
You're angry?
I am angry.
I'm fine.
- Relax.
I know you all my life, Jake.
I know when you're fooling yourself.
Robbie, listen to me, Keller Zabel
has been around a long time ...
It is one of the biggest names in
investment banks.
One month per year is no drama.
So we are back at 65%, nothing happens.
Not only the money, the profit margin ...
- Go ahead.
You do not want to hear this.
How much, Robbie?
Yet at least half a dollar.
Give me the green light to sell,
buddy. Now.
Sell.
Robbie, I'll call you back later.
Zabel Have you seen?
Where's Lou?
That did not come.
Answer.
I'm not happy.
How was the day today?
As I said, one day feel
I feel good and a bad one.
Do not ask about my feelings,
which are not relevant.
I wanted you like to talk about
the rumors circulating ...
it is crazy and out of control,
I hear it everywhere.
The world is full of crap.
Some TV character does
if he knows anything.
He sells fear and panic.
Idiots feel great.
They want it to end.
That sells, there are no limits.
Muriel knows how to deal with this,
please note it's her dog.
Lou, I can help you, I seek it out.
You should just tell me.
There is so much that you do not know, Jacob.
- What?
Why the bonus,
why now?
Because I know you.
You wait for something better.
Do not give it all out, use the money.
On one day you wake up and you're dead.
Lou, you should get yourself repacking.
It's all good.
Anyway must run, we have
shares in this company ...
We come here to get through.
- Wedding but Gecko's daughter.
Get children together.
Spend as much time with them,
when they are young. Everything changes.
I can not help if I
do not know what you are talking about ...
We are talking about 15,000 jobs
on the draft.
Someone is behind this,
someone wants to hurt us ...
There is a reason for all
and I want to know how and why?
Do you have that dream of that
energy company in Califonia?
There you will probably not come
but keep the dream is certain.
Because everything else is just noise.
There is more than noise,
it is about 15,000 jobs.
15,000 people is not noise ...
we are on a sinking ship?
- I've never liked that dog.
Are we going bankrupt?
You ask the wrong question.
- What is the right question?
Who does not.
China has been abandoned.
But you said ...
- I know what I said.
Two months, we negotiated with them.
This morning at seven hours, they are
withdrawn, but are just Chinese.
While they negotiate,
the Koreans pulled out.
So you say you have not
have made known?
No, I ask you to give me one weeks time
it.
We still talk with the British
and the Arabs do it again.
This time it's real.
- Lou, we've already heard.
Jesus, Paul. We have lost billions
this week.
If there is no reversal in Sunday evening
the newspaper ...
before Asia opens, Keller Zabel
not do business on Monday.
Tuesday will be 15,000 people
unemployed worldwide.
Lou, you have your bad loans
understated ...
estimates are not credible.
After all these years?
You say this to me?
Three quarters of the bankers at this table ...
same paper,
Keller Zabel and let you fall?
You are all committing suicide.
What do you say Harry?
Going along with this?
If you want us to guarantee Keller Zabel,
we all have to participate.
As long-term capital in '98.
And we will be fenced
the state should have.
Lou, I think we here in private
need to talk.
That's a good idea, Bill.
- One moment, gentlemen.
And the moral hazard, Jack?
If we guarantee Keller Zabel,
Who says this does not happen again?
Vengeful bastard.
Who gives you the right
to speak about moral hazard?
I'm sorry Lou, but there is
an explanation for the world.
It was eight years ago,
but you can not let go, right Bretton?
That's enough, Lou.
I'd like to talk to, Bill.
Jack and Lou separately.
30 people in the last three days
Zabel books by Keller went ...
they still say it is impossible
to find out ...
There may be a gap of 10 trillion
or 200 trillion ...
We can not risk that money,
without a guarantee from the state.
You're this started, Bretton.
- I said, stop, Lou.
Otherwise, this meeting is over, right?
You ask us to take a big risk,
what do you offer?
Under this condition, and adopted
we get a guarantee ...
will Jack, Jules, I, and our partners
advisors.
I am ready for the responsibility
two U.S. dollars per share to take.
Two dollars?
You're mad.
The share, the market for $ 79,
less than a month ago.
Our building alone is worth more
than two U.S. dollars per share.
If only we had more time, Lou.
The board will not accept, I sell
not for two U.S. dollars per share.
The government, if we deal
ensure all ...
can never be a higher price
warrant for your company.
If you're not selling Lou, you bankrupt
explained.
This is now a public spectacle.
No, it is a publicly execution,
which leads you, Bill.
I have built this company itself.
Your departure will be the confidence back.
Who are you to tell me
I need to get out.
You're out, Lou.
However you look at it.
But then rot.
I still prefer my venture opportunities
the bankruptcy court ...
before I sell it to the barracuda.
Then there is nothing more to discuss.
Six.
Three, which is the extreme
if I have to sell to the board.
Five.
- Three.
Fine, then we go for four,
it does not look so pitiful.
Three, and nothing more.
Keller Zabel partner and head of one of the
largest investment firms on Wall Street ...
Lewis Zabel, 75 years himself this morning
thrown for a passing train.
Churchill Schwartz is like a bandit
with public funds.
But Keller Zabel as independent
investment bank, that's how it ended.
The news today about Lewis Zabel
shocks everyone. Howard how are you?
That man was an icon of Wall Street.
He was a mentor to me.
Given the circumstances
under which it happened ...
What does this mean for the people of staff
Keller Zabel?
Who have lost their leader,
financially, they damage.
I heard the network,
I'm so sorry.
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
What is it?
You said you were not long
longer wanted to wait ...
and I love you.
Yes.
I must say
by the circumstances ...
I probably have no job,
and we go bankrupt.
We'll get through it.
Ever at that time
was given to a white criminal.
In 1993 he spent almost eight years
sent to prison.
But now he is here,
So I welcome the man himself ...
the initiate Gordon Gekko.
You are pretty much all in big trouble.
You know it myself yet,
but you are the generation of ninja ...
no income, no job and no assets.
You have much to look forward to.
Blood Money
but then your blood.
Someone reminded me recently to
I would have said, "greed is good '.
But now it seems to have been lawful.
By greed buy my bartender
three houses ...
he can not afford.
He has no money on hand.
By greed finance your parents
their $ 200,000 home ...
for $ 250,000.
With the extra 50,000, they go to the store
to buy a plasma TV ...
mobile phones, computers
and an SUV ...
why not even a second home?
The house in America
still increases only.
Greed by the government lowers
September 11 after interest rates to 1%.
So we can all go back to spend.
They all have expensive terms for
trillions of dollars in payments ...
CMO, CDO, SID, ABS ...
75 people in the world know
but what they mean.
I'll tell you what they stand for.
WMD. Mass Destruction Weapons.
While I was tucked away, it seemed
or we become greedy ...
mixed with jealousy.
Investment funds run away with
50 to 100 million U.S. dollars per year.
Mr. banker looks around
and says, "my life is pretty boring '...
so he screwed his interest to
40 to 50, with your money ...
not his own,
but your money.
Because he can.
You would have to borrow. They do not.
And best of all,
nobody is responsible.
Because everyone drinks the same Kool Aid.
Last year, 40% of all
profits from financial services.
Not out of production or something else
do with the needs of the people.
The truth is that we all
part of it ...
banks, consumers, they spend their money
all go around in circles.
We take one U.S. dollar, syringes filled with
steroids and call it profit.
I call it steroids banking.
I am smart when it comes to finance.
- He is fantastic.
Perhaps I have too long in prison, sometimes
it is the only place to stay normal ...
if you look through those bars and says:
"Hey, everyone gone mad?
As clear as it is for those who
clearly pay attention ...
The mother of all evil,
speculation.
'Leverage Debt'.
What it comes down to is borrowing
to the maximum.
What I also find annoying, but it is
a bankrupt business, it does not work ...
it is systematic, malignant
and it's worldwide ...
like cancer.
It is a disease and we
must fight it.
How can this be done?
How we affect the disease,
the benefit of ourselves.
I will tell you.
In three words ...
buy my book.
Prices and profit work.
One moment.
Buy the book but,
you do not get more free advice.
My name is Jacob Moore
I'm going to marry your daughter.
Do they?
- So she did.
I'll give you ten minutes.
I am a prop trader at
Keller Zabel, specializing in energy ...
Too bad Lou, he was the strongest guy
that I have ever known.
However, assuming the rumors begin ...
I wish that I knew who
They had brought the world ...
I loved him very much,
He was like a father to me.
He has provided me a scholarship
at the Fordham Business School.
Nobody else in this branch had the balls
to commit suicide. It is an honorable end.
Mr. Gekko, I'm in love with your daughter ...
it would be an honor for me ...
Why is that funny?
My daughter gave me many years ago
more talk, and you know it.
She gives me the guilt of her brothers
overdose ...
and other disasters
that this world has known since Nintendo.
Do not you think it is strange
that they are dealing with someone from Wall Street?
Why?
- Because they hate it.
Do not you think it is strange that they
has fallen in love with you?
You probably do not have one like this?
No. May I see?
When she was eight.
Can I download a copy of, she does not
photos from her childhood.
I know you disagree and still want
you get anything from me.
What do I get in return?
- Want to trade?
Yes.
You get this, and I get yours
a recent photo of Winnie, without you.
I now not with me.
- Then this is profit.
Energy has always had all my attention.
I specialize in me more and more
solar energy, it's almost a passion.
That is clever
which is the next bubble.
Are you a Greenpeace supporter kind?
No, or you need through the bubble
money as everyone else.
What about the money, Jake?
You like her?
I have never thought of money
as a woman.
She lies in bed at night next to your ...
looking at you,
with one eye open.
Money is a bitch that never sleeps.
Money is a bitch that never sleeps.
She is jealous, and if you do not pay attention,
you'll wake up and she's gone.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko,
terms of money but I do not end up like u.
So that's why you will just have faith?
What do you mean?
Winnie has no money.
Exactly. And here I thought
you a gold digger.
Winnie me know that you look up?
- No.
Not exactly.
I would tell her.
I do not think that's a good idea, mate.
You want to talk to me more often,
but if they do from here ...
then let it not happen again.
You seem a smart guy, just walk away
and pretend you never met me.
I do not understand.
The man you loved as a father,
who threw himself on the subway ...
I think you're angrier than you know
and that you want in the family business.
What would that be then?
- Revenge.
But I'm not in that business,
if one thing I learned in jail ...
that money is not the most important
in your life should be.
Time though, and your time
is now almost over.
Winnie must pass this pain,
you caused.
I caused it?
- She wants you back in her life ...
she can only now yet.
Maybe I can help.
- Maybe you can also ...
maybe not, that makes the market.
I must go.
This is my email address.
Besides, the rumors about Zabel?
- Yes?
It must have been someone
who was believed.
Someone who made a fortune
to shorten shares.
Crushed next.
Rumour has Bretton James
Zabel betrayed to the police.
He has the right knife stabbed in his stomach.
Look at 2000,
the Internet bubble ...
Schwartz at Churchill, they were washed away.
There is enough wealth to obtain ...
hundreds of millions are at
provided that bubble.
I wish I had of one million.
Look at this.
13 banks have been approached in 2000
Schwartz Churchill to save.
James Bretton his division was held
the Internet bubble and jump apart.
Each bank would invest 100 million,
but Zabel said no.
Churchill Schwartz was nearly bankrupt, but was
in time captured by nine banks ...
So they have not only survived,
but we also go through again.
Moral hazard.
- He's a hypocrite.
I do not know Jake, we are
are all on hold.
Wait.
We'll go drinking.
It is not over.
Tell me Doc.
- We need to reduce staff.
We went back to Boston,
pointing us.
And since your company ...
I understand very well, but I
I can keep it going ...
with minimal cuts.
We need to talk with my people.
Agreement. I have to go to a meeting.
Tomorrow afternoon it is on your desk.
What have you found, Robbie?
- There is something definitely happened.
That week there was a large sum
the Cayman Islands.
The Locust Fund.
- Locust Fund, what have you got?
Wednesday a further 500,000 shares, Monday
Tuesday 2 million and a further one million ...
you come in at 3.5 million shares,
who have serious money earned.
Who is that?
Who is the Locust Fund?
I do not and will not want to know.
It may cost me my head.
It will also cost if I head your girlfriend
Tell those high heels.
What girlfriend?
- Find out. I have a hunch.
I hope it's better than your last.
I sense revenge?
You're cold, my friend.
- I'm going to serve hot.
Guinea pull the plug. Overthrow
Ojuwka says that Western bankers are greedy.
We can not lose.
I really know something about energy.
And the Turks would certainly participate in this.
Is it true?
- This is going to happen.
This is really UO nationalize
I promise you.
Are you behind?
- No, Churchill Schwartz.
I can not get behind the façade,
but you and your boys can do that probably.
That they should.
If I nice thing of you this weekend
borrow everything is good between us again.
Deal?
Deal.
We have a deal.
Can he just take over the oil?
- He's crazy. He talks to medicine men.
He will share out of reach.
- No, why should now boarding.
Jake, that company on the coast of Africa.
- Oil. Yes, Hydra Offshore.
And you say that Churchill Schwartz
there part.
This here will be the most expensive
article tomorrow.
'Alice in Wonderland'.
Churchill Schwartz has a big
this position, I want share shortages.
Churchill Schwartz sits behind?
It's just a rumor
it may still get a push.
What is our open position.
Our risk Churchill Schwartz?
Have you heard of the Africa deal?
- Yes, they are nationalized.
Churchill Schwartz, off the floor.
There is no truth, they try
the proportion to kill.
No matter what's going on.
I am convinced
they sit behind Churchill ...
Churchill has a large position
said shares ...
Churchill for the perfect deal
Keller signed with Zabel.
Who knows, who has
a line with an African dictator.
House of pain.
Hydra is to offshore
brought the barn today ...
This is beaten
like a redheaded stepchild ...
and decreased by 19% a
rumor of oil nationalization.
In Equatorial Guinea that
is again a country.
The shock wave hit even
investment banker Churchill Schwartz.
Churchill Schwartz is 8%
down in advance.
Homebuilder confidence fell
to a record low in July.
The monthly indicator of
the National Association of Homebilders ...
You have the high ceiling ...
an additional games room above
not that I want to put you under pressure.
And here ...
This is the sunroom, perfect for reading.
Beautiful light.
And plenty of room for a pool.
Or a tennis court.
What about Rainwater Roadmar?
I leave tomorrow.
I love Sylvia.
- Long Island always rises.
Good schools, good
shopping and many physicians.
Everyone loves it.
You should buy it.
Well, there are many choices on this street.
I think that's so nice to you, baby.
You call a spade by its name.
I would prefer to deposit
now received.
Mom, you have three houses. Of two
soon runs off the mortgage.
You need at least one sell.
- Tell me how I should work, Jacob.
There are no buyers.
The market is what is waiting,
I just need some patience.
It's like the two Florida projects
five years ago ...
I did not panic
and earned 190,000.
Who is Henry Shane?
- Forget it. He is a wimp.
Is that over?
If I had listened to Henry
I would have asked all homes sold.
Like your father would.
No, Dad broke down, he saw his chance
and failed but he saw his chance.
Yes, and then took
Jack Daniels had his opportunity and success.
Can we not argue over
my father every time you come visit?
Well, you're so sensitive,
forget that I have started.
Your father is defending
as defending the smallpox.
The developers are behind me.
I only just need a bridge.
And the money Sagamore Road?
I have invested in new houses.
What did you think that I just
the money would resign?
Do not be so arrogant to
your mother Jacob Lawrence ...
Of course I know the risks.
You buy diamonds.
You've got the bonus right?
I remember that I
visited in the hospital ...
after school and thought, how tough is
my mother who saves lives.
Not change the subject.
I do not.
- I do not save lives.
But you did ot, and that's what counts.
I now earn more per month than
in my best years as a nurse.
You made a difference.
Do you listen to the broker
who preaches 'a difference'.
Ironic.
How much?
200 maximum.
You're killing me.
I will write to you about.
Want to stop that.
You do her no favors.
- I know.
And do not prevent this
it from happening again.
It's all been planned.
Yes?
- Guess.
The assistant phoned James Bretton
like you can come along today.
You're kidding.
Jake, you have one hour.
I told you on the island.
Yes, but I'm in the middle
the Friday afternoon traffic.
He said that was fine because after office hours
He has left his home address.
East 56th and Park Avenue. Eight o'clock tonight.
- Was he upset?
Let him get the fuck, he
this company has destroyed ...
He came in as a rolling
Russell Crowe in Gladiator.
Thanks.
It sounded as if your discharge papers
could pick up.
I have this ring is not necessary.
Take but one of
a cereal box.
What are you talking about, you
mad'll be fine.
I grew up with a
father only talked about money.
If you think I want someone
that his ego in a bank account ...
has listed then you know me.
I love it.
That was what I expected.
Bring him back, it makes me uncomfortable.
- Winnie Well, I bring him back.
Jacob Moore for Mr. James.
- He expects you al
Saturno devorando a un hijo.
That guy has 15 black
paintings, late in his life.
Fourteen have been seen in the Prada.
This is the missing number 15.
An early sketch
Saturn devouring his son.
Are you collecting?
No, only the obsessed
compulsive and insecure egotists ...
have the urge to collect.
Ride your bike?
It's a hobby.
You know the picture right?
1948 Rollie Free.
Established a world record with 150.
He wanted it so badly that he was driving nude.
Why, drive you Mr. Moore?
Let me say this, if you
the rest of your life would ride ..
you know, the best
but you can be ...
you would never drive like I'm driving.
Then I look forward to it
together to drive.
Are you in, Mr. Moore?
What?
Do you like stabbing people?
Your expense Churchill Schwartz
120 million U.S. dollars last week.
It's not very much money ...
but people know that
Hydra Offshore ours.
I had a dinner with the
big boss, Ojuwka in Paris last week.
He has no
plans to nationalize oil fields ...
but I think you
it does not matter.
No, it does not.
I've checked in the office
but you have no money earned.
No, I did.
- Why?
Because you're my company
destroyed it.
Your company has committed suicide.
- You have killed Lewis Zabel.
Zabel Lewis committed suicide.
- You scattered the rumors.
These were true.
- You'll know for care.
No, Mr. Moore as a 50% influence
weighty debt that made it true.
Zabel knew how he had to make money,
die therefore was his choice.
For me it's only money.
But, if you do not know what your doing
is fatal.
Not knowing what you do.
Come work for me.
- What?
We fund the largest
oil companies in the world ...
People who drill, co producers,
gas suppliers ...
I know who you are.
- But we are a bit short ...
in alternative energy.
Why me?
- Because your loyalty demanded revenge ...
did your balls a try, and
your skills were you.
And frankly ...
because I want to beat riding a motorcycle.
In short, you have my attention.
That is quite rare.
If I were you, I would
it serious thought.
Elsewhere you'll have a hard,
Now you have the attention.
I have to go to a charity party.
I need the money bag rattle.
What is your fee?
- Sorry?
You start with 300 like everybody else.
As a partner I would just stop at 600,
and the bonus ...
No, your amount.
The amount you need
to run away and live on.
Everyone has a song that is
often a round number ...
So, what is yours?
More.
How did you know that James was the Bretton?
- Also good morning.
Come inside. Are you hungry?
- No, thanks.
Brett, as I mentioned earlier,
bought and sold earlier for me ...
We picked each other's ideas.
We had a disagreement,
I will not bore you with the details.
It cost me $ 200,000.
That was a lot of money.
When I established himself in the 80 years,
and I realized who my friends were ...
I invited James to not participate.
He did not so much fun.
And?
That is not so important.
If you're in prison, you
much time to think.
The best memory I know,
was hers.
I have spent eight years.
Five before the court.
Nobody gets eight years.
Murderers get five.
I thought it was that link
the airlines that you were betrayed.
Blue Star, Stopwatch?
What was it again?
Bud Fox?
- Bud Fox.
He had a microphone.
I was caught for insider trading.
But that is up 12 to 13 months.
After the first accusation was one of
my co-conspirators who tipped the police.
And the piranha, James Bretton, had just
enough information for me to rat.
You can never know for sure.
- He gave me a job offer.
You're like the center
the universe been fired.
My daughters future looks
truly.
I never earned money
to shorten shares.
Did not you sell?
- That would be insider trading.
Your daughter and I are engaged.
You do not want to tarnish her name?
You might have not sold your
tried to tell the police ...
you have committed no crime.
- What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
You've influenced others to sell
by false information.
It is difficult to prove.
A fisherman always see another angler
from afar.
You need Gordon to me to say.
This I promise you, Gordon.
Now we are equal.
- There she is.
Keep this between us.
How's that website of hers?
- Frozen Truth? Well actually.
50,000 hits per day.
And there are more.
She is so beautiful.
Relationships are like bubbles.
They're fragile.
Like the tulips. This is the
bubbles biggest story ever.
In 1600 the Dutch were
a "speculative fever" ...
They thought that when you have a wonderful
canal house in Amsterdam could buy ...
for the price of a sphere.
They called it the "Tulip Mania".
When it collapsed.
You could buy ten balls for two dollars.
People went bankrupt.
But who knows that?
What would you do with your money?
- I?
Switzerland. That is still the best.
A healthy distrust for big government.
Did you there?
- That I had.
Now I have not much money.
But you still have money.
This is rented.
James has invested in a fund
the Cayman Islands.
Have you ever done anything
the Locust Fund?
Locust Fund. Never heard of it.
But it would be possible.
James wants to be alternative
energy network. Sounds serious.
There's a lot of capital behind
that company. United Fusion.
He polished his resume likely
with some green.
He is in pole position, the boss,
Jules Steinhardt as the pipe off.
This can happen every day.
This company is not only the energy
change, but the world.
Idealism kill any deal.
James is a gambler like me.
He has an ego as big as
Antartica. Like me.
Now you have his attention.
How do you shine when you are in Sun's?
Money and burn it.
Just like old times.
In revenge, we slaughter them off.
This time we return half.
James and I'm going to retrace his Locust Fund.
Do you see how Winnie and me
can get back together.
I can not give any guarantees. Let
We first consider whether they want to go out to dinner with you.
At my age you get everything
what you get.
I had two beautiful children.
I went away and did not see them much.
There, my ex does occur.
And when Rudy died, broke
Winnie all contact.
Apart from the precious and valued
Time owned ...
Winnie is all I have. Do you understand?
- I do my best, Gordon.
Do better your best, then
you both have a father.
He has chosen this place?
- Yes.
Here we met every Sunday evening.
It may be fun.
- I never go to sleep with you.
Then what my friends about it
Marriage really say where.
Go home.
- I do this just for you.
I do this for you.
Mr. Gekko, Jacob Moore.
We phoned each other.
You want a drink?
No.
- And you? A Heineken?
Fine.
Let me guess.
Ginger garlic lobster.
I always ordered it.
I think so.
I've seen that website.
Frozen Truth.
Impressive.
- Thanks.
We have worked hard on.
- There was a nonsense blog ...
the current government accused
of the whole mess we are now in it.
That might be the truth.
- I agree with you.
Is that so?
- Yes.
Rade, congratulations.
Nice to see you.
Great job.
- Thanks.
Nice to see you.
- Thank you very much.
Sorry, I can not.
Why did you let me do this?
This is none of your.
Wait a minute and look
the real man sitting there.
He is sad and wants you
love back into his life.
He is not who you think he is.
- People change. That was long ago.
He will hurt us.
Do not go back inside.
Let's really Babaco about Solar?
It's scam. We have
twice let go in recent years.
The story is about those super things
but the truth is ...
the technology is not the price ...
- We have already discussed.
You're incredible.
- Babaco is a cow.
Who is dead in the water.
The Chinese are not stupid.
Nuclear fusion is apparently over five years
the future.
Laser fusion is the future.
