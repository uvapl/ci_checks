This programme contains some strong
language and scenes of a violent and
sexual nature.

Don't be dirtying that nice clean

You have it lovely, Bosie.
I see myself in it
like Na-a-a-arcissus.
You're at it again. I'm what?
That stuff you do -
big words, poetry.
A-ha.
What are you giving this morning?
A treat -
they may choose any piece they like
from my repertoire.
Come on - it's eight. Carson
will crucify us if we're late.
Hey, Alfie! I've got one request.
Do us that one, "The dead
are dancing with the dead..."
"..And down
the long and silent street
"The dawn,
with silver-sandalled feet,
"Crept like a...!"
Good morning, my dear friends.
ALL: Good morning, Mr Byrne.
"We caught the tread
o' dancin' feet,
"We loitered down
the moonlit street
"And stopped beneath
the harlot's house
"Like wire-pulled automatons.
"Slim, silhouetted skeletons

I love this bit about the ciggy!

My friends,

Permit me, on your behalf,
to welcome her
into our little circle.
Welcome, me dear. Proving once more
that nature imitates art. Miss...?
Rice. Miss Rice.
Miss Rice's entrance matches
perfectly with the lines of a poem.
A little rhyme. Listen.

They're all darkies to me!
The Parlettis are Italian, Lily.
The Fuscos, the Capranis -Look what they do with them! Jesus!
I suppose I have to eat something

BALLAD ON RADIO
Remember this morning,
I said I had a feeling.
One of your premonitions.
I was right.
Someone I was waiting for,
expecting, walked on to the bus,
out of the blue - a girl.
A girl!
That is the power of the nine weeks
of St Jude - a nice girl for you!
It's not for me. It's for me play.
God! Not that again! If you mean
I don't know what it was but
you made a complete banjax of it!
Not that one. I mean another one.
I intend to stage
Oscar Wilde's masterpiece, Salome,
and I've found me princess. Salome.
Is that out of the Bible? Nothing
Art?!
Art has your head put astray.
Mine, as well.
Is she a Dublin girl, this girl?
I don't know.
I haven't really spoken to her yet.
Hm.
GEARS GRIND
Carson! Hm?
'Scuse me, missus.
All tickets, please.
BABY WHIMPERS
This woman has no ticket.
Why, I must have overlooked
this lady. There you are, ma'am.
The bus company is not a charity.
CARSON: If you want to provide
free transport for wasters,
it's up to you.
But if I come on and find a tinker
without a ticket, I'll put you off
the bus, not them. Mark me now!
GIRLS SCREAM
Lovely morning.

The one who danced for Herod and got
the head of John the Baptist? Yeah!
You know it! From the pennyYeah. Philistines!
Say you'll do it, Miss Rice!
Say you'll be...my princess!
Was she a kind of belly-dancer,
Mr Byrne?
Yes!
HORNS TOOT
Well? She's not absolutely agreed,
We begin rehearsals tomorrow.
She'll be perfect.
She is like...
a dog that has strayed.
She's like a narcissus... You're at..trembling in the wind.
She is like a silver flower.
D'you know what I think? What,I think you're soft on her.
Alfred! Something
for the sister - sweetbreads.
It's not offal I seek, Mr Carney.
It's the drama. We're going up!DOOR JINGLES
How did that come about? We found
a new actress. Is that a fact?A new lead.

Great! What do you want, Billy?
Three of them. It's marvellous news.
Great! So, we're going to re-start,
are we?
Oh, now, tell me, tell me, Alfred.
Am I still playing the part
of Algernon?
The thing is...I'll accept no minor part.
No fear, Mr Carney -
you're the backbone,
the very tripes of my production.
You're still my star. God bless you,
Alfred. That's 2s 6d, Billy.
Great. Aaaah. The...refreshments.
Don't worry! I'll provide the ham
for the rehearsal sandwiches.
God bless you.
"It is vulgar to talk about one's
business. Only stockbrokers do that

CHEERING AND WHISTLING
Morning, Mr Byrne. Lovely morning.

Good morning...my dear friends.
Good morning, Mr Byrne.
Good morning, Princess Salome.
BELL RINGS
What's in the sandwiches?
What's in the sandwiches?
Lettuce and rocket.
Rabbit food.
Me ma puts in beef.
So young -
so carnivorous.
You're at it again. At what,That stuff you do. What?
Big words, poetry. I'm going
to find out who this Bosie is.
Better be a bloke. Yeah - a regular
young fella. Know what I mean?
Will you be in my play?
We're going up again.
That's what we say in the theatre -
"going up".
But I have a part for you.
A big part.
You asked me that the last time,
AND the time before. I can't act.
Anyway, acting's stupid.
The lads would rag the arse off me
if I came on acting.
Be in me play.
We...we could dye your hair blond,
like an angel.
You're weird, you are!
Lettuce and plays and poetry
and dying me hair!
Here, come on.
Come on! Carson will crucify us.
Ah.
Mr Byrne.
It's...about the hall, Father.
We'd like it...for a play.
Oh, God, yes!
Your little drama group.
You're trying it again this year?
Will you manage it this time?
We're quietly confident, FatherAnd is it the same one?
No, it's another one.
Er...about John the Baptist.
Oh! His beheading.
Oh, well, it's a biblical theme -
that's a good thing, a fine thing.
I'll get the keys for you.
Isn't there a dance in there?
Would it be immodest? The Archbishop
is very strong on immodest dancing.
Not immodest, Father Kenny -
it's art! Oh.
Art.
I'll get you the keys and...you
might drop off the script some time.
MAN: Well, that's a bold stroke
and no mistake, maestro.
Salome, hmm? What put it into your
head to do something so...exotic
at your time of life?
This will be my testament.
This will be my "coop di grace".
This will be my monument, Baldy.
Then, this girl you're on about -
she's going to be Salome, uh?
Yes.
The Princess Salome.
Her little white hands
fluffing like doves
that fly to their dovecote.
No fool like an old fool.
And...
does Carney know? Ah, yeah.
Have you told him
what play you're doing?
Have you told him it's this one -
Salome?
I told him we're going up again.
I'll give him a script in good time.
He's um...he's in the Sodality
of the Sacred Heart, remember.
He might take it bad - all that
dancing. The Sodality's down on
immodest dancing. It's not immodest.
I mean...
Look,
dancing is neither modest
or immodest.
It's either well done
or badly done.
That's all.
Is that a quote? Almost!
I'll give Carney a starring role -
that will mollify him.
Ah! I see what you're getting at.
He'll be King Harry.
They were both butchers, of course.
LIGHT FIZZLES
Ah, look at this.
This is from the last production.
"Mr Alfred Byrne presents
The Importance Of Being Earnest
by Oscar Wilde.
"Presented on 13 March, 1959."
You see, it was a Friday the 13th.
I remember warning you about that
at the time.
Friday the 13th - it's a known
theatrical tradition, like Hamlet!
What are you talking about, Baldy?They never go up
on a Friday the 13th.
And they never say "Hamlet". Never.
It's Macbeth they never say!
Hm.
Look at these names. Hm?
"Mrs Brady."
Where is she now? Got a new bike.
Er, Rudge.
Forsook the route. Faithless one.
And Miss Greer.
Hm.
Miss Greer, gone to the 14B.
And Joe Gunn, look.
Got a job at the Guinness -
walks to work.
And Greg Whyte.
Ah, yeah, Mr Whyte.
The Reverend Chasuble that was.
The whited sep-luchre!
The abomination!A Morris Minor was it he got?
A Standard Ten, Baldy,
for thirty pieces of silver!
Ah, must have cost more than that.
A metaphor!
A metaphor for betrayal.
I made him from nothing, raised him
up. The first promotion he gets...
..off the bus
and into a new motorcar!
'A Standard Ten!'
'Nrrrrrrrrr!'
"He shall be seated at the throne,
"and the angel of the Lord to spite
him, he shall be eaten up in one -
"him and his Standard Ten!"ALFIE LAUGHS
Fares, please.
WOMAN: The only problem is
I hope they turn up.
HISSING AND BUBBLING
Yeah. Could be a loose connection.
Will you be in me play, Bosie?Me name's Robbie!
And I can't act
and I can't fix this yoke!
It could be the rotor.
The what? You know, the rotor?
It's a diesel, Alfie,
not a bleeding helicopter.
"Rotor"!
I'm gonna be late!
Well...why don't you go
on to the pub?
I'll wait for the breakdown bus.
Yeah? Go on - go!
Na.
I can't leave me bus.
Our bus. No.
A noble sentiment.
We'll amuse ourselves tellingNow that will be fun(!)
"If I can produce
"only one beautiful work of art...
"..I shall be able
"to rob malice of its venom,
"cowardice of its sneer,

An auspicious start to our drama -
the feast of St Blaise,
the protector of throats.
Ah, Daddy was devoted to St Blaise.
Didn't save him from the cigarettes!
So was Mrs Carney, Lily.
So was Mrs Carney.
Ah, lovely occasion though,
wasn't it?
Nice ceremony.
Yeah. One feels cleansed.
Clean as a whistle, Mr Carney.
Not like those poor sinners
over in England.
Are you referring to this scandal,Yeah.
The cut of them girls!
It's a sad case.
Oh, poor creatures - taken like
the women in the Bible in adultery.
There's only one thing worse thanThat's right, Mr Carney.
That's very true. How would that be?
The unspeakable sin!
The sin committed by that poor
benighted creature, Stephen Ward -
homo-opathy.
Ooh! That is really good!
I got it that time!
Remind me again why it's Salome
we're doing, Mr Byrne.
"If I can only produce..." Oh, yeah."..one beautiful work of art..."
"Plucking out the tongue of scorn
by the roots." Wasn't that it?
It's not an excuse to have Miss Rice
buck-lepping around in a set of veils
hired from Gings in Dame Street?
Certainly not, Baldy!
The thought's unworthy of you!
My commitment...is to art.
I certainly hope Miss Rice
will dance, and Robbie will agree
to play the part of Jokaanan.
Oh, dear!
Recite us that piece again.
"If I can only produce..." What?
­
What on earth
were you playing at?
< You spoiled the whole game!
On...on the panel.
Look on the panel.
Stage manager. Oh.
Ah, splendid fellow!
Er...first,
thank you for coming.
Um...
And second, there are some changes.
The major change is, of course,
that we're putting on Wilde's
masterpiece Salome this time, and
not The Importance Of Being Earnest.
Er...
Some things remain the same. Er...
Mr Christy Bald
is still stage manager.
And Mrs Crowe
is our Lord-High-everything-else!
And now...
Now to the cast.
Mr Carney
will be King Herod.
And Mrs Grace will be...
our handsome Herodias.
I'm pleased to say that the
Curran twins have agreed to play
First Soldier and Second Soldier.
Mr Jack...
Phil.
Mr Phil...and Mr Jack.
I-I shall be Jokaanan for NOW.
But...I believe that that part
will be filled presently.
I confidently expect it.
And now...who will be
the page of Herodias?
Um...
Um...Mr Lally!
Er...
Perhaps we'd better make you
a Cappadocian.
I'll...come back to you.
Er...
But the best news of all
is...that we have a new star
in our little firmament,
a Salome as beautiful...
and talented...
as Oscar Wilde himself
would have wished.
Miss...
Adele Rice.
But, as she is new to the part
and to the theatre,
she will observe only
at this rehearsal.
Mr Bald, illuminate the stage
and we will begin.
ALL: Aaagh!
Ah!
Lily!
Lily!
Come down a minute. Would you mind?
What? >
This...This is salacious stuff!
What's salacious? This play, Salome,
Listen to it, "What shall I do now,
Jokaanan? Neither floods nor
great waters can quench my passion.
"I was a princess, thou didCome on, no! That makes me feel weak.
Sit down. It's nothing but smut.
I can't condone it,
let alone take a part in it.
I won't read you any more. A decent
woman shouldn't hear half of this!
Now, I'll get you a nice cordial.
Oh, yes. Raspberry, please. Right.
Raspberry's very soothing.
Are you all right?

Lily, I...didn't realise

what you'd been put through.
Oh, he was very strange
from a child - solitary, you know.
Uh-huh. A reader. Oh. Yes.
You know another thing, that room
of his, he never unlocks that room.
There'd be no locks if it was me.
You need access. Without that, youAnd d'you
know what's in his room? Books.
Hundreds of books under lock and key.
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.
Mind you, he told me they were
all about...railway trains.
Let me get that out of your way.Thank you.
Railway trains - I doubt that! Yeah.
"Bring me the head
of John the Baptist" indeed!
CARSON: All tickets, please.
Well, for once, I can't fault you -
no spongers on board.
The young fella -
getting better at keeping nix.
Oh, there's a pair of youse in it!
And I have my eyes on youse both!
"The Tetrarch has a sombre look."
"Yes, he has a sombre look.
"He is looking at something."
"He is looking at someone..."
Stop doing that! "Yes, stop..."
..Where's that? Would you stop
I'm not! You are! Calmly,
"The Tetrarch has a sombre look..."
Good morning, Mr... Morning! ..Ryan.
You are playing various Nazarenes.
Speaking? No, mute, I'm afraid.
But nonetheless important for that.
Hold tight! ..From where we were.
"The Tetrarch has a sombre look."
"Yes, he has a sombre look..."
Stop doing that!
DOG BARKS
Mrs Crowe,
would you have a get on to Gings,
the costumiers in Dame Street?
I think there's been some mistake.
No. Oh.
No. He's changed the locks again.
He does that to thwart me!
Oh! Lily,
let me look through that keyhole.
My God, look at that! Look at it!
God, he has to be stopped! He'll
contaminate us all with that filth!
I have a key that fits all locks.
I'll have these books destroyed.
It's for his own good, Lily. Yes.
And this play, I'll have that
taken off with all the haste
that Father Kenny can muster.
And as a gesture of sisterly...
Let me get the light. There you are.Lovely.

We must keep him out of harm's way.
But... It's about time. You don't

I don't mean have him committed,
but that's a good idea. No, I...
I was talking about marriage,
Lily, my dear.
Marriage - Alfie? The natural state
Like a priest or a widower,
maybe... You know, by rights.By rights, Mr Carney. Married,
and out of the house by rights.
I wouldn't sayBut I would, Mr Carney. I would.
Now that's lovely. Who's that?
Who is it? I don't know.

'Scuse me. Are you Miss Rice?
Yes.
Well, I'm Alfie's sister.
Mr Byrne?
Yes.
From the bus?
Yeah.
Our director?
Yeah. Can I have a quick word?
Alfie, he's just crippled
with shyness. So he asked me to come
and ask you to tea with us tonight.
He wants me to come to tea?
Course he does -
a beautiful girl like you.
Do you know where we live?
No.
It's James's Street.
A butcher's shop, Carney's,
we live over that.
Right. I brought you
some eggs, love.
There's no proper food in digs.
You need nourishment.
Don't forget - James's Street,
butcher's shop, tonight. See you.
Oh, Lord!
LOUDLY: "You must not look at her.
You look too much at her!"
Mr Lally, would you
mind if we did it just once more?
"How pale the princess is.
"Never...
"have I seen her so pale.
"She...is like the shadow
"of a white rose
in a mirror of silver."
AS BEFORE: "You must not look at her.
You look too much at her."
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
Er...
Mr Lally - a moment.
This is art.
Mr Lally, you understand - art?
And art never expresses anything
but itself.
Well, what does that MEAN, Mr Byrne?
It means quieter, Mr Lally!
Try it once more.
"She is like the shadow
of a white rose...
"..in a mirror of silver."
AS BEFORE: "You look too much at her.
You must not look at her."
Better.
Better. Much better.

He wasn't at the rehearsal again.
Sodality night -
he's the secretary.
Did the rehearsals go well? >
Going splendidly.
What's your first name again, pet?
Adele.
Beautiful name.
- Adele. Do you enjoy rehearsals?
- Grand.
Great. What's this play about
anyway? H-hmm! It needs spice.
Is there a nice
little love-scene in it?
I don't think you'd call it love.
It's...
Spice, Adele?LILY: I think love is great.
< Lovely!
< What part of
the country are you from?
Roscommon.
- Where's that?
- On the Shannon.
Bread?
And eat your omelette.
He's a great cook.

I think any girl who finds man who
can cook is very lucky. He does it
all. I never lift a finger! Lily!

No, no. I mean...

like your sister said. Oh, God. No!
What did she say? It doesn't matter.
She's trying to fix us up! Ooooh!
Listen, Mr Byrne. There's
something I wanted to tell you
but I never got a chance. You see...
You have a boy. You have a fella.
Yes.
You see...you know
very little about me, really.
I think you think more of me
than I deserve.
You seem to me perfect, Adele.
And your young fella?
Are you fond of him?
Ah!
Young love is a lovely thing.
Or so I'm told!
And...is he...is he here?
In Dublin?
No.
No, no, no.
And what's he called - this lucky
man who's loved by a princess?
John.
That's a coincidence. John, huh?
He's a very lucky fella,
that John of yours.
SEALS BARK
It's all right. It's nothing.
I'm just being stupid.
Oh!
People are very harsh judges,

Well, why should anyone judge you,
my princess?
Oh, I'm far from a princess.
Far from it.
But I know you won't judge me
too harsh. Judge you - why?
Oh, come on!
Stop!
What are you like, Mr Byrne?
I'd invite you in for tea but...
Oh, no!
I only have one room and they don't
allow guests. Course. Lodgings.
Oh, thank you for the zoo. ThanksYou're very nice.
Mr Byrne?
I hope you're not cross about John.
No, no!
That's a sort of joy to me -
to know that you love someone
and that they love you in return.
Adele...
"The love that dare not speak its
name." Do you know what that is?
I don't, Mr Byrne...
to be honest.

Where's the page of Herodias?
Ah, there. On stage, Mr Lally.
We're ready for you...Mr Byrne, a minute, please.
Um...
I'd be better off saying my lines
from down here, if you don't mind.
But... May I enquire why?
Oh, it's...
the beating. The beating?
Yeah. Where is it?
Here. There. Now, look there.
"She strikes the page
with her fan."
Well?
Well, there's a bit...
too much gusto in the striking,

I think what we need here...
is a break.

She IS innocent.
She is a virgin.

D'you ever get lonely, Baldy?
Ach, yeah. Course I do,
since Mary passed away, God rest her.
Ah, a man needs a partner -
a helpmate.
That's why God made man and woman.
D'you know...?
D'you know what I miss?
The cuddles. Ah.
That's the best thing about marriage.
I mean, Mary was a great cook,
and a great ironer of a shirt.
Oh, yeah - I know, I know.
But... But...
Best of all...
Your Mary, she was a big woman.
Ah.
Break a bag of ribs she would.
Nothing like it.
That's what you need -
a woman to cuddle you.
Stop your mooning around.
Set you to rights.
ADELE: "I am ready..."
"Tetrarch."
Excellent, Adele!
Good. Good. Oh, ah, Mr Bald...
Hey, hey!
Mr Byrne, come here a minute.
I want to tell you something.
You have got her completely wrong.
All wrong.
She's not
what you think she is at all!
She's a tough cookie.
She's a bad person
through and through.
She's a whore, Mr Byrne. Mr Lally!
And you are playing her...
like a nun.
Oh! You mean Salome?!
And who else?
You don't think I was talking about
Miss Rice, do you? No. Course not.
But... But that's just it.
Now,
this is not real life.
Hm?
I mean,
that's Wilde's great achievement...
to...to take the crude clay
of real life...
and to transmute it...into art.
So, though Salome...
is a belly-dancer,
she's pure -
as quicksilver is pure.
D'you see?
Wilde had no life aside from art -
remember that, Mr Lally.
He lived in the realm
of the aesthetic.
He never descended into the sewer.
Mr Bald!
Well...that's not what
Mr Carney's saying, Mr B-Byrne.
< "And for St Joseph's bursary
for the education...
"of young clerics, the sum of...
"three pounds, ten shillings."
Now, that concludes
the financial report.
< That's it, then.
The financial report is finished.
Ah, yes, good. So it is.
So, then, the minutes. >
We've done the minutes!
Oh, yes, so we did. Good.
So, it's any other business.
That's me.Oh, yes - Mr Carney.
I must draw attention
to the purpose to which
St Imelda's Hall is being put.
Certainly. Well, it's become a house
Merciful hour!
A house of smut -
of foul, sensual language,
excessive drinking, violent
behaviour and immodest dancing.
When did this happen? You shouldI did not!
I'm as strong on drink and immodest
dancing as the Archbishop himself.
That's a strong accusation. So be it.
Oh, sure! That's Alfie Byrne's play!
Oscar Wilde's play - Salome.Yes, and I believe you're in it.
I'm surprised you're not rehearsing!
You wouldn't see me in a play with
these words in it. I'll read them.
These are the words here.
"Incestuous." "Harlot."
"Abominations." "Fornication."
Look. "Fornication"?
"Bladrick." What?
"Bladrick."
"Baldrick!" Oh. Not "Bladrick".
Second Cappadocian.
Quickly, quickly!
We have a scene to play here.
Fourth Nazarene! Fourth Nazarene!
Baldy, where's Carney? He's notWhat's that? He's not coming?
Carney - he's telling people
to stay away, to boycott you.
He's got the Sodality behind him.
They're saying that the play
is immoral and scurrilous
and I don't know what.
They want to put it out of the hall.
And me -
what are they saying about me?
Carney says you're a bad influence.
Queensberry.
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
A ghost.
A spectre.
A premonition.
And did they...?
Did HE try to turn you against me?
Ah, yeah. I told him to feck off
or I'd burst him!
Ah, Baldy.
My best, my truest friend.
That's the spirit, Mr Byrne.
Now, don't let the bastards
grind you down!
Ah! A commendable sentiment,
if a little coarse in the phrasing.
Right, where are we now?
Here, Mr Byrne. Ah...yes.
Oh, yes. You got what you want
and you're not happy, so...
"What shall I do now...?"
"What shall I do now,
"Jokaanan?
"Neither the floods
"nor the great waters
"can quench me passion.
"I-I-I was...
"a princess
"and thou did..."
"..scorn me.
"Thou did scorn me."
Now, now, now, now, now...
take your time, Miss Rice.
"Neither the floods..."
"Neither the floods
"nor the great waters
"can quench me passion.
"I...
"I was a princess
"and thou
"did scorn me."
This is no good... SI-I-I-I-ILENCE!
"I was..."
"I-I...
Oh!
"I was a virgin
"and thou didst take
my...virginity
"from me."
Oh, Lord!
She's what, Mr Carney?
Pregnant, Mrs Taff.
< Who by?
"Who by?"
That's the 64,000 question!
I got this
from the Sodality in Roscommon.That's where she's from!
Country girls is very lax
in their morals.
It's all the loose straw lying about.
I can't see it. What does it say?
Well, I made a few enquiries.
She left Roscommon a month ago,
and found a niche here in that
charade your brother's putting on.
She's not a suitable mate for him
at all! No! Mutton dressed as lamb!
She's a bit young to be mutton!
Our duty is to impart what we know.
We must WARN! This is terrible.
She always looked a bit of a slapper.
Get us another drop of cordial,
will you, please? Oh, right.
Pregnant! >
Jesus, Mary and holy St Joseph!
Give us that.
What are you looking at?
WHISPERED PRAYERS
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
Father...
Yes. ..if a girl,
a young lady...er...
had...got pregnant and...
You know, what would the man...?
What should...?
Is that you, Mr Byrne?
Is it? Yeah.
Dear God!
This is a turn-up for the books
and no mistake!
Mr Byrne, what...?
What do you intend to do about...
about it?
What will you do about the child?
Will you have some sense, Father?!
I'm not the father! What put it
in my head to come here for advice
I can't think!
Oh, poor Mr Byrne.
Well? Miss Rice.
Miss Adele Rice.
She's up on the back landing.
Me Ma's out. She wouldn't let you
up there, but I don't mind.

ALFRED MOANS
Aaaagh.
MAN: Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Bosie. What did he say?
Dozy.
He called you Dozy.
Dozy.
All right, fella. Come on.
MAN: Dozy bleeding queer!
You, git!
Come on.
Foley, did you hit him?
It was the queers robbed him.
There's only one thing for me now -
absolute humility.
Whatever you say. Go on.
Come on.
Lily, I have a query
and you're a very clever woman.
Could you enlighten me?
Could you tell me what a fondue is?
A fondue is a dog. Shih-tzu Fondue -
Chinese dog. Everyone knows that.
Of course! I know that little dog!
Why - has somebody got one?
Mrs Meehan.
Into the shop she walksand saysDon't you give her any free scraps!
Bits of gristle to exercise the
dog's jaws. Scrap ends and scrags.
Gizzards, innards...
God! Isn't that Alfie?
Alfie! Jesus, Mary and St Joseph,
what happened to you? I'm all right.
Do you know this man?He's my brother!
Can you take him home, please?
What happened? Nothing. Look at him!
I did it to myself.Who were the perpetrators?
Well, he won't press charges.
It's the usual thing. They never do.
Come on.
FAINT RUMBLING
WOMAN: Come on. There's a good fella.
Come on.
There's a good dog. Come on. Come on.

Are you all right?
Uh? Uuuuh!
I'm grand, thanks. I'm grand.
Come on.
Missus!
Missus, could you give us a hand?
HER FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
Here.
THEY GROAN WITH STRAIN
Thanks, missus.
Thanks.Are you sure you're all right?
Did you slip?
I jumped.
Oh, sorry!
What a funny little man you are.
I...couldn't touch a thing.
It's your favourite -
sweetbreads.
When I think
of where your hands have been...!
That's the point -
they've never been anywhere!
I've never been close enough
to anybody to...
rub up against them,
let alone lay me hands on them.
The one...person
I like...
Well, love, dammit!
..Is a fella?
Yes, Lily -
it's a fella.
But don't worry,
because the very idea that...
that I...
I might want or love him...
or...
even feel special toward him...
..would be so repulsive to him
that he wouldn't be able
to get far enough away from me.
So eat up.
Me hands are innocent of affection.
Eat your breakfast.
BUS ENGINE CATCHES
"The love that dare not
speak its name," eh?
Ho-o-o-o-o!
Well, it dared to speak its name
last night by the looks of it!
It didn't speak
love's name last night -
that was my crime. You're lucky not
to be in jail, like yon Stephen Ward!
I am in prison.
I've been in prison all me life.
And the one bird that sang to me
from me prison bars
has upped and flown away.
Oscar Wilde, I suppose.
Alfred Byrne, I fear.
Where's Robbie Fay?
Bosie, is it? Well, Bosie's gone.
Me own boy.
See, I explained to your "own boy",
as you call him,
the kind of man you are,
and what you get up to,
and he was off like a shot...
BANG! ..to get away from you!
Now, it's time.
On your way.
Mr Carson!
"The love that dares not speak its
name." Do you know what that is?
I don't know and I don't want to.
Let me tell you.
It's fine. It's beautiful.
It's the noblest form of affection.
You can kiss my arse!
There's nothing unnatural about it.
It's intellectual.
And it exists repeatedly
between an older and a younger man.
And the older man has intellect
and the younger man
has all the joy and the hope...
and the glamour of life before him.
And that it should be so,
the world doesn't understand.
The world mocks at it.
And, sometimes...
..puts one in the pillory for it,
Bosie.
You must resign!
In flagrante delicto. You were
caught! Everyone on the bus knows
it. Corpus in flagrante delicto.
Yes, the unnatural act.
The sin of Sodom.
Ah, you're a Sodality member...
Was. How can you allow yourself
to be directed by this man?
Now, why shouldn't I?
He's a great sinner.
He's a terrible director.
But I'm staying.
Mrs Crowe, how can you stay
in this bed of abominations?
I don't know what Mr Byrne has done,
but I know him for a good man.
I will stay.
Me too. Thanks, Phil. Jack!
I'm blessed in me friends.
Ernie Lally - you at least!
He has it wrong about her. All wrong
about her, Mr Carney. I'm staying.
You're a bunch of... I'm shocked.
I'm surprised. I don't know
what the world's coming to,
but I know what you're coming to,
Alfred Byrne, a bad end. Yeah.
A sad, bad end.
Oh, Mr Carney!
ROARS OF LAUGHTER
What are you looking at?
Mr Byrne.
Miss Rice.
I'm so sorry.
I was telling the truth, wasn't I,
when I said I wasn't
what you thought I was?
I've learned...
a horrible lesson.
About me.
About meself.
I've come to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
You... You don't have to go
on my account.
I have to go, to England.
To England - why?
I need to go, for me and the baby.
Oh.
Oh, the baby. The baby.
He's moving already. The baby. Maybe
he'll be a dancer like his mother.
And your fella, John.
Will he be going with you?
He doesn't love me, Mr Byrne.
But...
..the other day,That isn't always love, you know.
You're really innocent, aren't you?
Man of the world, Miss Rice(!)
Love's funny, Mr Byrne.
I hope it comes to you one day.
Anyway...
Oh!
Your suitcase.
Life goes on -
with or without art!
I'm sorry about the play.
I'm sorry...
I can't be your Princess Salome.
Bye, Mr Byrne.
"And that never
would he see his face
"And breathe love's woe again..."
There you are.
I came to be in the play.
Where's the actors?
Wha...
What have you done to your hair?D'you like it?
Me own boy!
I thought you'd gone and left me.Don't mind that old shite, Carson.
He had me transferred. Me own boy.
None of that now.
I know where you've been.
I don't care what you get up to.
I like you.
You're me pal.
And I know who Bosie was 'n' all!
So, where's this part you've got
for me in this play? No play.
But, a part...
I have a part for you.
Sit down, me own boy. Sit down.
Read this for me.
Right.
Oh! It's that bleeding poetry again!
Read it, me own boy.
HE MUTTERS:
"Like two doomed ships that pass...
"Like two doomed ships
"that pass in storm,
"We had crossed each other's way."
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
"We made no sign, we said no word -
"We had no word to say.
"For we did not meet
in the holy night
"But in the shameful day..."
Shameful? Read on, me own boy.
"The...
BOTH: "..prison wall
was round us both
"Two outcast men we were.
ROBBIE: "The world
had thrust us from its heart
"And God, from out of his care.
"And the iron gin
that waits for sin
"Had caught us in its snare.
"In debtor's yard,
the stars are hard..."
