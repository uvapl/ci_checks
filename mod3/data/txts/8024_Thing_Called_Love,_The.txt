<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to Nashville.</i>
<i>In just a few minutes, we'll be preparing
our 4:45 departure for New York City.</i>
Howdy. How you doing?
Applications and pencils are on the bar.
Don't steal the pencils.
Hurry it up. Doors close at 4:05.
Anyone not inside at 4:05
doesn't audition.
<i>When I call your name,
I want you to come right up on stage.</i>
<i>And if it's your first time here,
I think you should know...</i>
<i>that if you don't pass,
it just means I don't think you're ready.</i>
<i>So go home and keep on writing,
and come on back again.</i>
- You gonna try for writer's night?
- Yeah.
I'm a writer myself.
I had a top 20 hit last year.
Really?
Young writers always hate it
when I tell them that.
Wanna know
what I'm still doing behind a wheel.
<i>I tell them, live for the moment.</i>
But don't ever get a picture of what
it's gonna be like when you finally hit...
'cause you ain't never gonna be
in that picture.
<i>One, two, un, deux, trois.</i>
- This is it.
- This is it?
<i>Remember, no matter what it looks like
on the outside...</i>
<i>- it's what's going on inside that counts.
- Yeah, I guess.</i>
- There you go.
- Thanks.
<i>Hey, what time is it?</i>
- 4:15.
- 4:15.
We have to do something about this.
- You're here with me.
- What?
I had to stop
and change a flat tire for you...
<i>- which is why I'm late.
- Hey, wait a second.</i>
<i>- James, you know the rules. 4:05.
- I know.</i>
I just stopped to fix this girl's flat tire.
<i>- Oh, that was really nice of you.
- Which is why...</i>
<i>You are a regular Good Samaritan,
you are.</i>
<i>Next time, let the cab driver change
his own tire and you get here on time.</i>
<i>You should consider breaking
one of those rules sometimes, Lucy.</i>
<i>- It might be liberating, if nothing else.
- Hey, I don't know him.</i>
<i>That whole tire thing, that was his idea.</i>
<i>Look, I just came here
from the bus station.</i>
<i>In fact, all the way from New York,
and I mean, I didn't even...</i>
<i>Look, I know I'm late,
but I really did suffer to get here.</i>
<i>- What was your name, honey?
- Miranda Presley. No relation.</i>
<i>Well, Miranda Presley, no relation...</i>
there is nothing you can tell anybody
in this room about suffering.
There's another audition next week.
Hey!
<i>You know, I don't appreciate
you including me in your lie back there.</i>
Especially without asking me.
<i>Well, that's a fine point to make.</i>
Thank you.
Okay.
There might be a song in that.
I was gonna ask you out for a beer...
but I've since changed my mind.
<i>What is that, some kind of line?</i>
Yes.
Does it work?
Sometimes. Rarely.
I'll bet.
I might change my mind again.
Maybe you should change your line.
- That'll be $20.
- I'll pay for the whole week.
That won't work.
<i>Well, the strip is shot. The card is good.</i>
You can call it in if you want.
No need for that. You said it was good.
Never did cotton to the idea
of trusting a machine over a person.
<i>You've got an honest face, Miranda.</i>
Have I got a room for you.
<i>Come on in, sweetie.
Sit wherever you want.</i>
- I'll be right with you.
- Thanks.
<i>Applications, pencils are on the bar.</i>
Don't steal the pencils.
<i>Okay, next.</i>
- Linda Lue Linden?
- That's me. Hi.
<i>Is that really your name, honey?</i>
I'm afraid so. Yeah.
<i>Hey, my name is Linda Lue Linden.</i>
<i>And I'm from Briar Hill, Alabama...</i>
<i>and I just wrote this one, and it's called
Heaven Knocked On My Door.</i>
<i>I had a dream last night
and there you were</i>
<i>Standin' at my bed</i>
Can I start over?
<i>I had a dream last night
and there you were</i>
<i>Standin' by my bedside</i>
<i>Devil in angel's clothin'</i>
<i>Talkin' about your crazy ride</i>
<i>I didn't know what to say at first</i>
<i>I couldn't get by those wings</i>
<i>Now here I am in the middle of the night</i>
<i>Talkin' to you about somethin'</i>
- Miranda Presley?
- Yeah.
Hi. My name is Miranda Presley.
<i>I'm from New York City,
and this song is called Big Bar Hair.</i>
<i>You can see it in the shopping malls</i>
<i>Five-foot girls, six feet tall</i>
<i>Four-inch heels, fake fingernails</i>
<i>She's checkin' out all the sales</i>
<i>You could see it from a distance
She's a good ol' girl</i>
<i>She's gettin' ready to take on the world</i>
<i>Gonna torture my hair
Gonna burn it blond</i>
<i>Gonna tease it beyond repair</i>
<i>Gonna camouflage the brains in there</i>
<i>Gettin' my own big bar hair</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm gettin' my own</i>
<i>Big bar hair</i>
All right. Kyle Davidson.
Hello. I'm Kyle Davidson.
I'm from Connecticut.
<i>This...</i>
<i>I'm a little nervous,
but it really doesn't show.</i>
<i>It's called I Can't Understand.</i>
<i>If you could read my mind</i>
<i>You'd know how hard I tried</i>
<i>But losing was not my plan</i>
<i>And I can't understand</i>
<i>With all those tears I cried</i>
<i>I should have realized</i>
<i>That I'd never hold you again</i>
<i>And I can't understand</i>
<i>I can't understand</i>
<i>Why you left my love behind</i>
<i>I can't understand</i>
<i>But I'll love you till the end of time</i>
<i>I search my memory</i>
All right. James Wright.
<i>Oh, I'm so nervous, I can hardly stand.</i>
You ought to be.
<i>I already sold this song and I...</i>
<i>I wrote it for a woman to sing,
but what the hell.</i>
<i>You got a thing or two
to learn about me, baby</i>
<i>'Cause I ain't takin' it no more
and I don't mean maybe</i>
<i>You don't know right from wrong</i>
<i>The love we had is gone</i>
<i>- So blame it on your lyin', cheatin'
- So blame it on your lyin', cheatin'</i>
<i>- Cold, deadbeatin'
- Cold, deadbeatin'</i>
<i>- Two-timin', double dealin'
- Two-timin', double dealin'</i>
<i>- Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart
- Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart</i>
<i>Well, all I wanted
was to be your one and only</i>
<i>But all I ever got from you
was being lonely</i>
<i>Now that is laid to rest
'Cause you have failed the test</i>
<i>Hey, blame it on your lyin', cheatin',
cold, deadbeatin'</i>
<i>All right, man.</i>
Okay. If I call your name...
it means you're playing here
Saturday night.
Be here before 7:00.
<i>Nancy Butterworth, Nick Barrett...</i>
<i>Tom Mortenson, Janet Hogan...</i>
James Wright and Ross Miller.
And thank you all for coming.
<i>Miss Miranda,
come over here a second.</i>
We're just congregating.
Congratulations.
<i>- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Hey, Kyle Davidson.</i>
<i>- Hey, Linda Lue, is that your face I see?
- Well, it ain't nobody's butt.</i>
<i>- Your song was pretty tonight.
- Oh, it was pretty bad.</i>
<i>So, what did you want?</i>
What?
I was just looking at you up close.
<i>- Yeah, there was something...
- But you changed your mind?</i>
Exactly.
<i>Oh, hey, I liked your song.</i>
Thanks.
- I'm Kyle.
- I liked your song.
<i>Hi. Miranda. I liked yours, too.</i>
- Really?
- Yeah.
<i>So when we meet as friends
My heart will break again</i>
<i>If that's how the story ends</i>
<i>Then I can't understand</i>
- Wow.
- Yeah.
<i>Was that exactly Kyle's song,
because I hardly even recognize it.</i>
<i>Yeah, that was... That was it exactly.</i>
You got a great ear.
You got that from hearing me sing it?
<i>Well, I don't know if the term "sing"
really applies.</i>
<i>Man, they build you up
and then they just tear you down.</i>
Like they all got
the same instruction manual.
- Miranda.
- I'm Linda Lue.
<i>- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.</i>
I really thought
your song back there was great.
...l'd be interested to find out.
Do you ladies have any desire
to accompany Mr. Wright and me...
on an excursion into history?
<i>- And where might you be going?
- Little midnight ride, maybe.</i>
'Cause Connecticut Yankee Kyle
wants to write a cowboy song.
<i>- That's right, ma'am.
- Well, you want to go?</i>
Yeah.
<i>All rightie, then. Let's go, little doogies.</i>
- Dogies.
- Doogies.
Dogies. Come on.
<i>Hey, look at this guy.
He's smiling for us.</i>
That's no smile. That's contempt.
I had a third cousin
who used to be a rodeo clown.
<i>Funny thing is,
he broke his neck and he died.</i>
<i>Well, don't worry about me.
I took riding at summer camp.</i>
Yeah.
The dude ranch in what? New England?
<i>Hey, hey, what do you know? Whoa!</i>
<i>Kyle Davidson,
you are a sight to behold!</i>
<i>Ride them, cowboy!</i>
<i>The old gray mare,
she ain't what she used to be many...</i>
<i>- Look at me, look at me.
- What?</i>
<i>- In the eyes.
- Okay, okay.</i>
- How many fingers am I holding up?
- A couple.
<i>- How many fingers?
- Four or five, yeah.</i>
<i>- How many Beatles were there?
- Three, and Ringo.</i>
- You okay? You okay?
- Yes.
<i>Oh, he's just fucking with me.</i>
<i>- I'm just one hell of a country boy.
- Just a minor concussion, that's all.</i>
<i>Linda, please get the truck,
and I gotta secure the horses, here.</i>
<i>- Make sure he doesn't fall asleep.
- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- Gotta keep him awake and conscious.
- Yes, I'm fine.</i>
<i>Kyle, we have some work on this fence
to do for Mr. Wilson tomorrow.</i>
<i>- You all right, honey?
- Oh, honey.</i>
<i>You know, there's this tradition
when you first get to Nashville...</i>
where you have to go
to the tallest mountain...
<i>or the top of a building,
and throw your head back...</i>
<i>and yell as loud as you can,
"Look out, Music City...</i>
"'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving."
- You got that?
- Got that.
- That's real nice. Okay.
- Don't forget it.
I wasn't sure that song was any good
until I heard you sing it tonight.
<i>- Oh, Kyle, it's a beautiful song.
- Great, will you do the demo for me...</i>
because I don't have anybody else.
I don't have any money
and I can't pay you or anything.
<i>- I got the car. Put on your hat.
- Okay. Yeah, sure.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, put your arm around there.</i>
- Put your arm around my head.
- All right.
<i>Now, honey,
I told you before, he's perfectly fine...</i>
<i>- but we just can't release him.
- Look, could we at least go back...</i>
<i>- and just talk to him?
- Honey, can't you try to relax...</i>
and I'll let you know. He's just fine.
<i>So, where you been staying?</i>
- You know that motel near the Bluebird?
- The Drake?
- Yeah.
- Unreal. That's where I'm staying.
What room did you get?
<i>- Room 108.
- Oh, my God, the dreadful disco room.</i>
<i>Yeah, I kind of like it.</i>
<i>Yeah, you should see mine.
It is so great.</i>
<i>It's all done up and everything.
It's just, I mean, it looks super.</i>
You should come over
and see it sometime.
- Maybe.
- You know what?
I'm getting an idea...
<i>that since we're both at the same motel,
why don't we just...</i>
go ahead and share my room
and then we can save some money.
<i>You just met me.
I mean, you don't even know me.</i>
<i>Oh, please.
I'm an excellent judge of character.</i>
<i>I have a touch of the power, you know.
I truly do.</i>
<i>Daddy, look at me. Are you okay?
You'll be fine.</i>
<i>Johnson, Room 10.</i>
<i>Ma'am, excuse me, are you the doctor?
Can I come in there?</i>
<i>- You can't come in.
- Daddy, I'll be right here! I'll wait.</i>
- Just go. Just wait.
- Okay.
<i>The more I hurt</i>
<i>The less I feel</i>
<i>The more I know</i>
<i>The less I rest in this</i>
<i>Lone star</i>
<i>State of mine</i>
<i>- Did you write that yourself?
- Yeah, just now. For you.</i>
<i>You see, to be honest...</i>
I'm not particularly fond
of hospitals myself.
The truth is...
my dad went into an emergency room
and I never saw him again.
<i>- That's him.
- Well, he looks just like Elvis.</i>
He's the other one
who doesn't look like Elvis.
He gave this to me when I was 10.
<i>My "decitennial accolade," he called it.</i>
He had a name for everything.
He raised me since I was 5.
Just me and him.
<i>So, where was your mom
through all this?</i>
She split...
pretty early on.
Presley's my middle name.
<i>He had this thing, my dad, about Elvis.</i>
Nothing weird.
He always wanted to take me
to Graceland...
but we never made it.
Come on.
There's something I want to do.
<i>Where we going, baby?</i>
<i>Now, don't do it just 'cause Kyle,
that pseudo-hick Kyle, told you to.</i>
<i>Hey, it's a grand old Nashville tradition.</i>
<i>Well, you can bet
he tells that to all the girls...</i>
who get off the Greyhound bus.
<i>Yeah, well,
traditions have to start somewhere.</i>
<i>Look out, Music City...</i>
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!
This is terrible. I cannot watch this.
<i>Look out, Music City...</i>
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!
It's just so desperate.
<i>Well, is this all beneath you,
Mr. Cool Guy?</i>
It's not that I can't do it.
<i>- In fact, I could do it better than most.
- Oh, well, then.</i>
<i>Look out, Music City...</i>
'cause here I am
and I ain't never leaving. There.
<i>Look out, Music City...</i>
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!
<i>Look out, Music City, 'cause here I am
and I ain't never leaving!</i>
<i>Look out, Music City...</i>
'cause I'm here now
and I ain't never leaving!
<i>Look out, Music City...</i>
'cause here I am
and I ain't never leaving!
<i>- Nice view, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.</i>
- I like it up here.
- Yeah. Yeah.
<i>Hey, that's not nice.</i>
I'm sorry. He's usually not like that.
<i>Okay, he's a little jealous. Come on in.</i>
<i>Well, excuse me. This is it.</i>
<i>This is my casa.</i>
<i>If you need anything,
you just help yourself.</i>
Take either bed.
<i>I've been using this one right here,
but that one's good.</i>
<i>All right. Hey, Buster.</i>
<i>- Oh, his name ain't Buster.
- What's his name?</i>
It's Mr. Dog.
<i>Well, how do you know
his first name isn't Buster?</i>
<i>Well, because he would have told me...</i>
<i>because we discuss
practically everything, don't we?</i>
I think that's for me.
Hello?
<i>Hey, Ma.</i>
<i>No, I just got in this second.</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.
Everything's great.</i>
<i>Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I passed my audition.</i>
<i>Yeah, well...</i>
<i>I was waiting for you
to take a breath, Mama...</i>
so I could get a word in edgewise.
<i>Yeah, they said, just like Loretta Lynn.</i>
Where are you going?
I'm just going to the coffee shop
across the street.
Don't wait up.
<i>I sent you two money orders.</i>
<i>Linda Lue, are you listening to me?
Who are you talking to?</i>
<i>No, I'm listening, Mama.</i>
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>
<i>You know,
this stuff is keeping you awake.</i>
<i>- That's the general idea.
- Well, what you need is sleep, honey.</i>
Hey. I was just wondering
if I gave you the spare room key.
<i>Yeah, you did.</i>
Your pajamas have feet?
<i>Oh, yeah,
I unpacked some of your stuff for you.</i>
I put your T-shirts
in the second drawer...
<i>your underthings,
I put those in the top drawer...</i>
and pretty much everything else
I put in the closet...
<i>left to right, light to dark.</i>
<i>- You have a lot of black.
- Okay, great.</i>
<i>See, I can't even wear black.
It just completely washes me out.</i>
<i>- You ain't mad at me, are you?
- No. No. I just...</i>
<i>I came here to be alone,
so I could get some work done.</i>
<i>So it's nothing personal. I just...</i>
<i>Oh, oh. Well, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You know,
sometimes people aren't exactly...</i>
the person you might think they are
when you first meet someone.
<i>Well, if it ain't
little miss "getting my own big bar hair."</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm working on that line.
Is Lucy around?</i>
You must be here
to see about the waitress job.
<i>Oh, no. I'm not a waitress. I'm a writer.</i>
<i>Well, it's getting where
I can't tell the difference anymore.</i>
<i>- Hey, Lucy, come on out here.
- Okay. Just a minute, I'm coming.</i>
- You can call me Floyd.
- Hi. Miranda.
I kind of help run this place.
<i>Well, Miranda Presley "no relation."
What can I do for you, hon?</i>
She's here to see about Darcy's job.
<i>You know,
Darcy quit when she got a job...</i>
with Rodney Crowell singing backup.
She met him right here in this club.
<i>Yeah, slipped him a tape,
which is against the rules.</i>
<i>Well, I am here to see you, Lucy,
if you have a minute.</i>
Sure.
<i>Floyd, I'm gonna need that fryer working
by tonight, now.</i>
- Have I ever let you down?
- Repeatedly.
I wanted to ask you about my audition.
You want to know what I thought
was wrong with your song?
<i>Or what you liked about it.
That would be okay, too, right now.</i>
<i>Well,
I thought your melody was real nice.</i>
<i>You're a good performer, hon.
You looked right at home on stage.</i>
But?
<i>Well, your song is a novelty song...</i>
and maybe you need
to dig in a little deeper.
Let me show you something.
You know what's in here?
These are all really great songs
that were sung here first.
<i>They're not all hits,
but they're really special songs.</i>
<i>Some of them took 10 minutes,
some of them took 10 years.</i>
But every one of these writers
found a way to say something...
that meant something to them.
<i>You know, country music tries its best
to be honest with itself...</i>
<i>and when it's sad, it says it's sad.</i>
<i>Okay. Thanks, Lucy.</i>
<i>Listen, Miranda, I know you're not
interested in this waitress job...</i>
<i>but if you change your mind,
the hours are 4:00 to closing.</i>
And no passing tapes to the customers.
Excuse me.
Did I thank you for bringing glamour
and excitement into my dreary life?
<i>I need a light, not a draft. Look at this.</i>
This guy wants me to strip
at his office party.
<i>Don't do it, darling.
This label's going bankrupt.</i>
<i>Well, that's a good reason for it.</i>
<i>This song is called
Lone Star State of Mine.</i>
<i>Hey, hon.</i>
<i>The more I hurt</i>
<i>The less I feel</i>
<i>The more I know</i>
<i>The less I rest in this</i>
<i>Lone star state of mine</i>
<i>The more I hurt</i>
<i>The less I feel</i>
<i>The more I know</i>
<i>The less I rest in this</i>
<i>Lone star state of mine</i>
<i>Say it straight, don't bend my ear</i>
<i>When I'm walking lost
in an evening air</i>
<i>You two-step into my</i>
<i>I need a Bud, too.</i>
<i>Idle home</i>
<i>And tearing my song all up
with minor chords now</i>
<i>The more I solve, the less I work</i>
<i>That can't be good
for some boy out of love</i>
<i>Out of touch, out of lust,
out of soul, n'out of song</i>
<i>The more I hurt</i>
<i>The less I feel</i>
<i>Should I say more or less to get real?</i>
<i>The more I hurt</i>
<i>The less I dream on</i>
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You play a mean cello.
- Thanks.
<i>It's just a big mandolin, really.</i>
How do you like Nashville so far?
I'm writing a song
about a waitress who kills herself.
<i>- Yeah, it's tough.
- Yeah.</i>
But that's why when I first came here
I went to the roof...
and I told the whole damn town
that I don't plan to leave.
- You really did that?
- Yeah.
<i>- I did, too.
- Yeah, I know. I heard you.</i>
The whole hospital heard you.
<i>In fact,
that's my favorite thing about you so far.</i>
Yeah?
<i>Well, I'm gonna...</i>
<i>You know, James,
trust is like an ice cube.</i>
<i>Once it melts, it's gone.</i>
<i>So, in that regard,
I've heard some things.</i>
<i>Oh, you're speaking
of the R.C. Roberts thing.</i>
<i>Well, we had our troubles.
He wanted me to sound like...</i>
- all that top 20 crossover shit.
- I heard you knocked him out.
<i>Yes, I knocked him...
No, I didn't knock him out.</i>
<i>I hit him. I clocked him good, you know.</i>
Did you sign a contract
with R.C. Roberts?
- No.
- Tell me the truth.
No.
<i>You know, I would have passed on Elvis
if he hit somebody.</i>
You know why? 'Cause I can.
<i>- Yeah. Well, that's good.
- Now, it's not that I'm disinterested.</i>
Understood?
<i>- You're James, right?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>Well, this A and R guy had to leave
while you were still on...</i>
but he wants you to call him
first thing tomorrow.
<i>Well, thank you, dear.
Listen, you've heard my music...</i>
you know what it's all about.
If you have any interest at all...
- please feel free to call.
- Why would I not be...
You got my number.
You can get it from Lucy.
<i>Well, now, I am interested, yes.</i>
Very interested.
I'll call you first thing tomorrow.
<i>First thing. Got it?
Doug Siskin, first thing.</i>
Thank you. Thank you so much.
We work well together.
<i>- Forget about it, baby.
- I'm not gonna forget about it.</i>
<i>- In fact, I owe you.
- Well, if you really mean that...</i>
- I know what I want.
- What's that?
- How about we write a song together?
- Okay.
<i>Well, let's go to the movies, then.</i>
- The movies?
- Yeah.
<i>- I don't wanna go to the movies.
- Come on, baby.</i>
I told you
I want to write a song together.
<i>So, what's this movie about?</i>
It's the oldest story in the book.
Two guys and a girl.
John Wayne and James Stewart
and Vera Miles.
What happens?
<i>Well, let's see.</i>
<i>OI' John and Jimmy</i>
<i>They both loved Miss Vera</i>
<i>Now, you know, in time
Something's bound to go wrong</i>
<i>They love the same girl</i>
<i>She's undecided</i>
<i>Looks like Johnny and Jimmy will fight</i>
<i>Before long</i>
<i>The world goes around
and we're on it, regardless</i>
<i>Sometimes it's warm</i>
<i>Sometimes cold and heartless</i>
Yes.
<i>We all have something</i>
<i>That we're in search of</i>
<i>Dream comin' true</i>
<i>Life full of love</i>
- That's damn good.
- No.
<i>No, it's good.</i>
<i>All right, it's good.</i>
That door sometimes sticks.
<i>Here, let me help you with that.</i>
I should call you sometime.
<i>Yeah, you should.</i>
<i>Good night, moody.</i>
<i>- Lue, wake up.
- I'm awake.</i>
<i>- There's a man outside the room.
- Oh, it's probably Billy.</i>
- Who's Billy?
- We had a date.
<i>He's not real bright,
but he plays real good guitar.</i>
<i>Yup, that's Billy.</i>
Doesn't Billy have a home?
<i>Yeah. Well, it's just,
when he dropped me off tonight...</i>
I told him I wasn't gonna sleep with him.
<i>Because basically,
I've decided that the road to love...</i>
<i>is just a one-way street,
and sex ain't nothing but a road block.</i>
So he says that he'll just sleep out there
to be near me...
<i>and I said, "Go ahead,
sleep out there on the cold cement...</i>
<i>"catch a cold, I don't care."
And he ended up doing that anyway.</i>
Isn't that nice?
<i>Oh, speaking of nice,
look what else he gave me.</i>
- What's that?
- This.
Miss Nashville pageant.
There's prizes and scholarships
and the finalist gets to go...
to the Miss Tennessee pageant
in Jackson.
What do you think?
I think I don't want to be Miss Nashville.
Of course
you don't want to be Miss Nashville.
You already know
what you want to do with your life.
You're lucky.
So what did you end up doing tonight?
I went out with James.
Really? How'd that turn out?
<i>- It was interesting.
- Interesting, huh?</i>
<i>So, you gonna end up
staying up all night...</i>
in that stupid diner writing songs?
Miranda?
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm working on a song about insomnia.
What's your excuse?
- Breakfast?
- Dessert.
I've managed to get studio time
tomorrow at 2:30.
- A.m.?
- Yeah.
- Great.
- Good.
<i>- Good, I'll pick you up.
- All right.</i>
Why didn't you call?
- When?
- Now.
About singing on the demo.
I wanted to see you again.
Okay.
- Good night.
- Good morning.
I'm gonna go write
some more of those good songs.
<i>Yeah, write a good one for me.</i>
I write them about you.
You're gonna need
more marshmallows.
Lue?
Linda Lue?
<i>Oh, Mr. Buster Dog...</i>
the only unfriendly creature
in all of Nashville.
<i>Miss Linda Lue, if you had to change
one thing about the United States...</i>
what would that be?
<i>Well, Bob, I just think America is
the most wonderful place in the world.</i>
<i>- You look great.
- Yeah, well, you know.</i>
<i>I figure if I win Miss Nashville,
I can finally express my natural talent.</i>
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>
<i>Oh, your boyfriend looks
a little overcooked here.</i>
<i>Oh, God, he's getting scorched.</i>
Honey.
<i>- Should we turn him over?
- Yeah, come on.</i>
<i>You know, Miranda,
you may not know this...</i>
<i>since you're asleep
during most of my waking hours, but...</i>
I've been having some serious doubts
about my career as a songwriter.
<i>I mean... Hold him. Lift.</i>
<i>I'll never be as good as you,
and you're not even getting anywhere.</i>
Thanks.
<i>- No, I didn't, you know...
- Yeah, I know.</i>
- You really do look beautiful.
- Really?
<i>Are you sure everything's enough,
like the...</i>
<i>- Oh, oh, it's definitely enough.
- Yeah?</i>
<i>In fact... Yeah, yeah. What did you do?</i>
Follow some beauty queen handbook...
on using all of your makeup
that you own?
- Spit.
- Thank you.
<i>So, has he called yet?</i>
I don't know. Has he called in?
- Spit.
- He will.
<i>I mean, if he doesn't,
he's just a big old doodie-head.</i>
Yeah.
<i>God, your skin is so luminous
underneath all this gunk.</i>
<i>You know, you're my very best friend,
you know that?</i>
<i>That's 'cause you're such a sap, Lue.</i>
Chicken and marshmallows
are completely different.
He's so retarded.
Whoa! I realize it's getting late.
I got an idea pertaining to the ending.
Let's leave out that last chord.
Let's end on the three.
So you're gonna take out
the anticipation?
Take out the anticipation. Exactly.
You wanna leave it hanging
and don't resolve it?
- No resolve.
- Might work. Let's try it.
- Let's give it a shot.
- Let's do it.
- Where do you want to take it from?
- Let's do the last three.
<i>One, two, three.</i>
<i>Like a rolling stone</i>
<i>down a lost highway</i>
<i>Like a rolling stone</i>
<i>down a lost highway</i>
<i>It's right here. Bring it down.</i>
<i>- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, man.</i>
- It works.
- I like it.
Yeah.
<i>- Hey, let's wait outside.
- We'll take it from the...</i>
- Okay.
- From the top.
<i>One, two. One, two, three...</i>
I remember the first time
I learned what sarcasm was.
My brothers and I
were making model airplanes...
and I spilled a little red bottle of paint.
<i>And my brother Sean says,
"Kyle, thank you. Thank you, Kyle."</i>
I couldn't figure out what he meant
for the life of me.
Sarcasm was important in my family.
<i>But, see,
that's what's good about country music.</i>
There's no sarcasm in it.
It's just straightforward.
<i>Makes you laugh or cry, that's it.</i>
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
I realize
I don't really belong in Nashville...
but that's why I try so hard.
<i>Me, too.</i>
I never considered myself
much of a singer.
<i>Well, you are.</i>
<i>I'm much obliged, Steven.</i>
I owe you what? Twenty minutes?
<i>No. Next time, I go first.</i>
- Is that what it is?
- It's that simple.
- Okay.
- Hi.
Hey. Hey.
What's the story with you and James?
I'd be curious to know myself.
<i>Can't understand</i>
<i>why you left my love behind</i>
<i>Can't understand</i>
<i>But I'll love you till the end of time</i>
<i>I search my memory</i>
<i>- For the reason you don't love me
- For the reason you don't love me</i>
You know
who would be great for this song?
- No.
- Trisha Yearwood.
- And I know her.
- Yeah?
<i>Well, yeah.
I delivered a pizza to her house once.</i>
<i>Well, you know,
you should get this to her.</i>
<i>- Yeah, right.
- Kyle, I'm serious.</i>
This song is better
than most of the stuff on the radio.
<i>Well, you always think that...</i>
when you're the only one
who's ever heard it. Trust me.
<i>Oh, all right.</i>
<i>You know, I just got two words for you,
Kyle Davidson.</i>
- Oh yeah? What?
- No wonder.
No wonder?
<i>No wonder, what?</i>
- What?
- What do you think?
<i>Well, what? I don't know.</i>
<i>What, that I still work in a record store?
Or that I'm just another one...</i>
of those guys that never did
what he said he was gonna do?
<i>I know, I just sit around, I play around
and I never get around...</i>
<i>- to putting my stuff out.
- Kyle, you're very talented.</i>
But it doesn't matter if you're afraid of it.
If you're afraid of the disappointment
all the time.
I gotta do something
to get my songs heard.
You're right.
What do you think I should do?
Come with me.
<i>- Well, I guess I will, then, huh?
- I think you should.</i>
- You sure this is Yearwood's house?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Pepperoni and mushrooms. I'm sure.
- Wow.
- Don't scratch it.
- Give me the thing.
- The thing?
- The thing.
- The thing?
- The car thing.
- You don't even know what to call it.
I can't believe this.
I thought you'd done this before.
- You think I'm a criminal?
- I don't know.
I've seen it done.
I had a boyfriend
who's doing time for this.
<i>- Well, time... How much time?
- Eighteen months.</i>
That's a year and a half. Come on...
- I'm joking. That's a joke.
- That was a bad joke.
Give me the tape.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
<i>- We gotta go. Shit, come on!
- Let me put the tape in.</i>
Take it out! It's got my name on it.
How else is she gonna know
whose song it is?
She's also gonna know
that I'm the one that broke into her car.
- That's the one drawback of the plan.
- I can't believe it.
<i>- I'm gonna get the tape.
- Kyle, forget the tape.</i>
- Where's eject?
- Kyle...
Where's eject?
Since when did cops
start responding so fast?
<i>I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do about it.</i>
<i>Look,
we weren't trying to steal anything.</i>
We were just trying to give her a tape.
<i>Well, in that case,
I'll just have to let you go, won't I?</i>
Don't arrest her. It was my tape.
She just broke into the car for me.
- Thanks.
- Believe it or not...
you two don't get to decide
who we arrest.
<i>She's in love with the boy</i>
<i>She's in love with the boy</i>
<i>And even if they have to run away</i>
<i>She gonna marry that boy someday</i>
<i>Right here is your perpetrators there,
Miss Yearwood.</i>
Hi. I'm Kyle Davidson.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is Miranda Presley.
- Hi.
- Hi. Honored.
<i>Well, y'all are really polite
for hardened criminals.</i>
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>
Which one of you
jimmied my car door open?
<i>- She wasn't trying to steal it, though.
- Well, thanks for not scratching it.</i>
- Were you the one singing on the tape?
- Yeah. You listened to the tape?
- Yeah.
- It's his song.
<i>I guess this song is available,
or are you waiting...</i>
to hear from everybody else
whose car you broke into?
<i>No, yours was the only car
we broke into.</i>
<i>Oh, well, I'm flattered.</i>
I just wish I wasn't flattered
this late at night.
Is your phone number on the tape?
<i>Well, I'm gonna have my manager
give you a call...</i>
about putting the song on hold.
<i>Miss Yearwood,
do you want to press charges?</i>
<i>Right now,
all I want to do is get some sleep.</i>
Good night.
<i>- That means no.
- Congratulations, son.</i>
<i>Miss Yearwood, excuse me.
Since you're looking for new material...</i>
<i>Go on, Linda Lue, you can make it.
I don't want to miss the dance.</i>
<i>No, wait. Linda, don't, don't.
Wait a second.</i>
That train's gonna be coming on
around the bend any second...
- so let's just hop the freight.
- Excuse me?
<i>- Come on.
- Kyle...</i>
<i>Come on, it's an old country tradition.</i>
<i>Plus, the tracks go right by
the Full Moon Dance, you guys.</i>
You remember what happened last time
you went on a little adventure?
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Are you kidding me?
You landed in the hospital.
You're the one
who wants to write country songs.
There's nothing more country
than a freight train.
<i>- Kyle.
- Oh, my God.</i>
- Kyle.
- You're gonna break your fool neck!
Go on. Go on.
I'll meet you at the next crossing there.
<i>You know,
I had a cousin who once threw himself...</i>
in front of a speeding train
in the name of love.
Once?
<i>Well, once pretty much did the trick,
Miranda.</i>
I wish you'd stop telling that story.
Why are we letting him
get on that stupid train?
<i>Kyle, come on!</i>
<i>Kyle, listen. I'm serious. Get back here!</i>
<i>- Kyle.
- That ain't funny, Kyle!</i>
<i>Kyle, you're gonna get yourself hurt!</i>
Kyle!
<i>- Kyle, you're gonna hurt yourself!
- Kyle, let's go!</i>
<i>- Kyle, you're stupid.
- He's so stubborn.</i>
<i>You're so stubborn, Kyle!</i>
- Kyle!
- Kyle!
<i>Careful, y'all.</i>
- Kyle! Kyle!
- Where is he?
Over here.
Hi. I slipped.
<i>Are you sure you're okay?
Kyle, you're all right?</i>
You didn't break anything
other than your pride?
<i>- No, I'm okay, I think.
- You sure do enjoy pain, don't you?</i>
<i>- Well, yeah, and heartache.
- Yeah, a little pain and heartache.</i>
<i>- Yeah, well, I'm all right.
- Come on, you big jerk.</i>
Do you think this is funny?
This isn't funny.
<i>People that you know, they get killed
and that's it, you know.</i>
<i>You die and you don't come back.
That's it, you know.</i>
- That's not funny.
- What's the matter with her?
<i>Come on, get up.</i>
<i>- Gave her a little scare, that's all.
- I didn't mean to do that.</i>
<i>Come on, y'all.
Let's show them what we got.</i>
<i>Don't show them what you got, Billy,
you might scare someone.</i>
<i>Well, thanks a lot, Linda Lue.</i>
<i>- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- Yes.</i>
- Really?
- No.
<i>- Good, 'cause I'm sorry.
- You should be.</i>
- I got you.
- Thanks.
<i>Come on, you two.</i>
All right.
<i>Thank you, Katie.</i>
<i>All right, everybody.
I want to introduce you...</i>
<i>to a young friend of mine
from my own home state of Texas.</i>
<i>This is James Wright.</i>
<i>He's a singer-song writer. Very good.</i>
- Did you know he was gonna be here?
- I had no idea. I swear.
<i>- Welcome, Jim.
- Jim. I like that.</i>
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>
<i>Until now</i>
<i>I've been blind</i>
<i>Until now</i>
<i>I've been wastin' time</i>
<i>I've been lost</i>
<i>On streets of plenty</i>
<i>I've been tossed</i>
<i>On icy seas</i>
<i>And all I've crossed</i>
<i>Ain't worth a quarter</i>
<i>It's muddy water</i>
<i>Until now</i>
<i>There's a light</i>
<i>That shines forever</i>
<i>There's a light</i>
<i>That shines for me</i>
<i>There's a light</i>
<i>My footsteps guiding</i>
<i>For I've been hiding</i>
<i>Until now</i>
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>I wrote this next song
for a woman to sing...</i>
<i>so I guess we best get one up here.</i>
<i>I'd like to invite up here on stage
with us, Miss Miranda Presley.</i>
<i>She only heard this song once.</i>
<i>However,
I happen to know she's a quick study.</i>
<i>She'll pick it right up.</i>
<i>- Dale, you got the lyrics on you?
- Right here.</i>
<i>What say? Let's hit it.</i>
<i>One, two. One, two...</i>
<i>You got a thing or two
to learn about me, baby</i>
<i>'Cause I ain't takin' it no more
and I don't mean maybe</i>
<i>You don't know right from wrong</i>
<i>The love we had is gone</i>
<i>- So blame it on your lyin', cheatin'
- Your lyin', cheatin'</i>
<i>cold, deadbeatin'</i>
<i>- two-timin', double dealin'
- And double dealin'</i>
<i>- mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart
- Lovin' heart</i>
<i>Well, all I wanted
was to be your one and only</i>
<i>But all I ever got from you
was being lonely</i>
<i>- Now that is laid to rest
- Now that is laid to rest</i>
<i>- 'Cause you have failed the test
- 'Cause you have failed the test</i>
<i>- Hey, blame it on your lyin', cheatin'
- Hey, blame it on your lyin', cheatin'</i>
<i>- Cold, deadbeatin'
- Cold, deadbeatin'</i>
<i>- Two-timin', double dealin'
- Two-timin', double dealin'</i>
<i>- Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart
- Mean, mistreatin', lovin' heart</i>
<i>Are you headed for a heartache?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah
- Oh, yeah</i>
<i>Gonna get a bad break</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah
- Oh, yeah</i>
<i>- You made a bad mistake
- Oh, yeah</i>
<i>Well, you're never gonna find
another love like mine</i>
<i>- Someone's gonna do you
- Someone's gonna do you</i>
<i>- Like you went and done me, honey
- Like you went and done me, honey</i>
<i>- And when she does you
- And when she does you</i>
<i>- Like she'll do you
- Like she'll do you</i>
<i>- Well, it ain't funny
- Well, it ain't funny</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>The lovely and talented
Miss Miranda Presley.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Well, next up, Jimmie Dale Gilmore.</i>
- Way to go.
- Thank you. Thanks.
<i>- That was beautiful, Miranda.
- Thanks.</i>
<i>- Thanks a lot.
- Beautiful, sweetheart.</i>
<i>Thank you, James. Thank you, Miranda.</i>
<i>- You really did good, James.
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.</i>
- It sounded wonderful.
- James.
<i>- R.C.
- We need to palaver, son.</i>
Fancy meeting you here.
Excuse me a sec. I'll talk later.
<i>Presley, where are you off to?</i>
- Have you seen Kyle around?
- Kyle?
- Yeah.
- I haven't seen Kyle.
I seen him dancing with you earlier.
Fine performance you gave.
You're good on the spot.
<i>James, why didn't you call me?</i>
- Call you?
- Yeah.
- When?
- Ever.
For the same reason
I was so mean to...
Julie what-was-her-name
in second grade.
<i>'Cause I liked her, that's why.</i>
<i>So then, that's why you blew me off
when I saw you last time at the studio?</i>
<i>Well, I seen you there with Kyle
and I was a bit off guard...</i>
- and jealous.
- Could've fooled me.
<i>Oh, 'cause I'm a fool.</i>
Finding it hard breathing...
just looking at you.
<i>Well, open your mouth
and take a breath.</i>
<i>I'm thinking about you,
and I like what I'm thinking.</i>
<i>- I'm glad you like it.
- The truth is, Miranda...</i>
I picked up the phone...
several times...
to call you.
Come here.
Come here.
Just answer me one thing.
Are you gonna go weird on me again?
I want a yes or no answer.
- Yes.
- Yes?
You are gonna go weird on me again?
<i>No. Well, yes, I...</i>
<i>Yes,
I'm not gonna go weird on you again.</i>
Good.
Let's get out of here. Okay?
Where to?
I gotta go take care of something.
You okay?
- Let's meet at the barn.
- At the barn.
<i>Hey, Kyle.</i>
I'm gonna get a ride home with James.
<i>So...</i>
- You asking my permission?
- No.
<i>- It's okay. You can go home with James.
- Oh, thank you.</i>
You expect him to fall in love with you?
I don't know. Do you?
I know him. He's not going to.
Good night.
<i>I can't put my finger on what it is exactly
about you, R. C., that ticks me off.</i>
Charm me all you like...
but I'm not letting you
out of your contract.
<i>- Well, I'll get myself a lawyer.
- Oh, yeah.</i>
I talked to that Doug Siskin.
I told him you'd be free to sign with him
in about two years.
<i>Oh, great.</i>
<i>Now, I've been in this business
longer than you been drawing breath.</i>
<i>I know what I'm doing, James,
and I'm gonna keep you faithful.</i>
<i>- Is that the guy you're with?
- Yeah, that's R.C.</i>
He's a minor league corporate pig.
You told that guy at the Bluebird
you didn't have a contract. You lied.
And you suddenly
produce this business card...
which implies that I'm spoken for.
<i>- So what are you saying?
- Well, you lied for both of us.</i>
All right.
<i>Wow, this is nice.</i>
I like it.
<i>You know, she's got it in her head...</i>
<i>she's gonna go for
the Miss Nashville contest, which...</i>
<i>I mean, I'm sure she'll do really well,
she's so funny.</i>
<i>But, I don't know,
I think it's kind of old-fashioned.</i>
<i>She really cracks me up, though.</i>
She takes those glasses
that are wrapped in plastic...
<i>which are sanitary enough,
and yet she washes them all the time.</i>
I need for you
to stop moving those lips now.
Wait.
I need for you...
to stop playing me now.
"Assured by that same glint
of deathlessness
"Which neither can surprise
In any other pair of eyes"
<i>Oh, I know that poem.</i>
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>
- All right.
- What?
Miss Presley?
Miss Presley.
<i>James,
you're just talking to yourself now.</i>
Miss Presley.
<i>- Is that you, or your ghost I see?
- I don't know.</i>
I was concerned that you left me...
to get me back for not calling you
like I should have.
No. I just don't sleep much.
- Especially at night.
- A night owl.
<i>Sounds like a wise old, tired owl.</i>
You're an owl goddess.
<i>My dad, he was a night owl.</i>
<i>We used to stay up, you know, all night,
just hanging out.</i>
He spoiled me pretty badly.
He really loved country music.
<i>But...</i>
I guess that's why I came here.
I'll spoil you as good as I can.
<i>Elvis?</i>
- You cut Elvis' hair?
- That's right.
<i>- No, I don't believe it.
- Believe it.</i>
<i>You believe that, Lue?</i>
<i>Why on earth would he
make something like that up, Miranda?</i>
- Next.
- I'm just waiting on her. Thanks.
- Why don't you get your hair cut?
- 'Cause I don't want to get my hair cut.
<i>- Come on, Lue.
- I don't want to get my hair cut.</i>
<i>Come on, Lue, it'll be fun.
I'll be Elvis and you could be Priscilla.</i>
<i>I don't wanna be Priscilla, okay?</i>
<i>And I'm not gonna do it
just because you want me to, okay?</i>
I'm getting really tired of doing
what everybody wants me to.
<i>- Good idea. Don't get your hair cut.
- It's got nothing...</i>
Why didn't you ask me what I thought
about you moving out of the motel?
Why doesn't anybody ever ask me
what I think about anything?
Because you're always asking
everyone else what they think.
That's right. You know what?
I'm not gonna do it anymore.
If I don't feel
like being nice to somebody...
<i>well, then I'm gonna
just start being mean...</i>
or at least impolite.
And if I feel like telling somebody
what I think...
<i>well, I'm gonna tell them.</i>
<i>And Billy thinks we're getting married,
just because he wants to.</i>
<i>Well, I'm sorry...</i>
but I gotta be something myself
before I can be somebody's wife.
<i>- Hey, that's right. Tell it, girl.
- Oh, shut up, please.</i>
<i>But, see,
I don't even know what I can be...</i>
because I've never been anything.
<i>And you,
you're not so much better than me.</i>
Your daddy's been dead over a year...
and you still can't sleep
through the night.
And you're so worried about turning out
like everybody else.
But you know what?
I am everybody else.
<i>And turning out like me,
now would that be so terrible?</i>
<i>And who gets their hair cut
by Elvis' barber, anyway?</i>
I'm very sorry.
I guess I'm just falling apart a little bit.
But I want you to know
I think you're very special...
<i>'cause you always liked me,
and that's a plus in my book.</i>
<i>God, did I make you cry?</i>
I like your hair.
- Thanks.
- Maybe I should've gotten mine done.
<i>- Yeah. Well, should we go back?
- I don't think so, Miranda.</i>
<i>You know, I been sitting here
and thinking that...</i>
<i>maybe I'll go to Hollywood,
become a movie star.</i>
<i>- You asking me what I think of the idea?
- No, I'm not.</i>
What about Billy?
Billy can do what he wants.
I'm happy.
I'm so happy.
<i>Me, too.</i>
<i>- Oh, no.
- Oh, don't look.</i>
<i>- Oh, God.
- Don't look.</i>
- I gotta go to work.
- I got a better idea.
- What's that?
- You're sick. I'll call in for you.
<i>"Hello, it's Miranda. I can't come in.</i>
"I'm sick. I've got a terrible head cold."
Okay. I'm sick.
I've got another idea.
Where are we going?
Just give me a hint.
Clue.
Memphis?
Graceland?
We're going to Graceland! Yes.
- See that flock of birds up there?
- Where? There?
It's a sign. Count them.
<i>You know why they're flying together,
don't you?</i>
- Why is that?
- They're friends.
- I think there's 11 of them.
- Eleven.
That's one plus one.
Two is the number of love.
<i>- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.</i>
Closed? No.
- We'll just break it down.
- No.
- Elvis!
- Hello!
- Elvis!
- Hello?
- Sir?
- We're closed.
- And when do you open?
- 9:00 in the morning.
- 9:00 in the morning.
- You all come back then.
<i>- Fourteen hours to kill.
- Oh, what are we gonna do?</i>
- Eat.
- Let's get Elvis food.
Food.
<i>I'm all set, baby.</i>
- You're not gonna eat this all yourself?
- I think maybe he might.
<i>Oh, I see.</i>
What?
- How romantic. Look at that.
- Stop.
- They're gonna think you're for real.
- I am for real.
<i>- Come on, get up.
- Say yes.</i>
<i>Oh, your floral essence is so divine.
Say, "Yes, I can't live without you."</i>
<i>- Go on, honey, say yes.
- Say yes.</i>
I would marry him
if he had any brains at all...
but he doesn't have the sense
he was born with.
I ain't getting off my knees
until you say yes.
I'm gonna kneel right here
until your heart melts.
<i>- Well, say something...
- Say yes, honey.</i>
<i>- Okay, yes.
- There you go.</i>
- All right.
- Is that what you want?
- Are you happy now?
- Happy?
<i>Why, I'm the happiest man alive.</i>
- That's precious.
- Asking her to marry him.
<i>- Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you, kindly.</i>
<i>- You can keep the change.
- Oh, my Lord. Thank you.</i>
Y'all gonna have your honeymoon
in Graceland?
<i>- God bless.
- Come on, dear.</i>
- Goodbye.
- See you later.
You recall the first time I met you
outside the Bluebird?
I was late...
and I made you part of my lie.
<i>Now, you called me on that.</i>
No one has ever done that before
with me...
and I appreciate it. I respect you.
<i>My father...</i>
I don't know why I'm telling you this.
I've never told anyone.
But my father would tell my mother...
that we were going out
for a boys' night out on the town.
And we would go
to his girlfriend's house...
my fifth grade health teacher.
And I'd wait in the truck
listening to the radio stations...
and he was inside
doing whatever it was that he did.
I just remember
all those cheating songs...
how it made perfect sense.
Most everyone back in Wimberley...
says that I'm gonna be
just like my father.
They're wrong.
You hear that?
- Let's dance.
- It's destiny.
Just back for some coffee.
<i>Oh, look, Mary, if it ain't the newlyweds.</i>
<i>Hey, you two lovebirds get married yet?</i>
Couldn't find
an all-night wedding chapel.
<i>Well, we might have if he had
planned this a little better, but...</i>
<i>- No Graceland, no preacher.
- Sure you want to marry this one?</i>
<i>I know she's a handful.
However, I'd die if I lost her.</i>
That's because you'd forget to breathe
if I didn't remind you.
The truth is...
I love her deeply.
<i>Well, if you're serious,
my brother's a preacher...</i>
and I'll go get him if you want.
- Are you serious?
- As a heart attack.
<i>Yeah, man.</i>
<i>Yeah, he's right next door,
probably just watching TV.</i>
<i>- I'll be right back.
- Well...</i>
- Me and Raymond.
- Cold feet?
I forgot something blue in the truck.
Will you come with me?
Please.
I'm gonna get my boom box ready.
<i>Okay. Come on, let's go.</i>
<i>Well, we can't just leave.
We got to at least...</i>
let them know we've changed our mind.
The preacher's on his way.
<i>- It's raining.
- No, no. Look, look, we'll just...</i>
We'll have a fight
and I'll pretend to slap you...
- or shoot you in the leg or something...
- I got a better idea.
What?
Let's get married.
You don't just get married as a joke.
It's not a joke. It's a journey.
Like the old Irish trial marriages.
What old Irish trial marriages?
<i>Well, in ancient Ireland...</i>
there was one day in the year
when you could get married...
- for a year and a day and if you...
- Are you making this up?
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>
<i>Anyhow, you would get married,
and if you wanted to separate...</i>
you'd have to go back to the very same
place you got married and resound...
<i>"I divorce you,
I divorce you, I divorce you."</i>
Like so. What do you think?
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
"By the power vested in me
by the state of Tennessee...
"and by the Almighty God above...
"I now pronounce you man and wife."
Husband and wife.
Husband and wife.
Does that sound right?
Man and woman?
- Man and woman.
- Yeah.
- May I kiss the bride?
- Whatever.
You're married. You may kiss the bride.
- Amen.
- But I get the first dance.
<i>We're home, baby.</i>
I had this dream we got married.
<i>Oh, is that what that was? A dream?</i>
<i>No, me and Elvis.</i>
I had this huge beehive on my head.
Should I be jealous?
<i>Maybe. Maybe, baby.</i>
<i>Yeah, 23rd will be just fine. Bye-bye.</i>
<i>- Hey, Lucy.
- Hey, y'all.</i>
Isn't that Pam Tillis and Kevin Welch
over there?
<i>Yeah, I let them come in
and rehearse every now and then.</i>
<i>You know,
they both got their start right here.</i>
- Really?
- Yup.
Are they gonna be playing
in the round tonight?
<i>No, they got some kind of benefit
or something.</i>
<i>Well, look at you.
You called in sick yesterday...</i>
<i>- and now you look absolutely...
- Married?</i>
James and I got married.
You got married? She got married.
<i>Well,
don't look too excited about it, Lucy.</i>
<i>Well, congratulations.</i>
<i>Hey, Miranda just got married to James.</i>
<i>- Give me a hug, girl.
- To James?</i>
Our James? James Wright?
- Yeah.
- No way.
- Did he give you a ring?
- Sure did.
<i>- Isn't it beautiful?
- Pop open some champagne, Lucy.</i>
<i>How often do people get married,
anyway?</i>
Often enough.
<i>- Hey, look at you.
- Don't I look good?</i>
<i>So, don't keep me in suspense.</i>
<i>- What happened?
- Oh, I was fourth runner-up.</i>
<i>Congratulations, I guess.</i>
She should have won.
Her talent was the best one.
<i>Shoot, people were crying
when she did her scene.</i>
<i>I did a modern interpretation of
Gone with the Wind.</i>
<i>You know,
"Miss Scarlett, Miss Scarlett...</i>
- "I know nothing about birthing..."
- Tell her why you lost.
Okay.
<i>When they made me a finalist,
I was standing there waiting for my turn.</i>
<i>All of a sudden,
I had this image of myself...</i>
<i>at the grand opening of a Piggly Wiggly,
cutting the ribbon...</i>
<i>in a red, white and blue
sequined majorette outfit.</i>
<i>And I had to say to myself,
"Linda Lue Linden, this is not a job.</i>
"This is not a career challenge.
This is bullshit."
<i>All right, girl.</i>
<i>And then, so when they called my name
I just pretended to faint.</i>
<i>Yeah, she did. Fell straight back.</i>
<i>I mean,
they even called me an ambulance.</i>
I gotta pee.
Kyle.
<i>- How's the married life, James?
- Swell.</i>
- It's quite good.
- Good.
I was thinking about it.
<i>Well, congratulations are in order,
so go right ahead.</i>
Congratulations.
<i>Why, thank you.</i>
<i>Yeah, she's a damn good wife.</i>
She's real good.
<i>Why do you have to tell me that, man?</i>
<i>- Well, it's the truth.
- Yeah, but the truth can hurt.</i>
See? You understand?
<i>Hey, you got no right
touching me like that, man.</i>
You got no right
talking about her like that.
- You got no right.
- Keep it to yourself.
Somebody ought to shut you up.
<i>- Hold on!
- Hey, boys, take it outside.</i>
<i>- Why don't I just shut you up, James?
- Take it outside, boys!</i>
<i>- I got no quarrel with you, Kyle!
- Out!</i>
I have no quarrel.
What did you have to go
and do that for?
You're making a fool of yourself!
- A damn fool of yourself!
- How dare you?
Back off!
<i>You best hit me hard,
make that first one count.</i>
Happy to.
<i>- Hey, come on.
- Guys.</i>
Come on.
<i>Miranda, you should leave them alone.
What are you gonna do?</i>
<i>Please stop it. James, Kyle, stop!</i>
<i>You're hurting each other, stop!</i>
<i>James, Kyle, come on.
You don't have to do this.</i>
<i>- Don't, don't, come on!
- No, no. Please!</i>
<i>- Get back. Get back!
- Stop it, come on!</i>
Leave him alone. Kyle. Stop it!
Just trying to keep him
from hurting himself...
<i>- or anyone else.
- Billy, get in there and do something.</i>
<i>Yo, stop it now!</i>
- Like that's a big help.
- Don't do this!
<i>Kyle, come on.</i>
<i>It's over. Kyle, it's over!</i>
Why do y'all got to act so stupid?
<i>There ain't no train out of Nashville</i>
<i>Once you get here
You can't go anywhere</i>
<i>There ain't no train out of Nashville</i>
<i>Ma and Pa, get me out of here</i>
Nothing but damn love songs.
Everybody I love is married
to everybody else.
<i>Here's a brand-new single
from Miss Trisha Yearwood.</i>
That's my song.
<i>Man, I can't believe it.</i>
What's going on?
Didn't you see the stop sign?
<i>- That's my song.
- Well, that's my car.</i>
That's my song playing on the radio.
- You wrote that song?
- Yeah.
You're a better songwriter
than you are a driver.
I seen it.
You wasn't even looking down the road.
That's his song on the radio.
- That's my song!
- That song's all right!
<i>Damn. Kind of makes you wanna
pat your foot, doesn't it?</i>
You should of patted the brake once.
<i>Hey, you got two hits in one day.</i>
<i>Miranda, where's my blue shirt?</i>
- In the hamper.
- I haven't worn it since I washed it.
<i>- I guess somebody else wore it, then.
- Oughtn't you to wash it, then?</i>
I'm not your maid.
<i>Miranda,
you can wear my shirt if you like.</i>
<i>However,
your dirt makes it your laundry.</i>
<i>James, it's not that dirty.
You can wear it if you want.</i>
I can't wear it.
It smells like that soap you use.
I can't stand everything smelling
like that soap you use.
My soap is starting to smell
like your soap.
<i>Well,
then you might as well wear the shirt.</i>
<i>- Oh, you're impossible to live with.
- How would you know, huh?</i>
Lock yourself in a room for three days...
<i>and all you can do is come out and say,
"Where's my blue shirt?"</i>
And when are you ever awake
during daylight hours?
That is not the point.
<i>You have a room where you go inside,
you lock the door...</i>
and I'm not even allowed in.
<i>I mean, how come
you get a room like that, huh?</i>
'Cause you're such a brilliant writer and
I'll never be anywhere as good as you?
- You're just making all this up.
- Why do you get a room?
<i>Well, I've lived here for a while,
and I enjoy the space.</i>
<i>I pay the rent,
although that's not the point.</i>
I was not planning
on having you support me...
- if that's what you thought.
- No.
<i>Rent's not due for a week,
but I'll give it to you now...</i>
just so you don't think
I'm trying to scam you.
<i>Maybe I do this all the time, you know.</i>
Marry guys
so I can live in their house for free...
and have them ignore me.
It seems as though
you've made a check out for...
<i>"selfish, arrogant dickhead."</i>
They'll cash it. They know it's you.
They do?
<i>What is a dickhead, exactly?</i>
You.
If I'm a dickhead
and you're married to a dickhead...
what does that make you?
An idiot.
Think we'd be the perfect match.
An idiot and a dickhead.
- You would think.
- Our first fight.
- I'm not gonna wash your shirt.
- I know that.
<i>Makes me think
maybe God's a woman, too</i>
<i>Makes me think
maybe God's a woman, too</i>
I don't know about that last line.
That's the best line in your song.
It's a hell of a line.
- Really?
- Yeah. Absolutely.
<i>Well, you're the expert, right?</i>
<i>Oh, I have that money I owe you.</i>
Now we're even.
<i>Hey, come on, she's letting people in.</i>
<i>- Come on, get on the stick.
- Come on, don't be late.</i>
<i>- Good luck today.
- Thanks, Ned.</i>
Come on.
<i>Let's sing tonight</i>
<i>The whole world's going crazy</i>
<i>Almost as crazy as I feel</i>
<i>There's a cold rain</i>
<i>Isn't it amazing?</i>
<i>That's not supposed to be the deal</i>
<i>There'll be tornadoes in the trailer park</i>
<i>An eclipse will make
the whole world dark</i>
<i>Just when you think she's got no heart</i>
<i>She'll break a sunny day</i>
<i>Mother Nature</i>
Thank you.
<i>Okay, if I call your name, it means
you're gonna play here Saturday night.</i>
And get here before 7:00.
<i>Carol Ann Harris, Jerry Ward...</i>
<i>Russel Crowne, Joanne Daniel...</i>
- Lester Sharpe.
- All right.
<i>Congratulations, everybody.</i>
<i>Well, gotta get to work.</i>
<i>Well, that sounds like a deal.</i>
Sure will. I'll see you tomorrow.
God bless.
<i>- Oh, my baby.
- Hey.</i>
- Darling Miranda.
- What are you doing?
Guess what happened? I talked to R.C.
- Yeah.
- And worked things out.
- I leave for Austin this evening.
- For Austin?
He's giving me
complete creative control...
and I have to give him $1
every time I smack someone.
<i>Well, how long are you gonna be gone?</i>
Don't know. A month or two.
It depends. It's a record.
<i>- It'll take some time, no doubt.
- Wow, a month or two.</i>
What about me?
You can't quit your job just to
hang around and watch me record.
I thought you'd want to stay here
and have a life.
Settle into our house.
- And do what?
- Do what? I don't know.
What does one do anyway?
There's a number of things you can do.
<i>You could write songs, bird watch.</i>
<i>James,
why don't you just be straight with me?</i>
You don't want me to go along with you.
- I'm not saying that.
- And ever since we got married...
you've just been pushing me
further and further away.
<i>- I'm not saying that.
- What exactly are you saying, then?</i>
Were you planning on asking me
to go with you?
I hadn't given it much thought.
<i>- No, obviously not.
- I just got off the phone.</i>
<i>Am I to take care of you, myself,
my music...</i>
Take care of me?
- Your troubles.
- My troubles?
- Is this it?
- What troubles would those be?
<i>What, the fact that I'm your wife...</i>
and you're splitting town
for two months...
and you don't even ask me
to go with you?
Is that the troubles you're speaking of?
<i>Maybe I'm not the marrying type.
If marriage is this, I...</i>
<i>You know, if you're so scared
of turning out like your father...</i>
you better take a good look at yourself
right now.
- Are you drunk?
- Am I what?
Am I drunk?
- Why would you say that?
- How else could this be so ugly?
<i>Why, because your mother had
to get drunk to deal with your father?</i>
<i>You know, you act so intense,
so calm, so cool and collected.</i>
<i>The truth is, you're so fucking scared.</i>
You're as scared as a little boy.
Get away from me.
It doesn't have to get this ugly.
<i>I divorce you, I divorce you...</i>
I divorce you.
<i>Miranda, you call me up
and you tell me that you're divorced...</i>
and then you tell me that you don't
even want to talk about it anymore.
And I still don't wanna talk about it.
<i>Well, when do you think
you might like to talk about it?</i>
<i>Do you love me, Kyle?</i>
- What?
- Are you in love with me?
Straight answer.
You want me to tell you
how I feel about you?
Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Sometimes you hear a song
on the radio...
and it's just the song
you want to hear right then...
and then it's over
and you're just glad you heard it.
And I'm like that song?
No. You're nothing like that song.
<i>You're like,
if there was one song in the world...</i>
that I could hear for the rest of my life...
you're that song.
Kind of like your favorite song.
<i>- You mean...
- Don't do that.</i>
I used to have a favorite song.
<i>- It was Shadow Dancing.
- Don't make a clich.</i>
<i>You asked me, so I told you.</i>
I'm sorry. You're right.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I think I'm just gonna go home
to New York.
Why?
Because nothing in my life
is working here.
Why did you come to Nashville?
<i>You came here to find yourself, right?</i>
<i>Well, guess what? In New York...</i>
you're gonna be looking
for the same person.
<i>Oh, hi, hon.
I didn't think you were working tonight.</i>
<i>No, I'm not.</i>
I'm quitting.
<i>I'm gonna go back to New York,
you know...</i>
so don't try and talk me out of it.
<i>Well, I won't. I'll just say goodbye.
Come here.</i>
<i>But regardless</i>
<i>Of what love is</i>
<i>We are all blessed</i>
<i>Just that love is</i>
<i>You got it, James.
You're cooking, buddy.</i>
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>This is the final call for Bus 18
to New York City.</i>
<i>Bus 18 for New York City.
This is your final boarding call.</i>
Tell him I'll call him later.
<i>This is one hell of a take, James.
One hell of a take.</i>
<i>- What's the matter, buddy?
- Nothing.</i>
<i>No, this is a good take.</i>
- You like it.
- Absolutely.
Miranda.
Miranda.
<i>- She left town.
- Well, yes, she did.</i>
Where to? Do you know?
<i>Thing is, you did the right thing, James.
You came back for her.</i>
<i>Well, thank you, Floyd.
New York? Is that where she went?</i>
<i>- Home?
- I don't know, James.</i>
Kyle.
- It's good to see you.
- What's going on?
Miranda left me.
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>
<i>- She go to New York? I mean, she...
- Did she?</i>
She said she might.
<i>Okay, that's what I want to hear.
The truth.</i>
Shit.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
<i>- I'm sorry about everything.
- No, I was just being...</i>
<i>Look, it reminds me of the old story...</i>
of the Green King and the Red King...
where they battle each other
each year...
for the favor of the Lady in White.
They take turns dying.
What do you mean? I'm dead this year?
<i>- Well, this year we've both...
- Kicked the bucket.</i>
Yeah.
<i>What I'm saying is,
it's the nature of things.</i>
Two guys and a girl.
- See what I mean?
- It's the oldest story in the book.
Except I blew it.
<i>I'm more like myself now</i>
<i>Than I ever was</i>
<i>And I don't regret it, baby</i>
<i>I'm not afraid of wanting you</i>
<i>I know now what I'm made of</i>
<i>Skin and bone, muscle and blood</i>
<i>I know now what road I'm on</i>
<i>I'm a vagabond on the streets of love</i>
<i>- Hey, Lucy.
- Well, look who's here.</i>
<i>- I got a song.
- Yeah? Well, your husband's over there.</i>
He came back for you.
<i>- Well, I came back for myself.
- Good for you.</i>
<i>Listen, you think you could break
one of those rules for once?</i>
<i>- Well, you ready?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>Well, then let's see what we can do.</i>
All right.
<i>I know now what I'm made of</i>
<i>Skin and bone, muscle and blood</i>
<i>I know now what road I'm on</i>
<i>I'm a vagabond on the streets of love</i>
<i>Honey, I'm a vagabond
on the streets of love</i>
<i>Well, we thought that was it,
but it turns out...</i>
that Miranda Presley is the fat lady
for tonight.
Great song. I'm really proud of you.
<i>- Yeah, I'm glad you came back.
- Yeah, me, too.</i>
Good. Good luck.
This is something new.
<i>I have a dream of my own</i>
<i>And it's mine, all mine alone</i>
<i>It's been my friend since I was just a girl</i>
<i>It has a life, it has a heart</i>
<i>It has a soul and it's a part</i>
<i>Of everything
this woman gives the world</i>
<i>And it's a big dream</i>
<i>Big enough to share</i>
<i>Like a rainbow</i>
<i>Hanging in the air</i>
<i>And I thank God for making it come true</i>
<i>Makes me think
maybe God's a woman, too</i>
<i>Makes me think
maybe God's a woman, too</i>
<i>There's a full moon tonight
And I'm bathing in its light</i>
<i>Naked as the day that I was born</i>
<i>There is no shame beneath this sky</i>
<i>I have kissed the past goodbye</i>
<i>And mended up my broken heart so torn</i>
<i>With a sweet sound only I can make</i>
<i>And it gets stronger
With every breath I take</i>
<i>And it's all a part of making me feel new</i>
<i>Makes me think
maybe God's a woman, too</i>
<i>Makes me think
maybe God's a woman, too</i>
- Hi.
- You were wonderful.
<i>Oh, my God. What are you doing back?</i>
<i>Well, I...</i>
<i>- You were so good. You really were.
- Thanks, Billy.</i>
I had a little something
I had to take care of.
<i>Oh, my God, I should say so.</i>
<i>I mean, what a surprise. I just came
here to say goodbye to Kyle...</i>
- and then I walk in and there you were.
- Goodbye to Kyle? What do you mean?
<i>- Where are you going?
- Listen up, everybody.</i>
<i>If I read your name, it means
you're gonna sing here Saturday night.</i>
You have to be here before 7:00.
<i>David Warner,
Kyle Davidson, Julie Fredericks...</i>
Missy Parker and Miranda Presley.
- I'm so proud of you.
- Congratulations.
- I'll meet you out by the car.
- Okay.
<i>- Come on, baby. We'll see you.
- I'll see you out there.</i>
- Did you find Kyle?
- I didn't see Kyle.
<i>I saw Floyd, I didn't see Kyle.</i>
- Hey!
- You showed them.
- Hey.
- That was great. You were so good.
<i>Yep, sometimes it pays
to break the rules.</i>
<i>Well, all right.</i>
<i>- It was so lovely, pure.
- Yes, Floyd, go fix something.</i>
- I was just gonna say that.
- I'll help.
<i>Excuse me,
I didn't mean to interrupt or anything.</i>
<i>- Can I speak with you?
- Yeah, sure. What's up?</i>
I need to have a word with you
in private.
<i>- Oh, okay. All right.
- Please.</i>
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
<i>That was so soulful,
what you did up there.</i>
- So?
- I missed you. Bad.
- What happened with your album?
- It's okay.
I had to come back to retrieve our love.
<i>So, this is convenient for you now?</i>
I was scared
that I might not see you again.
I realized my fault in all this.
Sounds like a song.
A song that we should write together.
- Yeah?
- I'm still your husband.
<i>No, we got divorced,
if you remember correctly.</i>
<i>Well, it doesn't count.
We gotta go back...</i>
to the very same supermarket
in Memphis for it to be proper.
Yeah?
Okay. We got a date.
- We got a date to get divorced?
- Yeah.
Looks like you've made it
into Lucy's Hall of Fame.
<i>Lucy, that's a big deal.</i>
<i>- Thanks, Lucy.
- It's a good start.</i>
<i>- All right, y'all.
- Right.</i>
<i>James, bags.</i>
<i>Yes, Miss Miranda.</i>
<i>Well, looks like you both pulled
a Linda Lue and changed your minds.</i>
<i>Well, I, too, have changed my mind.</i>
I'm no longer going to Hollywood...
but I'm going to New York
to study serious acting.
<i>New York, huh?</i>
<i>Hell, I told her
she ought to study comedy.</i>
<i>Comedy is part of serious acting, Billy.</i>
<i>- Hey, there's Kyle over there.
- Hey, Kyle Davidson!</i>
Don't you get in that car
without saying goodbye to me.
<i>Come on, get over here.</i>
<i>You, quit being such a handful.</i>
- All right.
- Goodbye.
- Good luck in New York.
- Thank you.
- Stay sweet.
- Okay.
Don't even say goodbye to me.
- Okay.
- Just come here.
<i>Hey, Linda Lue, is that your face I see?</i>
<i>You know, there's something
that you never understood about me.</i>
<i>Oh, Jesus.
That ain't very Christian, Linda Lue.</i>
You could have had me for a song.
Hey.
For good luck.
<i>Oh, God.
You want me to wear a Yankees cap?</i>
Damn Yankees.
Other side.
<i>- Watch the damn dog.
- Get over, Billy.</i>
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>
<i>- See you two... Three.
- So long.</i>
<i>Look out, New York City...</i>
'cause here I come
and I ain't never leaving!
<i>Well, let's all take a drive in my truck.
Come on.</i>
"So when we meet as friends
My heart will break again
"If that's how the story ends"
<i>Then I can't understand</i>
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>
<i>- Hey, Jimmy.
- What?</i>
- I got this idea for a song.
- What's that?
<i>Well, there's these two kings, see...</i>
and they're both always fighting
over the same fair-haired maiden.
- Sounds familiar.
- Yeah.
<i>Well, I'll do the music, you do the lyrics,
and Miranda can sing it.</i>
<i>- Sounds good.
- Hey, I got an idea.</i>
- What?
- Why don't I write the lyrics...
- and you two guys can sing the tune.
- You've gotta be kidding.
<i>- You got a problem with that?
- No, no...</i>
- we're all in agreement.
- Absolutely.
<i>Good, I'm glad.</i>
