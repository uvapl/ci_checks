Why not call it the Big Chill?
Or the Nippia one?
I'm just saying how do we know
it's an ice age?
Because of all the ice!
Well , things just
got a little chillier.
Help! Help!
Come on, kids, let's go.
The traffic압 moving.
But, but, but dad. . .
No "but".
You can play extension later.
Okay.
Come on, guys.
Sally, where's Eddie?
He said something about being on a
verge of a evolutionary breakthrough.
Really?
I'm flying!
Some breakthrough.
Look out!
A mammoth is on its way.
Hey, do the world a favour!
Move your issues off the road!
If my trunk was that small ,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal .
Give me a break.
We've been wandering the whole day.
Oh go ahead. Follow the crowd.
Be quiet when you're gone.
Come on.
Hey, hey. I'm up, I'm up!
Hey rising shine, everybody.
Zeke? Mashu?
Birdie? Uncle Fungis?
Where is everybody?
Come on, guys.
We gonna miss the mi . .the mi . .the . . .
...migration.
They left without me.
They do this every year!
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?
All right, I'll just go by myself.
Oh. Sick!
Hey, wait, buddy!
Gotta you next time!
Oh! Jes... Oh..Yak! Oh..
I can't believe it.
Fresh, wild, greens.
Frank, where did you ever...
Go ahead, pick it.
A dandelion.
I thought the frost wiped them all out.
All but one.
Makes me so. . .
Oh! Yak!
This has definitely not been my day.
I mean... You know what I'm saying, buddy?
Oh what a mess.
Hey, you rhinos, you know, you have really
tiny brains, did you know that?
No. It's just a fact.
No offence!
But you barely know what I앐 talking about.
Oh, yamou.
A dandelion.
Must be the last one of the season.
Carlo.
Easy, Frankie.
He ruined our salad.
Oh, my mistake.
That was my mistake. Let me. . .
No, seriously, let me take care of this.
Oh. What is this?
Pine cones!!!
Oh my goodness, theyre my favourite.
Hmm , delicious.
Au.
That's a. . .good eating.
Don't let me have them all .
No, here, you have some.
Tasty, isn't it?
Bon app俸it.
Now?
Now.
Hey!
Just pretend I am not here.
I wanna hit him full speed.
That's okay, Frank.
We'll have some fun with him .
Don't let them impale me, please.
I wanna live!
Get off me!
Come on, you're making a scene.
We앏l just take our freaky yammer and go.
Would you mind?
Hey. Buddy, if압 not them today,
it's just someone else tomorrow.
I like rather not be today. Okay?
Look. Were gonnaa break your neck so you
don't feel anything. How's that?
Wait a minute.
I thought rhinos were vegetarians.
An excelent point.
Shut up!
Who says we gonna eat him
after we kill him?
Yeh, come on, move it.
You know, I don't like
animals they kill for pleasure.
Say that for mammal that cares.
I'm a mammal that cares.
Okay, look. If either of you make it
Okay, look. If either of you make it
across that sink hole in front of you, you get the Sloth.
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.
You're bluffing, huh?
Yeah, that was a bluff.
Get him!
A dandelion?
We았e did it!
What?
You have beautiful eyes.
Get off my face.
Wow, you and me, we make a great team .
I mean. What앇 you say
we just head South together?
Great! Yeah, hey jump up on my back
and relax your whole way.
Wow. Really?
No.
Wait, aren't you going to South?
The changing seasons,
migration instincts?
Any this a ringing a bell?
I guess not, bye.
Okay, then thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.
Hey, you over-grown weasel .
Wait till we get down there.
Ohohou. That whole South thing is away already.
The heat, the crowd. Who needs any?
I mean. Is this great? You and me, two battlers
knocking about in the wild.
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.
You're very strut mammal.
Can you lead the way, Mr. Big Guy?
Manfred.
How about Mandy the moody
mammoth or manny the ma. . .
Stop following me.
Okay, so you got it.
You won't even know I'm here.
I'll just zip the lip when I say. . .
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.
Isn't it nice if he앏l be joining us for breakfast?
It wouldn't be breakfast without him .
Especially since his daddy wiped out hail for pack.
And wears our skin to keep warm .
An eye for an eye. Don't you think?
Let show that human what happens
when he messes with Sabers.
Alert the troops.
We attack at dawn.
And Diego, bring me that baby. Alive.
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.
I'm wiped out.
That's your shelter?
Hey. You're a big guy. You got a lot of
wood. I'm a little guy.
You았e got half a stick.
Yeah, but with my little stick,
and my highly evolved brain. . .
I'll set aflame...fire.
Fascinating.
We'll see if breeze try to blow us
tonight. Now won't we?
Hey, I think I saw spark.
Any chance I can squeeze
in there with you Mandy ? - Old pal?
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?
Friends? Family?
Poisonous reptiles?
My family is bad to me.
They just kind ...a migrate without me.
You should see what they did last year.
You know, I mean. They woke up early and
they finely tied my hands and feet.
. . . barricade the cave door, and covered
their tracks, went to water to I lose their scents..
They made it anyway.
So what about you? You았e family?
Okay, you're tired, I see.
Well, we'll talk more tomorrow in the morning.
Au,    Au       A, A    Au,  Au.
Manfred? Manfred.
Could you move over?
Come on, nobody falls asleep that fast.
Mandy!
There's Diego, fall back!
Where's the baby?
I았e lost it over the falls.
You lost it?
I want that baby, Diego.
I'll get it.
You앇 better. Unless you want to serve
yourself as the replacement.
We'll go up to Half peak. Meet us there.
It'd better be alive.
Can we trust you with that, Diego?
Let's go!
And that you pick this here off my shoulders, look...
If you gonna have an extra mating dance,
at least pick a female
with the same color palette, right?
And I thought, wow, she's gonna go
prey menses, I mean, you know what I'm saying?
If you find a mate in life,
you should be loyal .
In your case, grateful .
Get away from me.
Well , I think mating for life is stupid.
I mean this is funny sit, or to go around. . .
Mandy?
Look at that.
He's okay.
She's gone.
Hey,hey,hey Mandy,
are you forgetting something?
No.
But you just saved him .
Yeah, but I'm still trying
to get rid of the last thing I saved.
You can't leave him here.
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill .
We should return him .
Let's get something straight here. Okay?
There's no "we".
There never was a "we".
In fact, without me,
there wouldn't even be a "you"!
Just up the hill .
Listen very carefully.
I'm not g-o-i-n-g.
Fine. Be a jerk.
I'll take care of him .
Go. Yeah, that's good.
You앏l take care...
You can't even take care of yourself.
This I gotta see.
I'll return you . We don't need
that weeny-meeny mammoth.Do we?
No we don앖.
You're the embarrassment of the nature,
do you know that?
That is cake.
I'm fine. I'm fine!
I'm gonna die.
That pink thing is mine.
No, actually that pink thing belonged us.
Us?
You two are barely a couple.
There is no "us".
I see.
You can have one of your own
so you won't adopt.
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt this snack.
But we gotta go.
The baby, please.
I was returning him to his herd.
Oh, yeah. Nice try, backtooth.
You're calling me a liar?
I didn't say that.
You were thinking it.
I don't like this cat.
He reads minds.
Name is Diego, friend.
Manfred. And I'm not your friend.
Fine, Manfred.
If you're looking for the humans,
you're wasting your time.
They left this morning.
Thanks for the advice. I beat this.
All right, I'll help you bring it to its herd.
But promise me that
you leave me alone after that.
Okay, okay, deal .
What's your problem?
You're my problem .
But I think you're stressed.
That's why you eat so much.
I mean. It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.
I'm not fat. It's all that fur.
It makes me look puffy.
All right,you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.
I don앖 know. Just drop it on the ledge.
Shouldn't we make sure they found
him? Good idea.
No, no, no!
Wait. Wait.
Don't spear me!
Ohhhm. This is a problem .
Now what?
Oh. That's perfect.
I told you they were gone.
Look who it is.
Don't you have some poor
defenseless animals to disembowel?
They couldn't be far.
I mean. They went this way?
O.o.Or this way?
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?
Hey, I앐 a Sloth. I see a tree,
either leaf, that's my tracking.
You didn't miss them by much.
It's still green.
They headed north 2 hours ago.
It압 still green. They headed north 2 hours ago.
You don't need this aggravation.
Give me the baby.
I can track humans a lot
faster than you can.
And you're just a good citizen
helping out, right?
I just know where the human will go.
Glacier-pass.
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.
Well, unless you know how to track,
you았e never gonna reach them
before the pass closes up with snow.
Which should be like, tomorrow.
So you can give that baby to me
or go get lost in the blizzard.
It's your choice.
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We'll return it to the humans.
Oooh. The Big Bad Tiggy Wiggy get left behind.
The Nice, Poor Tiggy Wiggy. . .
Sid, Tiggy Wiggy is gonna lead the way.
Mandy, can I talk to you for a second?
No.
The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky-drawl-face.
And the baby too.
You won앖 always have that jumbo
around to protect you.
And when that day comes,
I suggest you watch your back.
Cause I'll be chewing on it.
Human-tracker,
up front where I can see you.
Help me.
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it anymore!
I았e eaten things they didn't complain this much.
You. Stop shouting.
You're holding it wrong.
Watch its head!
Just put it down.
Its nose압 dry.
That means something is wrong with it.
Someone should lick it.
Just in case.
I'll do it.
Hey, he압 wearing one of those baby things.
So if it poops, where does it go?
Humans are disgusting.
Okay, you.
Check for poop.
Hey. Why am I the poop checker?
Because returning him home was your idea.
Because you're small and insignificant
And because I'll pound you if you don't.
Why else?
Now, Sid!
Yuhh. Yak. Yuhh.
I mean, my goodness.
All right, look out, look out. Coming through.
Watch out!
Stop waving that thing around!
Oh, I'm gonna slip!
It's clean! Got you!
Would you cut it out!
Hey, do that again.
He likes it.
As makes it me feel better too.
Turn him towards me.
Where is the baby?
There it is!
Where is the baby?
There it is!
Stop it! You're scaring him!
I bet he's hungry.
How about some milk?
Uhh. I'd love some.
Not you, the baby.

Burn and die.
Hey, can we have our melon back?
Junior is hungry and. . .
No way! This is our private

Some should feed our forces on the
ground for billions billions years.
So you았e got three melons?
If you weren't smart enough to
plan ahead, then doom on you.
Doom on you! Doom on you!
Get away from me!
Oh! No!

I'm working here, you waste a fur.
Frustrated Diego.
Tracking down helpless
is too difficult for you?
What are you two doing here?
Soto's getting tired of waiting.
Yeah. Yeah. He said,
come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all !
Well, I have a message for Soto.
Tell him , I'm bringing the baby.
And tell him , I'm bringing a mammoth.
A mammoth.
Mammoth never travel alone.
Well, this one does.
And I'm leading him to Half peak.
Look at all that meat.
Let's get him !
Not yet!
We need the whole pack to
bring this mammoth down.
Get everyone ready.
Now!
Where is the baby?
You lost it?
Sid!
It's so ugly.
But it's adorable.
Hello, pumpkin.
Where did you find it?
Ah. The poor kid all alone in the wild.
Sabers were closing in on him.
So I just snatched him.
Oh. So brave.
Yeh. Well , he needed me and
I only wish I have one of my own.
Really?
I never attracted to a male.
Who wouldn't want a family, I always say.
Wher you았e been hiding?
Yeh. Well , you know.
Cute kid, huh?
So, so what I was saying, ladies. . .
Hey!              Hi! Mandy!
What's the matter with you?
Excuse me, ladies.
You just keep marinading
and I'll be right back.
Sssss. Sexy.
He's not much to look at
but it's so hard to find a family guy.
Tell me about it.
But the sensitive ones get eaten.
No,no,no,no, Mandy, moment.
Mandy,  please. I beg you, I need him .
Why? A good looking guy like you?
No. You say that but you don't mean it.
No, seriously, look at you.
Oh. Most ladies, they don't stand the chance.
We have a very cool sense of humour.
We have a very cool sense of humour.
Hey. Don't let me crap your style.
Oh. Thanks, Mandy. You're pal.
You are the best.
Without baby. Mandy, Mandy, I need him .
So, ladies, where were we?
Carlo?
Easy, Frankie.
Pretty tail, huh?
Somebody moves like a cheater.
And that tiger.
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can't he find a sloth?
What am l? A vet-nurse?
What are you looking at bone-bag?
Look at you. You gonna
grow in a great predator, huh?
I don't think so.
What do you got?
You got a little. . .
patch of fur,
no fang, no claws.
Your folds of skin wrapped in tosh.
What압 so threatening about you?
Hey, this is a kind of a ........?
Okay. All right, wise guy.
You got start the time out.
Oh you think that's funny?
How about this?
You'll be snack for the owls.

The tiger beat us to him .
Wait a minute.
He's dead, all right.
No.
Carlo, where's the whole fun?
Oh god. I hate breaking the heart like that.
But you know how it is.
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now there.
Mandy!
Guys, I thought we're in a hurry.
And Diego spit that out,

Boy. For a second there, I actually

I don't eat junk food.

I thought you're gonna. . . Were you?
Come on. Wait up. Wait up! Wait... come

Hey, fellows!
Huh. Thanks for waiting.
3, 2, 1 .
Sure is faithful .
Don't make me reach back there.
That was he. He started it.
I don't care who started it.
I'll finish it.
Modern architecture.
It앏l never last.
Hi, Mandy.
Hi, Diego.
Hey, Sid.
You're lost, aren't you?
No, I know exactly where we are.
Ask him direction.
I don't need directions.
Fine, I'll ask him .
Hey, buddy. Have you seen
any humans go by here?
U u u. I love this game!

Pa.pack of flying fish!
Hey! Great news.
I found a short cut!
What do you mean short cut ?
I mean faster that the
long way around.
Au! I know what a short cut is...
Look, either we slip through there and
and beat the humans at the Glacier Pass.
Or take the long way and miss them.
Through there!
What do you take me for?
This time tomorrow you could be a free mammoth.
Or Mandy, personally I never get tired the Picapu.
Hey guys. Hey guys check this out
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.
No thanks, I choose life.
Then I suggest you take
the short cut!
Are you threatening me?
Move sloth!
Very good Tiger.
Hurry! Inside!
OK, I vote short cut.
Come on guys. Stick together
it's easy to get lost in here.
Eh, guys!
Eh, eh . . . Fish.
Would you keep up please?
I앇 not to keep track one baby.
I got you!
Captain! Iceberg ahead!
Oh no.
Wow! Huh!      Yeah! Who압 up for round
two! Tell the kid to be more careful.
Look, look. Tigers.
No. It's ok. It압 ok.
Look the tigers are just playing tag
with the antilope.
With their teeth.
Come on Sid, lets play tag - youre it.
Sure.
Ok, ok. Where are the sloth?
You know. You never see any
sloth in these things. Have you got noticed?
Oh look Mandy! A mammoth.
Uuh. Somebody paint me.
Hey, hey this fat one.
Looks just like you.
Oh, he압 got a family.
Oh, he압 happy.
Look he is playing with this kid.
See Mandy that's your problem.
That's what mammoths supposed to do.
Sid.
Find the female, have the little baby mammoth . . .
Sid
What ?
Shut up
Well. Would you look at that.
The tiger actually did it.
There압 Half-peak.
Next stop.
Glacier pass
How could I ever doubt of you ?
Did you hear that little fellow?
You are almost home?
I feel too sweaty.
Do you have to get a news flash.
Every time your body does something ?
Don앖 fear. Just ignore him
Seriously, my feet are really hot. . .
Tell me that was your stomach.
I am sure that was just thunder.
From under . . ,
ground?
Come on keep up with me.
I wonder if you're moving.
Wow. I wish I'd jump like that.
Wish createn.
Come on move faster.
Have you noticed the river of lava?
Hold Pinkie!
Mandy!!!
Mandy, Mandy, Mandy are you ok?
Come on, come on  say something.
Anything!
What. What? I can't hear you.
You are standing on my trunk.
Are you OK?
Why did  you do that ?
You could have die trying to save me.
That' what you do in a herd...
We look out for each other.
Well . . .thanks.
I don't now how about you guys, but ...
we're the weirdest herd I았e ever seen.
I can't wait to get my
claws in that mammoth.
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.
First, I앐 gonna slice it time-quarters in the sections. I앐
on to put white meat in one pile and the dark in ano...
Hey. Knock it off. I am starving
Next the shouders but occasionally top. Extreamly juicy.
I told you to knock it off!
Save your energy!
Mammoths don't go down easy.
There is only one way to do it.
First you have to force him into a corner.
Cut off his retreat.
And when you three have it trapped...
I앏l go for the throat.
Guys. We gotta get this kid out of the wind.
How much further ? 3 miles
Look at there in the morning.
What're you doing ?
I'm painting sloth on the map.
Hey. Why don't you make it realistic and draw him liing down.
And make him rounder.
Perfect.
I forgot how to laugh.
I am a genius.
From now one you앏l have to refer to me as...
Sid, Lord of the flame.
Hey, Lord of the flame, your tail압 on fire.
Thank you.
From now one I'm gonna call You Diego.
Lord you았e touched me and you are dead.
I am just kidding you little knuckle-head.
Hey lovebirds.
Look at this.
I don't believe it.
Come here you little ...
Come to uncle Sid.
No no this way, this way.
No. no, no. Go to him. Go to him.
Ok...
Good job.
Keep practising.
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.
Come on. Sleep time.
You know Diego, I았e never had a friend
who'd risk his life for me.
Yeah, Mandy압 . . . is a good guy.
Yeah he is.
Well , good night
All right.
Lets get you whole cleaned up.
I mean what압 your daddy gonna say when
we go back smudgy and stinky like this?
OK. Lets clean that up.
That looks good and little bit...
You clean up nice - little fellow.
I think he start to look like me.
Hey Diego, what do you say?
Maybe we shouldn앖 do this.
Why not?
Because if we save him, he앏l grow up to be a hunter.
And who do you think he앏l hunt?
Maybe because we save him he won앖 hunt us.
Au!
Yeh, maybe he앏l grow fur and a long
skinny neck and call you mamma!
What is your problem ?
Nothing. Lets go it's freezing my tail off.
Hey Diego you've frozen back there.
Get down.
What?
Shhh!
Get down and follow me.
Hey, hey! What's going on?
At the bottom of Half-peak ...there
is an ambush waiting for you.
What?
What do you mean ambush.
You set us up ?
It was my job, I was supposed to
get the baby but then. . .
You brought us home for dinner!!!
That's it you're out of the herd.
I am sorry.
No you are not . Not yet
Listen I can help you.
Stay close Sid.
We can find our way out.
You can't . Pack압 too strong.
You have to trust me!
Trust you ? Why in the world
would we trust you ?
Because I am your only chance.
Hello ladies
Hey look who decided to show up.
Diego. I was beginning to
worry about you.
No need to worry
In about 2 minutes you'll be
satisfying your taste ... for revenge.
Very nice!
I see the sloth!
And he압 got the baby!
Don't give away your positions
until we see the mammoth.
He압 the one we have to surprise.
You wanna maul something. Don't you think?
I wanna maul.
Then what are you waiting for?
No I said wait for the mammoth!
Yohou! Backscratcher. Ahaa!
Eat my powder!
Slalom, slalom baby!
Sorry fellas, it got a little frostbite.
Get him!
Surprise !
Ok follow me.
We앏l take up Sede and get out of
here when we can.
Come on Diego, let's bring
this mammoth down.
There he is.
That압 right - where압 the baby. Oh!
Survival on the finished.
I don앖 think so.      Yeah!
What are you doing ?
Leave the mammoth alone!
Fine! I'll take you down first.
We did it!
We were some team , huh?
Were? Come on. We're still a team.
I am sorry I set you up.
Ah. You know me. I am too lazy to hold a brunch.
Hey. Knock it off. Squab.
You have to be strong.
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.
Especially Sid.
Come on. You can lick this. You're a tiger.
Look I앏l carry you. Come on, what do you say?
Come on Diego,
come on.
Tell me it압 gonna be OK Mandy.
Listen. You have to leave me here.
If those humans get through the pass,
you앏l never catch them.
