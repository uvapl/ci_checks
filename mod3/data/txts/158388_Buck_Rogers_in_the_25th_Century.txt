Gordon, where'd you
learn to shoot like that?
I've been doing that sort of thing
since before you were born, Captain.
I'm not letting you leave,
you know.
Somebody is using
a power leech on us!
The time has come for you
to sail into battle!
Because of me, you're going
to die, Wilma, Rogers too.
You are a dead man, Rogers.
<i>The year is 1987</i>
<i>and NASA launches the last</i>
<i>of America's deep space probes. </i>
<i>In a freak mishap, Ranger 3 and its pilot,</i>
<i>Captain William Buck Rogers,</i>
<i>are blown out of their
trajectory into an orbit</i>
<i>which freezes his
life-support systems... </i>
<i>and returns Buck Rogers to Earth... </i>
<i>500 years later. </i>
Stargate 4 coming up in 30 seconds.
Means we'll be home in 26
minutes. That's correct.
Space travel isn't what
it used to be, is it?
It certainly isn't. It used to take
us days just to get to the moon.
- Now if you blink
at the wrong time, you miss it.
Okay, I punched in our destination and it's
been relayed to the computer at the stargate.
Prepare for stargate entry.
Entering stargate.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
Don't make me open
my mouth just yet, Wilma.
Your system will get used to space warp
travel once you've done it a few times.
In most cases.
Terrific.
I'm picking up several
Directorate starfighters dead ahead.
One of them appears to be in combat.
We're coming up on a dogfight, all right.
Anything on the distress channel?
Scout 3 to Leader. I'm under attack
by pirates. Request assistance.
Help me, please.
You should have kept your butt up
with the rest of us, Three.
Now pull yourself together and take
evasive action while we circle back for you.
By the time they do that,
it might be too late.
Shall we?
After you.
Hang on.
- Nice shot, Colonel.
- Nice flying, Captain.
Three, you're in the clear!
Thank you.
Leader to Scout 3.
Indicate the level of damage sustained.
Scout 3,
how badly are you hurt?
Leader, this is Earth Recon 1.
It appears he sustained a hit
on his starboard side.
I'm all right, sir.
The damage is minimal.
You don't sound all right.
Follow us into the flight hangar, Three.
And keep up this time!
Recon 1, I appreciate your concern,
but I'd appreciate it all the more if
next time you'd refrain from interfering...
in a Directorate training mission.
What?
If you call that interfering, there's
something wrong with your Funk & Wagnalls.
I don't know what you mean by that, but how'd
you like to repeat that in the flight hangar?
I'd love to.
What happened to you out there,
Saroyan? I'm sorry, Major Danton.
I couldn't concentrate.
I just couldn't keep up.
Are you all right?
Of course not. He's white as a sheet.
I'm afraid I don't feel
very well, sir.
You two, over there,
come on! Hurry up.
Take this man
to the Directorate clinic.
And have someone over there call me. More than
half of my men are out sick and I wanna know why.
Maybe it's a reflection
on your training techniques.
You're the one who was showing off with
the fancy flying up there, weren't you?
I was responding to a distress signal.
From someone that you knew
was in my command.
That didn't seem to matter much
to the pirates, did it?
My cadets are my responsibility!
- They're mine too, Major.
- Ah, hello, Wilma.
- Uh, Colonel Deering.
- I was also in Recon 1,
and in my judgment,
your cadet was in grave danger.
I gave the okay to interfere.
I see.
Oh, excuse me.
Major Duke Danton,
Captain Buck Rogers.
- So you're Buck Rogers, huh?
- Since the day I was born.
I beg your pardon, Colonel,
but, uh, he's no captain.
That's not quite true, Duke.
While Buck has formally declined
to join the Defense Directorate,
he does help us out on occasion.
Declined to join?
Now, why would a big, brave hotshot
like yourself do something like that?
- I didn't think I'd like the company.
- In fact, speaking of fancy flying,
I was hoping Buck would agree to head
up one of your combat-technique sessions.
I think our pilots...
would greatly benefit from a lecture
in 20th-century battle strategy.
Wilma, that's ridiculous.
You will introduce your class
to Captain Rogers immediately, Major.
That is an order.
Uh, I'd like to check on that cadet.
What was his name?
Saroyan. Regis Saroyan.
If you'll excuse me.
Oh, Wilma?
Don't forget,
drinks, 1900 hours, my place.
You know something, Buck Rogers?
I'll be there.
She's some kind of woman,
isn't she?
Help. Help me.
I can't concentrate.
I don't know what's wrong.
I can't keep up.
Help, somebody.
Pirates. Please?
Somebody.
His father is Tabor Saroyan,
the governor of Vistula.
I suppose I should
notify him personally.
Just how serious is his condition?
It's his nerves controlling his
voluntary muscles and motor coordination.
They're deteriorating,
just like all the others.
Others?
Yes.
The Computer Council has ordered
that a definitive statement
to the general public
not be made just yet.
But so far here in New Chicago,
25,000 cases have been reported.
When did all this start? Three days
ago, while you and Buck were gone.
And another thing.
This disease, or whatever it is,
has cropped up in other cities on Earth, but
here in New Chicago it's much, much worse.
I can't concentrate. You see,
what the Computer Council...
is trying to keep secret is its
effect on our defense squadrons.
For they've been hardest hit of all.
You think it's happening purposely?
Well, come along with me and we'll meet
the man that might be able to tell us that.
I don't know what's wrong.
How is it possible?
Your question, I presume,
is rhetorical.
And therefore,
a waste of my time.
You're just saying that because
you don't know the answer either.
How you hate to admit knowing
no more than I do. I do not.
Yes, you do.
Huer. I was just about
to contact you.
Colonel Deering, this is Dr. Mallory. Colonel.
- Pleasure.
- And his assistant, Stella Ward.
And, oh, of course, Carl.
I find you also somewhat
less than memorable, Dr. Huer.
Dr. Huer, you asked Carl and me
to accomplish two things,
one-find an antidote.
You've developed one.
Not yet, but we shall.
Because you also asked us
to find the source...
of the biochemical agent
that's poisoning Earth's citizens.
Well, that source
is right there.
A food disc?
Consumed by millions of people daily.
How can a contaminant
get into our food?
All processing and distribution is controlled
and monitored by the Food Directorate.
I can't answer that yet.
But Carl and I have developed
a substance...
that will detect the poison.
At least now we can stop any more
contaminated food discs from being distributed.
What about the hundreds of Directorate
pilots that have already been poisoned?
They seem to have been returned to a modicum
of health, but not to full functioning ability.
- You mean they can't fly?
- I'm afraid not.
But a light in the tunnel, Colonel.
Carl here may creak and squeak
and slip a micro disc every now and then,
but I'm sure he'll come up with an
antidote that will put our pilots...
back in their starfighters
very soon.
In my day, we used the strategy
of a popular sport called football.
Football?
to explain combat strategy.
That's a very amusing term,
Rogers.
Does that mean we actually
have to put a ball on our foot?
In any combat situation,
you wanna split their offensive line
and get to the brains of the operation.
Look, are we talking brain surgery
or are we talking combat?
In football, the quarterback
is the brains of the operation.
If you get him while he's still
carrying the ball, your strategy works.
One way of doing this
is by red dogging.
Red dogging?
When you're up against superior
numbers, you wanna sack the quarterback.
You do this
by red dogging your linebacker.
What this means is...
punching a hole
through their offensive line...
so that your top defensive back...
can go right through
and bring the quarterback down.
I tell you,
we never bargained for a lecture...
on ancient sports.
It's fascinating.
- Uh, Buck?
- Yes?
What do you mean by
"sacking the quarterback?"
Yeah, Rogers.
What do you mean by "sacking"?
Do you really wanna know,
Major Danton?
Yeah, I really wanna know.
Well, let me see. Um...
Could you step right
over here for a second, please?
That's fine. Right there.
That's fine.
Now, when I use the term "sack,"
what I mean is "tackle".
And basically,
a tackle looks something like this.
See, class? That's what I mean
by "sacking the quarterback".
Now...
How was that, huh?
Was that any better?
No.
That's clipping. It's illegal.
Let me show you
how you should have done it.
See the difference?
Yeah, yeah, I think I do.
Good.
But, uh, let me try it again.
What in the world was that?
Sounded like Buck.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, uh, that felt
a little better to me.
How 'bout you?
Well, uh,
some people are just slow learners.
There it is again.
Captain Rogers and Major Danton couldn't
possibly be making all that noise.
Wanna bet?
Let's have a look in there.
Well, I think you've
learned enough for one day.
And I'd just like to thank you all...
Now I've learned enough.
That's all for today.
Cadets, report to the hangar at 0800.
Oh, hi, guys.
Two grown men fighting.
How disgusting.
Oh, no. We were
just giving a demonstration.
That's easy for you to say.
Our temperamental friend here
is about to begin...
a nitrogen breakdown
of all the elements we've isolated so far.
Would you please monitor
his readouts till I get back?
Gladly, sir.
It's about time you took a break.
A plus-three factor would indicate a
possible antidote, as he well knows.
- But considering the mood he's in...
- I understand.
Nitrogen breakdown commences
order of various components...
Stella, what are you doing?
Stella?
I'm in danger!
I'm in danger! Assistance!
Assistance! Danger.
I am in danger. Assistance!
Somebody come! Please!
Too late. Good-bye, Mallory.
You ready?
Mm-hmm.
- How's that?
- Fine. Just fine.
- Not too hard?
- No. Oh, no.
Maybe I shouldn't have
asked you to teach me judo...
until you'd fully recovered from teaching
20th-century battle strategy.
- Why don't we take a little break?
- Oh, okay.
Who's this?
Someone I knew...
a long, long time ago.
She's beautiful.
Yeah.
And you're only seeing the outside.
Excuse me.
It's your dime. Shoot.
Buck, I've been given to understand that
Colonel Deering is there. Is that correct?
Yes, Doctor Huer.
What's happened?
Please. Just come down
to the hospital research lab.
Plain and simple,
cold-blooded murder.
I'll never find the antidote now,
not without Carl.
Not without Carl.
Apparently, his assistant was
responsible. I gather she's disappeared?
Obviously, they don't want us
to find an antidote to the poison.
And they've succeeded in setting
our efforts back by days, even weeks.
Which means that Earth will remain
next to defenseless indefinitely.
There's still something we can do.
You see...
Oh, Buck. I'm sorry.
No offense,
but this deals directly
with the Defense Directorate,
and seeing as how you hesitate
to become a member.
Oh, yeah, sure.
You're right.
We found that all the food discs...
manufactured for Directorate
housing were contaminated.
Which means someone is trying
to incapacitate our squadrons.
Whoever was responsible
tried to obscure that fact
by allowing the disease
to crop up in other cities.
And not just here. We also found
that all the contaminated food discs,
no matter where they were processed or
distributed, have one thing in common...
- Vistula.
- What's Vistula?
Look, if what Wilma tells me is true,
we're in a lot of trouble.
And Earth in the 25th century
is better than no Earth at all.
- So count me in.
- Oh, that's fine, Buck.
So what is Vistula?
Vistula is an agricultural planet
just beyond Stargate 5...
in the Epsilon Ludi system.
It's where much of the vegetable protein
incorporated into our food is grown...
and where various other...
Vistula 2, this is Warden.
Do you read me?
Vistula 2, this is Warden. Do
you read me? We read you, Warden.
Tell Kaleel I have some good news.
So, you must ready yourselves,
my friends!
Your moment is at hand!
No longer shall you live
in a sea of stone...
while others reap the benefits
of our world's lush glory!
No longer shall you work...
to feed the people of distant planets...
while your own sons
and daughters go hungry!
Soon...
you will descend upon
the Earth like meteors,
like fire,
and consume them
with the flames...
of your righteous anger.
The only ones who can stop us...
are those enemies among us.
Those who are weak and faithless.
Those who do not believe,
those who attack me...
out of fear and jealousy.
These are our enemies.
Every moment...
you tolerate their presence
among us...
is a moment lost for you...
and your children
and your children's children!
I know of one!
Leila, no.
My husband.
He speaks against you
in the dead of night.
Lying beside me, he says you are the
one that makes us work for the governor.
He says you sell us
and keep the money.
He's afraid of the future,
afraid of dying for the cause,
afraid not for everyone else,
but for himself!.
Do not harm him!
You have nothing to fear.
My touch is the touch of truth,
the kiss of God.
If your heart is good and true,
you shall live.
- If not...
- Please, don't.
Leila, help me.
Leila, for God sakes, help me!
No! No!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
No one is to leave the hall. They're
gonna get another talk in half an hour.
You've heard from Stella?
She'll be landing shortly.
She says Earth's Defense Directorate stands
little chance of curing its ailing pilots...
until well after
we've launched our attack.
Good.
The Directorate, however,
is no different from any
other organization of people.
As long as its leader exists,
it is a threat,
as I'm sure you are well aware.
If you're referring to Dr. Huer,
Stella indicated he's
about to be taken care of.
Good.
I hear she is appointed
to the position every seven years.
Taybor Saroyan
is the current governor.
I don't understand, Dr. Huer.
Why would the governor of Vistula...
deliberately contaminate
the Directorate's food supply...
when his son is here
studying to be a pilot?
I don't know, Buck. It might well be
that he's unaware of what's happened.
Well, we know something is happening.
I say we go to Vistula and take a look.
I could call Governor Saroyan...
and suggest that Regis be returned
to Vistula to recuperate there.
And you could send us along
as an honor guard.
Could you be ready to leave
at 0700 tomorrow? Mm-hmm.
We would look more like an honor guard if we
could send along a couple of our best pilots.
Well, I really can't spare them,
but you'll have them.
Get down!
Don't either one of you
raise even a hair.
Good heavens!
What was that?
They sure don't make these
like they used to.
It's a sick suit.
It'll monitor his vital signs...
and administer proper treatment
intravenously.
He'll be feeling much better
by the time he reaches Vistula.
Good morning, you two.
Good morning, Doctor.
I just spoke with Governor Saroyan,
and he's expecting you.
We have the samples of the tracing agent
Dr. Mallory developed. We're all set.
Well, not quite yet.
Dr. Theopolis,
did you manage to come up with those
going-away presents for Buck and Wilma?
Ah, Theo, you shouldn't have.
Theo didn't. I did.
Ignore Twiki, everyone.
He was up all night putting these
together, and his circuitry is a bit frayed.
Those wristbands
will give you visual warning...
should the contamination you're
looking for start to enter your systems.
You can also monitor
each other's telemetry,
which means they'll also serve
as radio directional finders.
Good. That's better than a
graduation gift. Thank you, Twiki.
Anytime, Buck.
Ah, here come the pilots
who will serve as your escorts.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh?
Oh.
Major Fields, Captain Rogers.
Major.
And I understand that you two have
already bumped into each other.
They certainly have.
The problem is you and Duke
are too much alike.
I mean, once you get to know him,
he's really not that bad.
Come on, Buck.
Give him a chance.
I intend to.
How long have you known him?
Since flight school.
You close?
No, not anymore.
Was your moving up in rank
part of the problem?
That was the least of it.
- Care to elaborate?
- No.
Some things never change.
Coming up on Vistula.
We're cleared for landing.
Very good, Major. We'll
follow you in. There it is.
The entire planet is devoted
to growing vegetable protein.
We'll be going to the place where the food is
warehoused and processed for shipment to Earth.
- What's that barren area?
- It's a huge desert.
Vistula's first inhabitants called it
the Sea of Stone.
Nothing of any consequence
can grow there.
Saroyan's son has arrived.
The governor has prepared a banquet
for the copilots who escorted him here.
The fool has been so helpful to us,
he deserves to have a good time.
Just so he remains totally ignorant of
what's happening right under his nose.
He might not.
Dr. Huer survived
the attempt on his life.
What?
It could very well be he
knows the poisoned food...
...comes from Vistula and he's
sent these people here as spies.
Well, if they're staying at the
statehouse, we needn't worry.
Should they stray
too near the fire,
we'll simply see that it...
engulfs them.
Oh.
Oh, Julio,
this is such a festive occasion.
I can't remember enjoying myself
so much in years. Can you?
No, I can't, Governor.
Does everybody have enough wine?
Oh, yes.
Regis?
Are you sure you feel well enough to
join us? I mean, you do look awfully pale.
I'm fine, Father.
Just a little weak.
I am so grateful to you
for bringing Regis home.
My physicians tell me that he
received excellent care on Earth.
But your computers were unable
to diagnose his illness.
They think it's a virus.
Hopefully, by the time we leave here,
Dr. Huer will be able to relay
more information to you.
I'm not letting you leave,
you know,
not until you've had three days
of absolutely royal treatment.
- And a full tour of our production facilities.
- Of course.
We'd enjoy that.
No, thank you, Ryma.
Just water, if you please.
I'm afraid I couldn't keep
anything else down right now.
It isn't often that I have visitors
from my home world,
except for those
boring systems analysts,
and those dreadful investigators...
that the Food Directorate
periodically dispatches...
to check up on me.
As if after three
successive appointments to this job,
I was gonna slip up.
Come on now. Eat up! Eat up!
It isn't everyday that I have
a full meal brought in here from...
- What is the name of that place?
- Dionysin.
None of this food is from here?
Of course not.
I mean, you can imagine
how quickly one tires of soy products.
Oh, no. I have all
my food brought in. All of it.
An expense budgeted
into the governor's salary.
Come on now, Julio.
You speak as if these good people
were Food Directorate spies.
I'm afraid our friend has been a
little too long in the trenches.
Not too crazy
about his foreman either.
If looks could kill,
rigor mortis would be setting in.
Why haven't I seen any
mobile service modules anywhere?
Too expensive and unnecessary.
We virtually have a human
workforce at our fingertips.
All your operations are carried out by
people? I didn't know that was possible.
Not only possible,
but extremely practical.
The inhabitants of the Sea of Stone
make excellent workers.
Oh, some of them are a trifle difficult
right after their purchase, but I...
You buy people and force them
to work here against their will?
Oh. They are uncivilized nomads.
One of their own people...
a man called Kaleel...
he periodically gathers
a group of them together...
and sells them to us.
It is a very satisfactory arrangement.
It's slavery.
Slavery?
Even uncivilized nomads
have certain rights. You can't just...
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
No problem.
- Ryma, what do you think you are doing?
- It's all right.
My apologies, Captain Rogers. There is
absolutely no excuse for such clumsiness.
I expect more from statehouse servants
than from common field laborers.
Perhaps the fields
are more to your liking?
Governor, it is all right.
No harm has been done.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
You treat these people
as if they're machines. They're not.
They're human beings.
They make mistakes.
A very interesting notion.
I believe I've suggested something
similar to you in the past, Father.
<i>Strangers in the night</i>
<i>Exchanging glances</i>
<i>Wondering in the night</i>
<i>What were the chances</i>
<i>we'd be making love</i>
<i>Before the night was... </i>
My singing was that bad?
No. I have to talk to you.
There's someone outside trying to listen.
The music should cover
our conversation.
I wanted to thank you for what
you did tonight at the banquet.
No problem.
Did you really mean what
you said about slavery?
If I hadn't meant it,
I wouldn't have said it.
You said something about someone
listening outside. Who? Saroyan?
No, of course not.
It's my people I'm worried about,
the other workers,
Kaleel's followers.
Governor Saroyan is a fool.
The only one with any sense
in that family is his son, Regis.
Regis has tried for years
to help the nomads.
Yeah. You have a thing
for him, don't you?
- A thing?
- Um, a crush.
You like him.
Yeah. Let me get out of here.
I'm starting to wrinkle.
I'll check the door.
Okay.
I think he's still out there.
From what I understand about Kaleel,
he's some kind of a slave trader.
Doesn't sound like the kind of man
who would have followers.
He's more than just a slave trader.
He's a sorcerer.
Oh, come on.
No, it's true.
Kaleel feeds off
the adulation of a crowd.
He siphons off their love
and their energy.
Sorcerer, mutant,
call him what you will,
but he can mesmerize a group
with just his words and his...
How come you haven't fallen under his
spell? Some of us have escaped his will.
Not many, but a few.
My brother was one.
Last week, he told me he'd discovered something
terrible about the processing plant he worked in.
He was going to meet me
that night to tell me more.
He never came.
Kaleel had him murdered.
- Which processing plant?
- Number 347.
- Is it far? Can you show me how to get there?
- Yes.
Then you'll help me get rid of
Kaleel? I'm certainly gonna try.
Oh, there is one other thing.
I was supposed to be yours
for tonight.
And if they see you leave without me,
they're going to...
Oh, well, I'll leave by the window.
You stay here.
I've got a reputation
to uphold too, you know.
Oh, hello. Official business.
Food Directorate. Excuse me!
I'll be darned.
The poison's in the packaging.
Where did he go?
All I know is that
he wasn't pleased with me.
Oh, I see.
And so he left
through the window?
All right, Ryma,
I'm asking you for the last time.
What did you tell him?
Some story about your brother?
You murdered my brother!
What more story is there?
Did you tell him he worked
at the food plant?
Is that where Rogers is,
at the processing plant?
No, don't bother.
We'll take her back to the mountain.
Kaleel will make her talk.
Take her to the shuttle port. A transport is
scheduled to leave for the mountain at dawn.
Yes, sir.
Nighttime is for sleeping.
Did you see where he put
the locking mechanism? No.
You're Rogers's friend?
Yes. Colonel Deering.
I heard what you said about the processing
plant. It ties in with why we were sent here.
I'm sure it's a part of
Kaleel's great plan. What plan?
You'll find out soon enough, Colonel.
I'm sure Kaleel will answer
any questions you might have.
And you,
any questions he might have.
Ryma?
Ryma?
Are you all right?
We're on a ship that will take us across
the Sea of Stone to Kaleel's fortress.
There's no escape now.
Because of me, you're going to die,
Wilma, maybe Rogers too.
Wouldn't be too sure about that.
Why didn't I just close my eyes
and follow like all the rest?
Don't give up yet.
What are you doing?
Letting Buck know
he has a friend in need.
Hey, Buck.
Did you two have a nice, uh, chat?
Keep it down. Come in here.
When did Wilma leave
the governor's little get-together?
About two hours ago, same
as everybody else, except you.
Why? 'Cause she's missing,
along with a slave girl.
Something's happened to her? I'm afraid
so. She's activated her R.D.F. unit.
You can tell where she is with that thing?
Yeah. Northeast, about three kilometers.
Well, let's go get her.
Hold on.
It's not safe to try a subspace
communication between here and Earth.
And I've gotta get this poison sample
to Huer as quickly as possible.
Major Fields can do it.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
We're on our way. I hope your
friend, Buck, can say the same.
What is that glow
on the horizon? The sun?
By the time it reaches halfway to its
zenith, we'll be inside Kaleel's mountain.
Better hurry. I just ran
into one of Julio’s guards.
He's gonna be pretty upset when
he comes to. All right, okay.
You take off first. When you get to
Earth, tell Huer exactly what I told you.
Major, don't try using your radio
until you're well beyond the stargate.
Will do. Good luck, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Oops. Wilma's on the move.
It's going very slowly. Must be on
some kind of shuttle. Let's go.
We're almost there.
The shuttle's about to dock,
carrying Ryma and the woman
from Earth's Defense Directorate.
They're to be brought here.
Another thing. Julio said that
two of Earth's starfighters...
left the statehouse spaceport
15 minutes ago.
- We have one of them on the scope.
- The shuttle is being followed?
You're in charge of military operations,
Galen. What do you intend to do about it?
- Employ the power leech.
- Excellent.
Whatever Wilma was traveling in,
she stopped now.
You have any idea what we're gonna do
once we get wherever it is we're going?
- Nope.
- Just thought I'd ask.
What are you doing?
Our engines are shutting down.
Tell me something I don't know.
My P.C. gauges say we're putting out
more than enough energy.
But it's not going
where it's supposed to.
Somebody's using a power leech on us!
I don't know if I can keep her nose up!
Hit the retro-gravity valve!
It'll slow us down!
It's canceled out.
Any more ideas?
Not a one.
I don't understand.
Where have all our guests gone?
Colonel Deering, Major Fields,
Major Danton,
even that boorish Captain Rogers,
where have they gone?
You really don't know
what's going on here, do you?
Hmm?
I've tried to tell you for years.
About Kaleel.
The way he exploits the nomads,
how he makes them hate
the very sound of your name.
Now I have a job to do. And I've
always tried to do the best I could.
We've been through all this
before, Father. You never listen!
Not really.
Oh, Julio you listen to.
Julio, whose first loyalty
is to Kaleel.
But never to me.
You never listen to your own son.
So finally I gave up
trying to make you hear.
Please, Father.
For your sake, not mine.
Look around you.
See what's going on,
what has been going on for years.
The sooner you realize,
the less you'll be hurt.
Duke?
Duke!
Keep it down.
- What kind of landing you call that anyway?
- You still complaining?
No, I guess not.
She was a good ship, though.
All I want is one crack
at whoever brought us down like this.
Just one! Yeah, talk about
"No Trespassing" signs.
- Still got a fix on Wilma?
- Yeah. She's landed.
About 18 kilometers in that direction.
Well, we'd better get
our survival gear on.
Yeah.
Otherwise, we'll look like a couple
of brown-and-serve rolls at sunset.
We're being taken to Kaleel.
There's a place where he puts people
that are a threat to him.
No one knows what happens there
because no one's ever come back.
It might be different with you,
but I doubt if
he's going to have much to say to me.
I'll say good-bye now, Wilma. There'll
be plenty of time for that later.
Move it! Is optimism part
of your military training?
No, but I picked up a lot outside
the military. I said, move it!
I said, move it!
Run, Wilma!
This thing itches like crazy.
Take it off if you don't mind
getting third-degree sunburn.
You probably feel right at home
wearing yours. That's right.
I've seen pictures of people
and how they dressed in your time.
Yeah, well, your half-baked 25th-century
historians got things so messed up,
they don't know the difference
between a cowboy and a traffic cop.
Careful. Careful.
The filament you're soldering is the precise
weight and thickness as the one you're replacing.
Be very careful, Twiki.
It was very difficult to make.
Get off my back!
I'm not on your back, Twiki.
And please concentrate
on what you're doing.
If anything, I'm on your front,
and I can't get off without your help.
Where have you been coming up
with such expressions?
My good buddy, Buck.
I should have known.
It's hard to believe...
that Captain Rogers learned to speak
on the same planet as the rest of us.
That's very good, Twiki.
Dr. Mallory?
Would you send a light current through Carl's
higher-level associative circuits, please?
It won't do any good.
They've all been destroyed.
Please, Dr. Mallory.
The current?
What did I tell you?
Dr. Mallory, Major Fields
just brought this in from Vistula.
As you can see, the biochemical
poison that entered our food supply...
did so through the packaging material.
Ingenious.
Buck hoped that a sample of
concentrated poison like this...
might help you come up
with an antidote.
It would've, Major.
But without Carl, it does me no good.
No good at all.
Why, you self-pitying old goat!
- Carl?
- Who else would it be, you ignoramus?
Nice to see you again, Mallory.
We'll get started on that antidote
right away.
Good. The Defense Directorate
has so few pilots now...
that Earth could scarcely ward off an attack
from pirates, let alone anything organized.
So keep me apprised of your progress.
I shall. I shall.
Let's leave Dr. Mallory
to his work, Twiki.
I owe you a great deal, Theopolis.
Thank you.
You mean, you owe Twiki and me
a great deal, Carl.
And it's quite all right.
Another one
of Buck's colorful phrases, Twiki?
Why did you kill your brother, Ryma?
The governor's foreman says
he was found dead...
after the workers say
he went off to meet with you.
Whatever he had to tell you must not
have liked. That's what the workers say.
So that's how you
twisted it around for them?
And that's how you'll explain
my sudden disappearance.
There's something wrong with you, Ryma.
Your brother was the same way. You
never fit in. You were always different.
Always complaining,
always unhappy.
No one will miss you
too terribly, you know.
Go ahead! Kill me!
Give me your touch of death.
But don't you ever forget, Kaleel,
that I knew the truth.
Our enemy isn't Saroyan or Earth.
It's you!
You stole our dreams.
You took away everything we might've been.
Maybe you can suck the dreams
out of all those others, but not me.
You never got to me, Kaleel,
and don't you ever forget that.
You are evil, Ryma.
The evil and the weak must be purged.
Go on, kill me! I'd rather be
dead than one of your zombies.
No!
You are truly evil, Ryma.
The kiss of God would only sanctify you,
even in death.
I won't give you that. Take her to
the furnace. You know what to do.
The woman from Earth's Defense
Directorate hasn't been found yet.
Did you double the guards at the exits?
No, there's no need.
I've worked with these people from Earth,
and I know how they think.
She won't try to escape.
Not just yet.
You're not eating.
You don't like my cooking?
It's pretty hard to eat something
that just crawled on the ground.
I prefer my food pills.
It's up to you. You wanna take a chance
on being poisoned, go right ahead.
Remember all the times
I've called you a barbarian?
Well, I don't take any of'em back.
Not one.
No, don't do anything yet.
What do they want? Just about
anything they can get their hands on.
Hey creep...
I bet you wear that mask 'cause your face
looks like it's been through a meteor shower!
Either they agree with me,
or they don't understand a word I'm saying.
Okay, how do you wanna
handle this?
You take the two on your side,
I'll take the two on mine, all right?
Whatever you say.
Okay. Let's go!
I got him!
Watch it!
Watch it!
Don't forget to write.
Buck.
Buck, you were terrific!
You know something, Duke?
You weren't half bad yourself.
What do you say we pick these
things up and go after Wilma, okay?
Sure.
Ah, Buck!
Look what happened to your dinner.
That's okay.
I was, uh, on a diet anyway.
This ought a come in handy.
Instead of running, she headed straight
for a transmitter to get word back to Earth.
What did I tell you?
Predictable to a fault,
these Earth people.
One of whom you used to be
until not long ago.
I became one of you so that someday
I could help overcome you.
And that day has arrived, Colonel Deering.
- That's where Wilma is, all right.
- Inside that mountain.
You think Kaleel's in there too?
I don't know.
I got a feeling...
Wilma's very close to the reason
Kaleel's poisoning Earth's food supply.
Buck...
how can we be sure
that Wilma is still alive?
Because I'm still getting
a signal on this.
This thing runs on body heat.
Don't worry, Duke.
We'll find her.
Wait a minute.
Do you see something?
Do you believe that?
I think we're looking at
the second part of Kaleel's master plan.
And with no air defenses,
how can Earth stand up to that?
Once Kaleel has weakened enough of our
pilots by contaminating their food supply,
he intends to launch
a massive attack on Earth.
With that number of ships,
it'd be devastating.
The only chance that Earth has...
it to get up here and launch
a secret strike against that airfield.
Those ships have gotta be destroyed
before they get off the ground.
Problem is,
how do we get word to Huer?
Which one of us can get the most out of
one of those babies down there, you or me?
All bragging aside, I could.
I'll transmit ahead...
once I get through the stargate.
Then I'll have to land, fuel up...
and get back here...
with just about
as many pilots as we have left.
Thanks.
Yeah, but the same thing they used to
knock us down with, they could use on you.
No. I'll go right to translight velocity.
They'll never catch me.
Find Wilma.
First thing I gotta do
is find my way inside that mountain.
But I'll find Wilma.
Don't worry about it.
Good luck, Major.
Same to you, Captain.
You said no one ever survived
a crash in the desert.
No one ever has before. Then
who's stealing one of our ships?
He's gone translight.
I need more time.
Ah! He got away.
It simply moves my timetable up, that's all.
But Earth will be alerted
to our attack.
This is why, isn't it? This is giving
off some kind of a homing signal.
It hardly matters anymore, Stella.
By tomorrow, she will have met the same fate as
Ryma, and we shall be the rulers of the Earth.
Yes, but according to Julio,
there were two people in that crash.
That fighter can hold only one,
which means someone is still around.
With this, I have a way of getting him,
don't I?
I didn't say I need
all the pilots you could spare, Dr. Huer.
I said I need all the pilots, period!
Major Danton,
I just can't do that.
I cannot order that Earth
be left absolutely defenseless.
And I'm telling you that if the fleet I saw back
there lifts off, the Earth is done for anyway.
Dr. Mallory has indicated that
he's very close to finding an antidote.
Now, if you could just wait one more day.
I could, sure. But the people
in that desert aren't going to.
We have to move now
with everything we've got.
Very well.
I'll discuss it with Dr. Theopolis.
Just make sure every available pilot
is waiting for me in that flight hangar.
Danton out. There's really
nothing to discuss, you know.
Major Danton is right.
It's just that he's talking about
so few pilots. He simply has no idea.
However, as you've indicated,
we have no choice.
I will scramble what's left of our forces.
Hmm? What was that, Twiki?
Oh, nothing, Doctor.
Excuse us, won't you?
We'll, uh,
see you on the flight deck.
Thank you for your help.
Certainly.
I must say, Twiki,
that was the best idea
you ever had.
I must be rubbing off on you.
This what you're looking for?
What's the matter?
Don't you like surprises?
Not particularly, no.
Major Danton. Welcome home. What you
should be saying is, "Have a nice flight,"
because I'll be leaving just as soon
as the rest of the pilots arrive.
I see.
You look like you have
some bad news for me, Dr. Huer.
I've scrambled all available pilots, Major.
- Well, when are they due to get here?
- They are here.
This is it?
I'm afraid so.
Brigadier Gordon here has come
out of retirement for this mission.
Your face looks familiar.
You were my instructor
in pulsar cannon, sir.
Ah, yes.
Fifteen years ago.
Fifteen years ago.
- Good to have you back, sir.
- It's good to be back, Major.
Excepting for these pilots, everyone else is
just too ill to be of any use to you, Major.
- Six pilots, huh?
Seven. Can't you count?
- Reporting for duty, Major Danton.
- This is too much.
As Twiki reminded me earlier,
I am thoroughly familiar
with our starfighters, Major.
Don't forget,
I helped design them.
And difficult as it was for me to do,
I've adjusted my input circuits...
to respond to you
as if you were my superior.
All right, all right.
You can come along.
- Hot dog!
- We've wasted enough time as it is.
We launch in five minutes.
Good luck, to all of you.
Sorry, Buck.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no thanks to our host.
The almighty Kaleel, I presume.
Mmm. And you are?
- Captain Buck Rogers.
- Ah.
What have you done
with the other girl, Ryma?
She has been put to death.
What will your friend do when
he returns to Earth, Captain Rogers?
Let's see. You've seen the fleet I've
been slowly, patiently building up,
and you've no doubt concluded that my plan
is to weaken Earth's defense squadrons...
by poisoning its members,
so the planet
can be conquered with ease.
Murder seems to be
second nature to you.
Why didn't you wipe us all out
so you can walk into power?
Mass death would've caused much alarm,
attracted too much attention.
Dr. Huer would have suspected
foul play immediately.
This way, the gravity of the situation
crept up on him.
And by the time he had an inkling of
what was truly happening, it was too late.
That's not the reason.
The truth is, you get your kicks...
out of turning people who should
logically hate you into mindless zombies...
who follow you around shouting your name.
Stop it!
Let's just get rid of him.
Rest assured,
he and Colonel Deering
will meet the same fate as Ryma.
But first things first.
Now that Earth knows of my plan,
what do your people intend to do?
Prepare for your attack, naturally.
And with our remaining forces,
we'll give you a reception
you'll not soon forget.
You are lying!
Your friend will lead your forces
back here...
in hopes of destroying my fleet
on the ground.
Pass the word.
We'll prepare to launch our attack today.
If Earth's paltry forces are on the way,
they'll be greeted by 100 fighters.
Yes, but each one of our pilots
is an expert.
Yours are not conditioned
to think for themselves.
Only to follow.
True.
But consider the quality
of leadership.
Haven't you recognized this man
as yet, Colonel Deering?
He is the person
who will orchestrate our attack.
Positioned behind all others,
Galen!
Galen?
He will tell each and every pilot
exactly what to do.
Galen.
He was the best military strategist
Earth had.
Then seven years ago, we heard that his
talents could be bought for the right price.
Suddenly, he disappeared.
Quite selfishly, we hoped he was dead.
Instead, I'm here,
about to spearhead an attack...
that will completely destroy
Earth's remaining forces.
Your friend expects to surprise us.
Just imagine the surprise
that's in store for him!
Punch in course seven-X...
four-nine-zero.
See you up there.
We're next, Twiki.
Here we go.
Geronimo!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Howdy Doody must be
taking the stage again.
Ryma!
She's still alive.
For whatever that's worth.
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
The time is now!
The time has come for you
to sail into battle and be victorious!
Earth is about to fall victim
to its own greed.
Soon, you shall meet those...
who have exploited you
for so long,
and you shall defeat them!
No longer shall you live
in caverns and canyons.
All Earth's wealth...
is yours for the taking!
Having suffered so long
at Saroyan's hand,
you deserve the Earth!
Listen to Galen.
Do what he says.
And don't be afraid.
Only the weak are afraid.
And as long as I am with you,
as long as the kiss of God...
is on your heads,
you shall...
prevail!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
Kaleel! Kaleel!
Looking good back there.
We'll be at the stargate
in approximately 12 minutes.
Seven, you're falling out of formation.
It was your idea to come along.
The least you can do is keep up.
Understood, Major Danton.
We're adjusting our course accordingly.
We've drifted
two degrees starboard, Twiki.
Pay attention to what you're doing.
Roger.
What about Rogers?
What do you think
all these pipes are for, Wilma?
Water, maybe,
pumped from underground springs.
Maybe they passed it through here
to warm it up.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- And these holes?
- Warm air vents.
That means they lead
to other rooms.
If these pipes carry water,
that means they're good and strong.
And one of these holes can carry us out
of here. How are you gonna get up there?
Fly?
That's not a bad idea.
What is that?
25th-century cherry bomb.
Now, all I need
is something to put it under.
What are you gonna do with it?
Preferably put it under
a tin bucket.
- Now, keep your face turned away.
- You've gotta be kidding.
You're not kidding.
I hope this timer works.
Whew!
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
He knows what he's doing.
He'll be back.
Hey, come on.
Don't leave me now. Stay with me.
Just in time, Julio.
And how is the good governor?
Just as ignorant
and, um, terribly upset.
It seems that all of his guests
left last night without saying a word.
I expect you
to keep us informed, Galen.
- And entertained.
- <i>That I shall. </i>
The screen in front of you will allow
you to track us as far as the stargate.
Beyond that,
we'll be on transmission only.
Leader to Squadron.
Prepare to launch.
- Kaleel?
- Later.
It begins.
Yes.
For us.
For Earth, it ends.
Two minutes to stargate.
Remember, once we pass through,
no further transmissions.
We do everything
exactly as I laid it out.
Are there any questions?
Good. Leader out.
I think I'm behaving myself
quite admirably, don't you?
I'm being respectful.
I'm following orders.
I'm not even going to analyze
Major Danton's attack strategy.
You're a real trooper.
I'd like to think so.
Ryma, can you hear me?
Yes, I'm fine.
Hi, girls.
At the end of this shaft
is a nice, cool storage room.
How's she doing?
She's better.
I think I can make it.
Bring her across this ledge...
and right down beneath the hole here.
I'll throw you a rope.
Okay? Now, be careful.
That's it.
Watch it, now.
Okay.
Now, put this around you.
I'll pull you up one at a time.
Put that around yourself,
then put the rope on top of it.
All right.
All right, Wilma, you're next.
Oh!
Approaching stargate.
Punch in destination 4807-K.
Let's get out of here, huh?
Great. Let's go.
It appears the armada has left
the ground and is waiting for us.
We failed, Twiki.
For the first time,
I agree with you.
Duke's on his way.
We gotta warn him.
Why don't we try making a run
for those last two fighters?
Sounds good to me.
Come on, Ryma.
No, my friends.
There are others who feel as I do.
Over the past few months,
we've stolen weapons and explosives.
If I can convince them that we have a
chance, maybe we can do something to help.
What kind of chance are you gonna have?
There couldn't be more than a dozen of you.
This is my world, Buck.
My people.
I deserve the chance to fight for them...
just as you deserve
the chance to fight for yours.
Okay, good luck.
Good luck, Ryma.
Wanna go get those fighters?
We'll have to take
the pilots out as well if we do.
- They'll never know what hit them.
- Okay.
Leader to Squadron.
I'm breaking radio silence.
You've no doubt seen on your scanners
what lies ahead of us.
We're too late. The armada on Vistula
is in the process of taking off.
And before we reach the combat vector,
we'll be outnumbered
almost ten to one.
But it's no use turning back.
They're on their way to Earth.
We either fight them here
or we fight them there.
So ready your pulsar cannons.
We're going to take them on now.
And before we're through with them,
they will have had
one big fight on their hands.
Right on!
You didn't have to take out
both guards, Wilma.
- I got excited.
- I think I've created a monster.
Nine-three and nine-four,
you're out of sequence.
You've disrupted the pattern,
and you're off course.
Adjust to 309. Do you read?
Nine-three and nine-four, respond!
You're off course.
You're headed directly for the enemy.
Adjust to 309 at once.
Nine-three to Leader.
With all due respect, Galen,
stick it.
One of our fighters seems
to be trying to intercept them.
If you're listening, Kaleel,
the three of us would just like to say
we didn't care much for the sauna.
That's Rogers!
Ah, Stella. You're so
beautiful when you're angry.
- He's escaped!
- It doesn't matter.
Any way we can raise
Duke on this thing, Colonel?
He should be on vector 92.4.
Buck Rogers to Earth Squadron Leader.
Rogers to Leader.
Do you read?
Major, it's a trick.
Rogers to Leader.
Do you read me?
Buck Rogers to Squadron Leader.
Rogers to Leader. Do you read me?
I read somebody, but that somebody's flying
an enemy ship and leading another one.
- Come on, Duke, it's me.
- If you're Rogers, who's the Juice?
- The what? J. Simpson. I told you
all about him out in the desert.
Running back out of USC.
He played for the Buffalo Bills.
Well, what are you waiting for, Captain
Rogers? Get your butt in formation.
I take it you're referring
to mine as well, Major?
Wilma!
I mean, Colonel Deering.
Right on both counts.
- <i>What do you say, Buck?</i>
- Twiki?
We're both here, Captain Rogers.
Welcome home, as it were.
Well, thanks, Theo.
Now, listen. There's only one
guy out here who means anything.
He's way in the back,
and he's running the whole show.
You see him on the scanner?
If we knock him out, the rest
will turn tail. I guarantee it.
Sounds like you're the red dog who's
gonna be sacking the quarterback.
- You got it.
- Okay, Squadron, in we go.
And listen to Buck.
He's calling the plays.
- The squadron from Earth?
- That is correct.
Eight?
There's only eight of them.
Eight of them against all of us?
All right, now keep your eyes on that
turkey in the back. He's the one we want.
We'll go right up the middle.
You guys open a hole, I'll nail him.
Okay, guards, take out these tackles.
What are they doing?
These Earth people fight like madmen!
Madmen or not,
it seems to be working.
Prepare my personal cruiser.
Just to be safe.
Go!
- Duke, coming at you, 2.00!
- I see him.
- I got him.
- I believe we're being pursued.
Curse you, Red Baron!
Stop them, you fools!
Hey, nice double-teaming over there,
whoever you are.
- Gordon's the name. Thanks.
- Have we met, Gordon?
I don't think so, Captain.
We're from different times.
I told you. Kaleel has
called for his escape craft.
This is our chance.
It's our only chance.
Ryma, there are so few of us.
And so few of them.
Most of them are out in space.
This is our chance
while the armada is losing,
and Kaleel is uncertain.
All right, let's go.
Come on! Let's go!
It's ready.
Eat lead, sucker!
Lead? What lead?
Twiki, what are you talking about?
There's your hole, Red Dog.
Quarterback's all yours.
Your challenge is accepted!
Galen!
They've lost Galen.
The armada's just
breaking apart and running!
My cruiser.
I must get to my cruiser.
Buck, we did it!
We did it! It worked!
We did it!
Nice shooting, Captain Rogers.
Thanks, Major. Twiki.
Gordon, where'd you learn
to shoot like that?
I've been doing that sort of thing
since before you were born, Captain.
You think so, huh?
Young man, I know so.
Come on, gang. We got some
cleaning up to do downstairs.
Tie them up!
How did this happen?
The woman, Ryma, she and the others
stole some weapons, explosives.
They're coming for you.
How did it happen?
Kaleel, your cruiser.
Come!
You...
are a dead man,
Rogers.
I am?
Don't be afraid of him.
The only way he can harm you
is if you're afraid of him.
That's right. That's why you couldn't
kill Ryma with your evil powers, isn't it?
Stay back.
'Cause she didn't believe in you.
Even those who hated you
believed in you.
So, of course, they died.
Stay back!
Your people's fate is all that's
real, isn't it? Not your power.
Stay back!
Go ahead, Kaleel.
Kill me if you can.
By the way, I know where
you can get a good lawyer.
I was being used by Kaleel,
by Julio, by everyone.
I had no idea.
Obviously, I am totally unsuited
for this position.
The Food Directorate will have
my resignation within the hour.
You're making
the same mistake as always.
Quit avoiding responsibility.
Clean up things on Vistula yourself.
I can't!
I don't know how.
Regis does.
I think part of the reason
he was taking that cadet training...
was to avoid those things he saw happening
on Vistula and could do nothing about.
I always listened to Julio.
Hmm. Never to my own son.
I can't blame you
for hating me all these years.
But now...
Will you help me now?
You and Ryma both.
Of course we will.
I have a feeling Vistula
is in very good hands.
I think that means
we're excused.
You know, I feel like celebrating.
Let's do something tonight.
Oh, I'm sorry, Buck.
I already have plans.
Oh. Well, how about you?
I'm the one she's got plans with.
