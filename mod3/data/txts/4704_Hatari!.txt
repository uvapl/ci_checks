Kurt, can you hear me?
Go ahead, Sean.
At about 11 o'clock,
in the middle
of that herd of wildebeest.
See him?
Oh, that's a good one.
Let's go. Start out easy.
Okay, Pockets.
Kwende.
This one
must be female.
She can't decide
which way to go.
Tell Kurt to let her run,
wear her down.
Kurt, Sean says give her
a little exercise.
That's what we'll do.
Tell us
when you want her.
Tell Kurt
to take his time.
This one's mean.
Take your time, Kurt.
Try her, Pockets.
Move in a little closer.
Moving in.
Watch her!
Don't lose her!
The rhino
got the Indian.
Swing around.
Swing around.
Bring the first aid kit.
Are you trying
to get a vacation?
He hooked me good.
Why didn't
you shoot him?
I didn't know he planned
to ride with us.
You can fix
that, Pockets.
Oh, a big Band-Aid
will do it.
Do you want to
stretch out?
I'll sit up.
Room, please.
Tough luck.
My fault.
I messed it up.
How was it your fault?
I was driving,
wasn't I?
The Indian could
have shot him.
Find him again.
I'll shoot him.
Sean, we'd better
get him to a hospital.
Get him into
the catching truck.
Luis.
Give him a hand.
Zidia bwana.
Kwende.
Kurt.
Calling Arusha control.
Calling Arusha control.
[Woman On Radio]
Arusha control speaking. Go ahead.
This is Sean Mercer.
We have a man that's
been horned by a rhino.
He's bleeding
pretty badly.
Would you alert
Dr. Sanderson
that we'll be in
to the Arusha hospital
about 5 hours
from now?
Will do.
Anything else? Over.
That's all.
Over and out.
That hole
looks very bad.
It don't look good.
After we get out
of this crater,
you'd better push on
ahead to the compound
and pick up Brandy.
She'd want to be
at the hospital.
(sing)(sing) [Men Singing In Swahili]
Arga, where's missy?
In room.
We're all
going into town.
The Indian bwana
got hurt.
Bad?
I don't know yet.
Get me some coffee.
[Knock On Door]
Come in.
Hi, Kurt.
You're back early.
Is something wrong?
Yeah. The Indian.
A rhino gored him
in the leg.
- Oh, no.
- He lost a lot of blood.
They are taking him
to hospital.
Must we hurry?
No. I came ahead.
There's plenty of time.
Thanks for coming for me.
Help me with my zipper.
It's stuck.
Come over with me.
How did it happen?
Was it the same way
my father was killed?
No. We hadn't
put a rope on him.
How, then?
It was my fault.
I got too close.
The engine was
spitting a little.
I took the chance,
and the Indian got hurt.
You all take chances.
That's part of the job.
Yes, but I shouldn't
have taken that one.
And to pull
this thing up here,
I'm only afraid of
ripping something.
- [Zipper Zipping]
- Here you are.
Thank you.
I'll get a coat.
How long
does it take?
As long as it takes.
To tell whether a man
can live or not?
Patience, my boy.
Patience.
A sterling virtue.
I wish I had more of it.
All we can do is wait.
Let's don't start
climbing the walls.
Who's got
a cigarette?
- That yours?
- Thanks.
Which one
is Sean Mercer?
I am.
I hear you've
got a job open.
What job?
They said in town
you'd be needing a man.
Well, you're in a rush.
Is he asking
for the Indian's job?
He's not dead yet.
I know that.
I asked for the job
because if I waited,
someone else might get it.
You'd better get out of here.
I'm not talking to you.
Kurt, take it easy.
When a fella's hungry...
Cut it out!
Stop it, will you?
You can't whip us all.
- I can try.
- Well, bring your lunch.
What's going on here?
I have a patient already.
I don't want any more.
How is he, Sandy?
How's the Indian?
Not good.
Did it have
to be the Indian?
- What do you mean?
- We didn't arrange it.
You seem to take turns
at getting banged up.
I wish it were
someone else this time.
You all have
standard-type blood.
The Indian has
to be different.
He needs a transfusion?
Plasma is not doing the job.
I need whole blood.
AB-negative is not
very easy to find.
[Chuckling]
What is that for?
I was thinking,
you were in
too much of a hurry.
Young man,
I don't understand.
We're talking
about blood type.
Exactly.
You mean that is
your blood type?
That's right.
The Indian's luck
hasn't run out.
If you'd be willing
to come with me...
He'll be willing.
I will?
If you want that job.
I don't want
anything from you.
You won't
give him blood?
I didn't say that,
but I don't
like to be told.
You have to ask me.
I ask you, please.
I'm sorry, mademoiselle,
but he's going to
have to ask me.
All right.
I'm asking you.
This is the way
you ask, huh?
Where do I go, Doctor?
In there.
Tomorrow come out
to our place.
He won't be going
anywhere tomorrow.
When he gets
through with you,
come out, and we'll
talk about that job.
I'll think about it.
Where did you say to go?
Second door on the left.
Just tell the nurse
to get you ready.
Who is he?
I don't know,
but I'm glad he's here.
How long before
you can tell us
about the Indian?
2 or 3 hours.
In the meantime,
do me a big favor.
- Sure, Doc. Anything.
- Get out of here.
Leave me in peace.
Go have a drink.
I think the Indian
will be all right.
We'll be
at the Safari Bar.
On my way.
[Telephone Rings]
Safari Bar.
Yes, sir. They're here.
Hello, Doc.
How's the Indian?
Did he have
a tough time?
Everything all right?
Nothing went wrong, did it?
He don't say anything.
Give him a chance.
Go ahead, Doc.
Uh-huh.
Ha ha ha!
He would.
Thanks, Doc.
The Indian asked
for a drink...
and made a pass
at the nurse.
He'll live.
Thanks, Doc.
We'll call tomorrow.
Youman,
another round.

Breakfast at 6:00.
That's a challenge
we'll try to meet.
Good night, everybody.
Good night, Brandy.
Dead ahead, sailor.
Aye, aye, sir.
[Crash]
Good night.
Before you go
any further,
I should tell you
that you're not alone.
Well, I waited for you.
The houseboy was gone,
and it was getting late.
Hi.
I had to sleep somewhere,
and I just picked a room.
I suppose I picked yours.
I hope you don't mind.
I don't mind.
Who are you?
- Anna Maria D'Allesandro.
- What?
Anna Maria D'Allesandro,
and who are you?
Well, I'm Sean Mercer,
but what are you doing here?
Trying to get some sleep.
I mean, how come, uh...
You did not expect me?
I sure didn't.
What's that for?
I wanted to see if...
I wanted to see
if I was seeing things.
You have been
drinking a little.
No, ma'am.
I've been drinking a lot.
Sean, I want
to talk to you
about tomorrow morning.
Don't you think that 6...
I want to talk to you
about tomorrow...
Sean, is there
somebody in your bed?
Yes, there is.
What did you
want to say to me?
I had something
important to say.
Can't remember
what it is.
- Who is she?
- I don't know.
What's she doing here?
Do you have some bicarb...
He doesn't know who she is.
- Why is she in his bed?
- He doesn't know.
I didn't say that.
- What did you say?
- I don't know.
- That's exactly what you said.
- What?
- I don't know.
- Why didn't you say so?
You're getting me
mixed up. You said...
- Let's start all from the start.
- Please. Please. Please.
I had a long trip.
I would like to get some sleep.
- Wouldn't you?
- I certainly would.
No, no, no. Who are you,
and why are you in his bed?
Let's leave it
until tomorrow morning.
I think
the lady's right.
We can face it
in the morning
with clear heads.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Sean.
Thanks for the use
of your room.
I didn't have much
to say about it, did I?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Anybody want
one of these?
Black coffee.
[Cup Rattles]
Morning. Good morning.
Good morning, Sean.
Jumbo, Arga.
Jumbo!
What do we got
for breakfast this morning?
Bacon and eggs?
Ah, my favorite...
Codfish cakes
deep-fried in antelope fat.
What's the matter?
Isn't anybody eating?
Please, Pockets,
not this morning.
- Go away or shut up.
- Preferably both.
He's not human. Anybody that
can drink that much and not feel it.
Boy, we sure had
a big night last night.
- You remember?
- I'm going on the wagon.
- Why?
- I'm beginning to see things.
I thought I saw a girl
in Sean's room last night.
You saw a girl.
That's what I said.
Pockets,
you did see a girl.
I did?
You did.
Good. Now I don't...
Who was she?
- I don't know.
- Don't start that.
- Start what?
- I don't know.
He said there was
a girl in your room.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, Pockets.
Look what I found
in the living room...
cameras, lenses...
a real professional outfit.
- Your roommate.
- Professional.
- Photographer.
- Didn't the Indian get a letter
from some photographer?
Yeah, from a zoo
in Switzerland.
Basel, wasn't it?
Yeah, but that was
signed by a man.
[Sean]
Go get the letter.
Sean, what does he mean,
your roommate?
The girl that was
in my bed last night.
Sean!
Well, I didn't know her!
What was she doing
in your bed?
I don't know.
Here it is.
It's signed on the bottom.
"A.M. D'Alles..."
D'Allesandro.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I don't think
I've met everybody.
We'd better
introduce ourselves.
They call me Pockets.
They tell me
we met last night.
I remember you.
Who wears the other half
of your pajamas?
I do.
My name is Kurt Mueller.
I know you.
I covered the Le Mans race.
You should have won.
That crash, too bad.
I don't know.
He walked away from it.
My name is
Luis Francisco Garcia Lopez.
I don't wear pajamas.
This is our boss,
Miss de la Corte.
We call her Brandy.
I'm not really
their boss.
They were
my father's friends.
Now we all
work together.
I know
of your father.
One doesn't work
around the zoo
without hearing of
Frenchy de la Corte.
Thank you.
Kurt, Luis, help me
to check the truck.
Yes, boss.
Will you have
some breakfast?
Thank you.
Just coffee.
Would you like
some codfish cakes?
No, thank you.
- Miss D'Allesander...
- D'Allesandro.
Make it Dallas.
It's easier.
Thank you.
Did you sign this letter?
Yes, of course.
Why?
Because A.M. D'Allesandro
sounds like a man.
You mean because I'm a girl,
I can't do the job?
No. I mean
we've got trouble enough.
Find out what kind
of girl I am
before you
make up your mind.
I wish I had time.
Miss de la Corte
goes out with you.
But she was raised here.
She can drive as well
as anyone except Kurt.
She can shoot as well
as anyone except the Indian.
- Can you handle a gun?
- No.
- Have you ever been hunting?
- [Clucks Tongue]
- Have you ever been to Africa?
- No, I haven't.
I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding,
but there isn't time to...
take care of
an amateur, huh?
That's what
I was going to say.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.
I hate to do this.
I would prefer
that you wanted me.
Here is a letter
from the director
of the zoo.
The boom is
about to be lowered.
That zoo will buy
most of your animals this season.
They want pictures
of the catchings.
The boom has been lowered.
How long will it take you
to get your pictures?
As long as it takes you
to catch your animals.
I'm ready to start.
That's a funny-looking
work outfit.
Suit yourself.
We're ready to go.
You won't wait 5 minutes?
I can wait a few minutes.
I can catch up with you, Sean.
What's the matter?
I say something wrong?
- I don't know.
- Nobody knows anything.
Where are
we going today?
Manyara, I guess.
What are you going to do,
carry her stuff?
Don't start in by spoiling her.
Yes, Bwana.
Jumbo.
[Men]
Jumbo.
Habari iko?
Misuri sana.
All set, Brandy?
All set.
Let's get under way.
Twende!
Pockets, don't wait
all day for her.
Yes, Bwana.
Yes.
Dallas, let's go!
[Dallas]
I'll be right out.
Get my stuff, will you?
All aboard!
I'm coming!
Hi.
I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.
Aren't we going?
Let's go!
Where are we going today?
Yeah.
I said, where...
Look out!
I didn't see
that darn thing.
How does
the ground seem?
Could be better.
Some gullies over there.
If we get after
a good one,
stick around
and hold him
if I miss
the first time.
Will do.
- Give me that pad.
- May I stand back there?
You'd better stay inside.
That ground's pretty rough.
I'll be all right.
I like to move around.
You'll move around,
all right.
Chunga memsahib.
What did you say?
I told them
to take care of you.
Tell them I can
take care of myself.
Okay.
Watcha memsahib.
A kili mengi.
Maybe.
[Chuckling]
Luis,
handle the pole!
Pockets,
you pick me a big one,
and I'll
make you eat it.
I'll be
very careful, Bwana.
Start out easy.
Why don't they catch
the big ones?
The last one
Pockets chose
tried getting
into Sean's lap.
Pockets thought
he was coming through
the windshield.
When he ducked,
he hit an anthill.
Aah!
Take this one!
Take this one,
Pockets!
Aah!
Tell Kurt to let it go.
Herding car.
Herding car.
Let him go.
Sean's having noose trouble.
Was that giraffe to your liking,
Sahib Master Bwana?
Get another one
the same size!
- What happened?
- What?
- What happened?
- Nothing yet.
- Knock on it!
- Ohh!
Pockets!
Aah!
Aah!
You better stay there!
Take this one!
Get ready to shake
hands with him!
All right.
Poli, poli.
Slow it down.
Easy, easy.
Slow it down.
Easy.
Come on!
Hurry it up!
She's a handful
of trouble!
[Grunting]
You get enough room
to move around?
Oh, shut up!
Ah-ha!
All right.
Well, how is it?
Terrible.
I feel sore all over.
- The best thing now is a hot bath.
- Thank you.
- Come on.
- Thanks, Pockets.
- Put your things in the building.
- Okay.
Brandy, I just want
to say something.
You might not think so,
but I had a great day,
only I made
a fool of myself.
I'm sorry.
I apologize to everyone.
I'd like to stay,
if you'll let me,
but I don't want
to force you.
Just forget about
the letter I showed you.
If you want me to go,
just tell me. I'll go.
Thanks for listening.
Well, gentlemen,
who's going to tell her to go?
Rhino, elephants,
buffalo...
and a greenhorn.
Well, if that's the way
you want it.
Wakea bowani.
(sing) La la la la (sing)
- [Growling]
- [Gasps]
[Groans]
Mamma mia!
[Screams]
Help!
Oh!
Help!
Stand perfectly still.
Don't move.
I think
I can save you.
Get back! Back!
Back!
Thank you!
Okay. Get back!
- What the...
- What's going on here?
What's this
Clyde Beatty routine?
What's he doing
to you, Sonya,
poking a chair
at you?
Come on, get out.
You don't
belong here anyway.
Here.
That's a girl.
Pockets, aren't you
ashamed of yourself?
Dallas screamed.
I saw the cheetah.
It looked too good
to pass up,
so I thought l...
- I was wrong.
- I think you were right.
- And stay out of here!
- Yes, ma'am!
(sing)(music)(music) [Music Playing]
[Purring]
Hi, Sonya.
Oh, nice.
- Can I give you a hand?
- No. I just want to file these.
Why don't you go in
and join the fun?
I don't belong in there.
I had all the fun
I can take for one day.
I've been banged
on every part of my body,
from bottom to top.
I had a bath with
a cheetah and 3 men.
I'll sit for a while.
About that
not belonging,
they decided if you
want to stick around,
it's all right.
Well, I'm glad of that
because...
You said "they."
Did you vote against me?
I told you I thought
you'd be a damn nuisance.
Yeah. You did.
And I was today, wasn't I?
You were, but at
least you knew it.
That was
a nice speech,
but I don't
think you can
talk your way
out of it again.
Hi. Care for
some company?
Yes. Why not?
I wouldn't blame you
if you didn't.
We were a little
rough on you today.
I had it coming.
Would you like a drink?
Just sit down
and talk to me.
Thank you, Sonya.
Well, what'll we
talk about?
My favorite subject?
- What?
- Me.
All right.
We'll talk about you.
I noticed today when
everybody was jumping around
and wrestling
with this giraffe,
you were just sitting
in the car laughing.
Why?
Because the giraffe
was out there.
Why?
A giraffe has spots,
a zebra has stripes,
and a lion
is all one color.
What are you
talking about?
Dallas, any animal
that has spots, stripes,
or is one color...
any color...
I don't go near.
You don't like
animals.
Oh, I like animals,
all right.
I'm just
scared of them.
But, Pockets,
you drove right in
with all these
giraffes around.
What color
is a giraffe?
Mostly yellow.
What's the color of
a New York taxicab?
Mostly yellow.
I drove a cab
in Brooklyn.
I just pretend it's
rush hour in Flatbush,
and...
pppttt... in I go.
Ooh, you people,
you're all crazy.
Ah, just gives me
a chance
to do some
of my old jokes.
You said you'd had
a great day here today.
What was it
that you liked?
Oh, everything...
The car going so fast,
the animals running.
It seems...
a great way
to make a living.
Well, crazy, but...
Pockets, tell me
about things here.
Who are these men?
Where they come from?
Well... you know
about Brandy.
Mm-hmm.
And Kurt.
Let's see...
Oh, Luis.
He's Mexican.
He started out
as a bullfighter.
He told us
he was pretty good.
I'll tell you
about the Indian.
Oh, the Indian,
the man who wrote me,
Mr. Little Wolf.
Hah! Wait till
you meet him.
His folks didn't know
what they had
when they called
him Little Wolf.
The Indian and I
take care of Sean.
Take care of him?
How?
Well, Sean's Irish.
He gets mad.
If he takes his mad
out on us,
nobody gets hurt.
Pockets, why he
doesn't like women?
Why doesn't he like...
Dallas, I think it's
only fair to warn you
that you are laboring
under a gross
misapprehension...
Okay, Pockets.
But why doesn't
he like women?
Oh, he thinks
they're trouble.
Well, they are,
but who made him think so?
Well... that's
a long story.
He almost
got married once.
Well, that's possible.
He brought her
down here for a visit.
She hated the place.
She hated the animals.
She tried to get
Sean to leave.
One day, she got
on her broom
and just left town.
She was a fool.
You like it here,
don't you?
Yeah.
I like it.
I'm liable to
like it too much.
Yeah, Sean's
got a way of mak...
Ah, you sure got it
in a hurry, didn't you?
Pockets,
tell me about him.
Well... how does
he treat you?
You saw us all day.
Well,
that was working.
You were with him
a few minutes ago.
Was he nice
to you?
No. He wasn't.
Well, lady,
could be
that you're in.
- What do you mean?
- That's good.
If it were the other way,
you wouldn't have a prayer.
Pockets,
will you speak English?
If it's bad. It's good
if it's good, it's bad...
- I don't under...
- Okay. Look.
- If a man falls for a woman...
- Uh-huh.
And gets his
fingers burned,
so he won't
be singed again,
- what does he do?
- I don't know. Tell me.
If he doesn't
like you,
he doesn't care.
He can be nice.
If he does like you,
he doesn't want to
get in any deeper,
so he acts mean.
The more he likes you,
the meaner he acts.
- Doesn't that make sense?
- No.
Let's try
a different way.
If you were me,
what would you do?
If I were you,
Dallas...
You wouldn't want
me to answer that.
Pockets, make sense.
What shall I do?
- Now you're making sense.
- What?
You said,
"What shall I do?"
You're the one that
has to do it.
- He won't.
- That's simple.
- That I can understand.
- You know, I think you do.
Come on! We've settled everything.
Let's get a drink.
Dallas, don't
make him too mean.
- Why?
- He takes it out on me.
- [Laughter]
- What's so funny?
We were just
talking about
that big giraffe
you picked last year.
What a mess!
Stepped over Sean.
Landed
right on the hood.
It was over
16 feet.
And after all that
we had to let him go.
- Why?
- We couldn't get him to Mombasa.
We couldn't get him through
the railroad tunnel.
- Dallas, want a drink?
- No, thank you.
- [Plays Wrong Note]
- E-flat.
- What?
- E-flat!
[Continues Playing]
- [Plays Wrong Note]
- I told you. E-flat.
You'd better
be good.
[Playing Slowly]
At least I played
it with both hands.
(sing)(sing) [Boogie-Woogie Rhythm]
Radio: Arusha control
calling. Arusha control.
Arusha control
calling five-zero-five.
Do you read me?
Over.
This is five-zero-five.
We read you. Over.
I have a transmission
for you from Dr. Sanderson.
Go ahead,
Dr. Sanderson.
Sanderson:
Hello, five-zero-five.
Can you hear me?
Over.
Loud and clear,
Sandy. Go ahead.
You can have the Indian back
in 3 or 4 days.
I wish it were sooner.
My nurses are worn out
dodging him. Over.
That's good for them.
The exercise
will keep them thin.
Doc, if that Frenchman's
up and around,
I'd like to
talk to him. Over.
Frenchman? Didn't he come
to your place?
He sure did not.
Well, he left here
early this morning
with £15 he borrowed
from the Indian. Over.
Where'd the Indian
get £15?
Borrowed it from me.
Did the Frenchman say
what he was using
the money for?
No. Just borrowed it
and took off. Over.
Well, I guess
that's that.
Well, put the £15
on our bill, Doc.
Tell the Indian we're
not sure he's worth it.
I've already done
both those things.
Over and out.
Well, that's good news.
3 or 4 days, huh?
We could have used
the Frenchman.
Better to
work short-handed
than with the wrong
kind of man.
How do you know he
was the wrong kind?
He took £15 from the Indian
for saving his life.
What kind of man
does that?
Lafayette is coming.
What are you
talking about?
French blood bank
just turned in the gate.
- Hi.
- Hello.
The Indian said
he'd be back in a few days.
We talked to
the doctor.
Did he tell you
I was coming here?
Well, he said you borrowed
£15 from the Indian.
He said he hadn't
seen you since.
You thought I was
going to skip out, huh?
You could have.
I got something
to do first.
Do you always carry that
chip on your shoulder?
I needed the money to get
my rifle from the gunsmith.
Without a rifle, I couldn't
be much good to you.
Question is, are you worth
anything with it?
Why don't you try me
and see?
Kurt here's
a pretty good shot.
Would you like to
shoot against him?
I'd like that.
We'll go down
to the range.
I'd like to go.
Would an audience
bother you?
If it does,
he won't be much use.
It won't matter.
Hop in.
[Speaking Swahili]
Hey!
Where are you going?
Wait for me!
Dallas, come on!
Wait for Dallas!
Chari?
Chari, bombe!
All right.
Kurt, take the first
bottle on the right.
You... what is
your name?
Charles Maurey.
Charles Mau...
Charles Maurey.
Never mind.
Chips will do.
You take
the second one.
Then alternate.
You ready?
Tingisha chuka.
Go ahead.
[Glass Breaking]
[Glass Breaks]
There go my deposits.
Now shoot what's
left of them.
[Loading Rifles]
Rudi numa!
Well, that's pretty
fair shooting.
He's faster
than I am.
A little.
Reload, Chip.
We'll see how fast
you really are.
[Gunshot]
[Cocks Gun]
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
It looks like you're
going to work.
I still have
something to do.
May I have your gun,
please?
Sure.
Thank you.
Do you still
want me now?
You got the job.
Okay.
But you've got a strange way
of asking for it.
Kurt.
Radio:
Go ahead, Sean.
Our motor's running
a little hot.
We're going to
get some water.
Find a place
in the shade.
We'll be waiting
for you.
[Speaking Swahili]
[Speaking Swahili]
What on earth is this?
It's a well
for a water hole.
Belongs to
the Masai tribe.
Nobody knows
who built it
or how old it is...
A couple of thousand
years, maybe.
You see how they raise
the water to the cattle.
They'll work all day
getting that water up,
but when it comes
to repairing it,
they won't touch it...
Hire another tribe
to do the work.
They're cattlemen,
too proud to dig.
Jumbo!
Sisi dangamaji damaji.
Ah, chambe.
Can't you get any more speed
out of this thing?
Let's go, Pockets!
Oh, nuts!
Don't slow down.
Pass me the line.
Come on!
Hurry it up!
Someday, Pockets!
Someday, I'm going to
wring your neck.
Not today, Bwana!
Not today!
Just shut up
and drive!
We'd better get this one,
or he'll be mad.
The Lone Ranger
rides again!
Yahoo!
If he misses again,
stick your fingers
in your ears.
Slow down, easy!
Easy!
[Neighing]
Hold him!
Let me see something!
Hang on to him!
Open the door!
Kurt,
get out of there.
He's hard to hold.
Come on out.
Get the hell out,
will you?
Get up there!
Get him up!
Get him up!
Yeah.
I thought he was going to
take you clear to Arusha.
Have you got
another cage?
No, thank you.
Let's break out
the beer.
Chicky!
Chicky.
Chuey.
Chuey.
[Hyena Laughing]
Bring him over here.
Okay.
He knows the way.
Come on!
See how
he likes it!
Hello!
[Hyena Laughing]
Ha ha ha!
Want some?
Brandy!
[Grunting]
Hello!
Ha ha ha ha!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I really twisted
this thing yesterday.
Hmm? Yeah.
Well,
what's the matter?
You look
a little liverish.
Too much sun?
Sean,
how old is Brandy?
Oh,
she's around...
Let's see.
She was 17...
Have you had a close look
at her lately?
Holy smoke.
She's
all grown up.
I noticed that
the other night
when I was
zipping up her dress.
- When you what?
- Zipping her dress.
I stopped thinking
of her as a kid.
Oh, you did?
I did.
That Frenchman
isn't looking at her
like she was
a child, either.
Anybody can see that.
So that's why you're
green around the gills.
Spring comes
to the bushveldt,
and the young bucks
start butting their heads.
- So what?
- So...
I can't answer that,
but don't let it gum up
the work around here.
Oh, I won't,
but I'm not giving him
a free hand, either.
This is
going to be great!
The Indian's
knocked out,
we're stuck with
a woman photographer,
now you break out
in monkey bites,
- and we're a month behind already.
- So what?
So don't give him
a free hand.
Come on.
Come on.
[Horn Honks]
Hey,
it's the Indian!
Hey, welcome back,
Little Wolf!
We've missed you,
Indian.
Don't start
spoiling him.
Comment ca va?
Hi, Frenchy!
You've got good blood.
We're blood brothers
now, eh?
Not till I give you
some back.
Ow, it's like carrying
an elephant.
Indian, this is Signorina
Anna Maria D'Allesandro.
Molto piacere, Signorina.
Hey, where
you taking me?
To bed.
You're going to stay there.
Pockets stood up
in a chair.
You fellas clear out.
Let him sleep.
Thanks, boys.
Brought you
some water.
I've had that
for days.
Maybe this
will help.
Oh, that's
more like it.
What's happened
since I've been gone?
Frenchman's working out
pretty good.
He's quick,
pretty fair shot.
Better than I am?
Just as good.
Moves fast.
Go on.
Oh, we caught
a giraffe and a zebra.
Go on.
The Frenchman
and Kurt
got a thing going
about Brandy.
Go on.
What do you mean,
go on?
That Italian import
I saw out there,
who does she
belong to?
That Italian import
you saw out there
belongs
to the Basel Zoo.
That's
A.M. D'Allesandro.
Next time, check what
the initials mean.
How come
you let her stay?
I had no choice.
You haven't answered
my question.
Who does she
belong to?
Oh, Indian.
If you need anything
during the night, holler.
I'll leave my door open.
Sean...
what about rhino?
They say there's plenty
around Longido.
Don't do it.
Why?
Let them alone.
First it was
that nice Belgian kid,
then Brandy's father,
and then me.
This was pretty close.
Too close.
I'm beginning to think
we got the jinx
on us about rhino.
Oh...
that's just because
you got horned.
No. No, it isn't.
Sure I'm scared of them.
So is anybody with any sense.
You're right there.
So just for this season,
let them alone.
Well, we'll...
wait till we fill
the other orders...
Don't lose any sleep
over it for a while.
Good night.
Night.
[No Audible Dialogue]
I see you didn't
waste any time
giving the Frenchman
competition.
Competition?
She was just
kissing Uncle Kurt
for giving her
a present.
Has she ever thanked
Uncle Kurt that way before?
No. She hasn't.
Must have been
some present.
It was nothing,
one of those little
things women wear
with laces on it
and stuff...
What business
is it of yours?
Well, the Frenchman
was watching.
You got him
worried, anyway.
What's next?
I was thinking
of buffalo.
We got an order
for 3 of them,
a male and a pair
of young ones.
I hear they're moving
through Semanjaro.
Could be all right.
Semanjaro's good country
for a lot of stuff we need.
Ought to be good
because it's so dry.
Indian,
feel like traveling?
Sure, if I don't
have to walk.
Tell Arga to get
the stuff ready.
Enough for
4 or 5 days?
That ought to do it.
Oh, and, Dallas...
no red shirt like you
had on the first day.
Why?
Well, some people say
animals are color blind,
but I don't agree.
I had a bull
chase me once.
Really?
Yeah.
Sure it wasn't
the other way around?
[Laughs]
Your move.
Hi, Stan.
Sean, how are you?
Hello, Stan.
What happened?
She nearly killed
a native 3 nights ago.
You can see what
she started last night.
The family got out
just in time.
Can we help?
Have you
a radio set?
Sure.
Could you
tell headquarters
I'll stand by
until they arrive?
[Trumpeting]
Uh-oh!
A calf.
Did you know
she had a calf?
Not until
now.
Oh, poor baby.
[Speaking Italian]
Dallas! Watch out!
That thing
can hurt you.
He's not afraid.
You should be
afraid of him.
Stan,
it's up to you.
I don't envy you
your job.
I'll get your message
to headquarters.
Come, Dallas.
Let's get out
of here.
I won't watch.
Watch what?
It's the only way.
What are you
talking about?
That poor little fella
hasn't been weaned yet.
He's hungry right now.
That's why he isn't afraid.
A couple days without food,
he won't make it.
It's better
to get it over quick.
You're going to
shoot him?
I'm not.
Stan's the game ranger.
That's
my job.
Not a nice job.
Come on, Dallas.
- I won't come...
- Look, Dallas.
Unless you take him
with us.
We got plenty
of room.
How you going to
feed him?
We'll find a way, and
if he's hungry, he'll eat.
Don't shoot him,
or you'll have to shoot me.
Don't tempt me.
Sean, there are lots
of goats around here.
Goats?
Goat milk
is very nourishing.
You know how many goats
he would need?
What's a few goats?
How will
you feed him?
Posho would be good,
mealie flour with milk.
Like a baby formula.
What are you
grinning about?
Why haven't you
said anything, Indian?
I was
just thinking...
You're
going to lose.
Oh, I am, am I?
And you're
all for it?
That's it, Bwana.
Fine. You get goats,
and I'll make camp.
Then get those goats and
an elephant into the cars.
Then you figure how to get
the milk into the elephant.
I'll see you at camp,
if you ever make it.
Leti gari! Kwende!
Well,
what do we do?
First we take up
a collection
for the United
Elephant Fund.
That'll be $2.O0
apiece, folks.
I'll negotiate
for the goats
while you get them
all back in the cars.
That's it, that's it.
Everybody contributes.
See you later.
[Elephant Trumpets]
You missed
a lot of fun.
Couldn't get the elephant
into the car, eh?
That was easy. Trouble
was with the goats.
How'd you handle
the elephant?
Dallas climbed
into the car,
and he followed her.
Come, Timbo, come.
Take him out of here
while we get milk.
He's getting hungry.
Come!
Brandy, find pails and pans
to put milk in.
Okay, Kurt.
Well, boys.
Let's unload the goats.
Hey, boys.
Jumbo goshi.
[Trumpeting]
Kurt! Keep them back!
I'll get this one!
Timbo! Timbo! Come back!
Watch out!
[Trumpeting]
There goes
the dairy!
Now get him
over here.
Come on!
Get him
out of here!
[Laughing]
If you think
this is a mess,
wait till they
try to milk them.
It won't be easy.
Quiet, Timbo.
[Goats Bleating]
Pockets, what are you
trying to do?
Trying to
milk this goat.
That's the wrong kind
of a goat.
It's a ram.
Yah!
Come on.
I'll show you.
Turn around.
Oh, that's the way
you do it.
That's the way.
[Snorting]
Quiet, Timbo, quiet.
They're
getting milk for you.
[Trumpets]
[Bleating]
Now, what
are you doing?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Now, hold it quiet.
I can't...
Stand still,
baby.
Good.
[Trumpets]
Well, that doesn't
get us anywhere.
We are
wasting milk.
Goats only give
so much.
But he must eat!
I know, but that's
up to you people,
so start thinking.
If we take
a radiator hose
and shove it down...
[Trumpeting]
Shove the hose
right down his throat.
Then pour
the milk in?
You'll strangle him.
We could
cut a hole
in a bucket.
Yeah, but it's
still...
[Trumpeting]
Oh, shut up!
He'd still
have to swallow.
Now he just chokes.
I seem to remember
you started all this.
Me?
You're a little confused.
I just went along.
Keep going along
and think of something.
If he'd just shut up,
I may be able to con...
Hey,
he's not yelling.
That's the way,
Timbo. Easy.
Yes.
Oh, that's good!
Wonderful!
Yes, Timbo.
Here.
Oh, yes.
Now, stop!
Oh,
that's good.
It's easy.
I just thought
how you feed a baby.
They never begin
by pouring stuff
into them
out of a bucket.
Here. Here, Timbo.
Oh, that's nice.
Ha ha!
That's good.
We ought to try Longido.
7 Sisters
is on the way.
We might
find them there.
Hi, Brandy.
Hi.
Let's see which one
has to work.
Go ahead, Chips.
Take a straw.
But I don't
understand.
What is this for?
I'm going to the river
to take a bath.
I cannot carry a gun
and take a bath, too.
Whoever gets the short
straw comes with me.
Not with
this leg, Brandy.
Okay.
We've been doing this
since she's been this high.
I have the short straw,
Brandy.
Oh, let's go.
Sean...
Yeah?
This afternoon,
when we drew straws,
you didn't have
a short straw.
I know it.
Why did you say
you did?
Didn't you tell me
the other day
you'd discovered
Brandy was grown up?
Yeah.
Well, that Frenchman
doesn't look at her
like she
was a schoolgirl,
and I'm not so sure
about Pockets.
I figured I'd better
be the one.
I still think of her
as a kid.
All right, Papa.
Can I give you
a little warning?
Mm-hmm.
It isn't a fatherly gleam
in your eye
when you
look at Dallas.
Oh, stop it!
Don't act innocent
with me.
Do you want me
to answer this letter
from the San Diego Zoo?
Huh?
I'll do it.
Do what?
Answer the letter
from the San Diego Zoo.
Oh, sure.
I've run out
of cigarettes.
I'll get some
in my tent.
Hey, Pockets!
Hi! I thought
you'd turned in.
- You got a minute?
- Sure.
Well, uh...
did Sean have
anything more to say
about
the baby elephant?
Oh, he didn't
want to see it shot
any more
than you did.
Where is it?
It's a he, Pockets.
I've been mixed up
before.
He's tied up over there
under the trees. He's asleep.
Well, don't miss
his 2:00 feeding.
He's liable
to start squalling.
Sean
wouldn't like that.
You can't walk the floor
with him, either.
By the way, uh...
how you doing
with the big bwana?
You heard him today.
He would like to
shoot me, he said.
I thought it was
a good sign.
Good sign?
If he really gets
to like me, I'm in danger.
Remember
what I told you.
He won't
start anything.
You're going to
have to do it.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Well...
now is as good a time
as any.
See you
in the morning.
Hi, Kurt.
Night, Dallas.
Watch it, Papa.
- Hi, Sean.
- Hello, Dallas.
I wanted to
thank you
for letting me
keep the elephant.
Well, why thank me?
There are a lot of
other people on your side.
Well, then, I'm sorry
there was so much trouble
about the goats and...
Oh, that
couldn't be helped.
Anyway, Pockets
trying to milk that ram
made that worthwhile.
- Dallas, will you have a drink?
- No, thank you.
This is the first time
you've been nice to me.
I was almost afraid
to come here.
Well,
why did you come?
I wanted to ask you
a question.
Well, go ahead.
Sean...
how do you
like to kiss?
How do I
like to kiss?
That's
what I said.
What are you
talking about?
How do you like it?
Do you like it
slow or quick?
Do you like to
kiss the girl
or have her
kiss you?
Well,
that's silly!
You say
it's silly?
Have you never
been kissed before?
Of course
I've been kissed.
Why do you say
it's silly?
It's silly to stand here
and talk about it.
Of course!
Let's do it.
I'll show you.
You like
like this?
There's
a lot of peop...
Or you like slow,
like this?
Oh, I think
you like slow better.
You want to try again
to make sure?
I've taken about all
I'm going to take.
What are you
going to do?
Sean, I was...
I beg your pardon.
We should be in a railroad
station for more company.
Gee, I'm sorry.
I broke something up,
didn't I?
You managed.
What do you want?
Saidi says they
saw leopard tracks
down by the river.
Big?
According to Saidi,
it's nearly an elephant.
We need
a big one.
Well, I suppose we
better go talk to him.
Gee, I'm sorry,
Dallas.
It's all right.
I mean...
Dallas, look.
Just out of curiosity,
how'd you get him
started?
I just asked him
how he liked to kiss.
You just asked him...
How he likes to kiss.
And you was just
finding out when l...
Mm-hmm.
If I ever get a problem,
may I come to you?
- Pockets!
- Yes, Bwana.
Bring him in a little!
Watch it, Pockets!
Bring us
another head rope.
All right.
[Bellowing]
[Smash]
Look out!
He's loose!
All right, Pockets,
let's go!
Don't lose him!
[Banging]
Our insurance rate
just went up.
Drop that thing
off of there!
Don't give him time
to get any rest.
[Smash]
Lay it on.
Over here.
[Smash]
Sean:
Take the door, Kurt.
Nagashi damma.
All right,
turn him loose!
Take it off!
[Bellowing]
Sean: He's caught.
Keep the rope tight.
Kurt: Push him
from behind, Luis.
All set.
[Speaking Swahili]
It's the easiest one
we ever got.
[Engine Sputters, Dies]
Well, we are stuck.
I'll take
the cable over.
Okay.
Look out, Kurt!
[Gunshot]
Thank you.
All right, Pockets,
take her away.
You know,
this afternoon...
I don't like crocodiles,
especially when
I'm in the water.
Anyway, thanks again.
[Speaking French]
[Speaking German]
I'm going to
need help, boys.
The baby leopard
is not eating good.
I'll get
some milk and eggs.
Our girl looks
pretty good tonight, huh?
I'll flip you to see
who goes with her.
Let's go together.
I don't trust you.
All right, then.
Give me
my shilling back.
Hey, Kurt, come here
a minute, will you?
Somebody left
the ostrich pen open.
Here we go again.
Ongalea unbuni.
[Shouting In Swahili]
Why didn't you catch him?
I'd better let
the boys do it.
Comata!
Comata!
Hey, let
the females go!
Keep the male!
The girls will come back
to the old man anyway.
Hold still, baby.
There it is.
Pockets, you got
a pair of pliers?
- I think so.
- He's got a thorn.
Easy, now. Easy.
It'll be
better now.
Come, babies.
Sean, look.
What's all this?
I was going to bring
Timbo to the bath,
and I found this one.
- Aren't they nice together?
- No.
- But they can play together.
- It takes 20 goats...
- Sean, don't speak.
- To feed one elephant,
- and it takes...
- Listen first, don't speak.
- Why shouldn't I?
- So you don't make yourself a fool.
- Now I'm a fool?
- No, not yet.
Just if you don't listen,
you're a fool.
- Well, I'm listening.
- I hired an African boy.
He will buy more goats.
He will milk the goats...
and take care of Timbo
and his friend.
You won't have
any trouble.
Aren't you glad
you're not a fool?
- Dallas...
- Yes, Sean?
- Oh, hell!
- [Chuckles]
Come on, baby.
Let's go and have a bath.
Well, you certainly won
that one, Bwana.
Someday, Pockets.
Someday.
Here.
It's good.
No. Look. Come.
Come, baby. Come.
Oh!
Come, baby.
- Take a look, Bwana.
- What?
It's worth your while.
Come, baby.
Oh!
Oh, that's good.
Good. Yeah.
That's good.
Nice.
Funny how good
she is with animals.
She could even
do it to me.
You could use it.
Okay. That's enough.
Come, baby.
(sing)(music)(music) [Jazz]
- Hi, Pockets.
- Oh, hi, Dallas.
- What are you doing by yourself?
- I don't know.
You said if you
ever had any problem,
you would come to me.
You got one now?
- Have you got one now?
- A problem? What about?
Brandy. You're in love
with her, aren't you?
Are you nuts?
Me in love with Brandy?
That's the most...
Hey, how did you know?
The way you look at her.
A woman can tell.
Then why didn't
she ever notice it?
Probably she has.
How do you know?
She never did
anything about it.
As you told me,
you've got to do it.
Well, that's fine,
but what do I do?
I can't ask her
how she likes to kiss.
That's your stuff.
What do I do?
- Did you ever dance with her?
- I don't remember.
- Do you know how to dance?
- Sure.
- As well as they can?
- Easy.
Come on.
We'll show them.
Why, Pockets,
I didn't know
you could dance
like that.
Go ahead, Pockets.
Show her.
[Men Singing
In Swahili]
- [Knock On Door]
- Hey, Dallas.
- Yes.
- [Speaking Italian]
Vengo.
You got visitors from
the Warusha village.
Can't you hear them?
I was wondering what
the singing was about.
It's for you and the elephants.
They've made a song for you.
Really? How nice.
I'll come in a moment.
[Swahili]
What are they
going to do?
It's just
a Warusha ceremony.
Hi, Sean.
Hey!
What's the matter?
[Speaking Italian]
Sean,
please help me!
Sean!
We better go along
and see that they don't
get too enthusiastic.
[Shouting In Swahili]
[Chanting]
I don't think it's funny.
They want to shave my hair!
They want to take
my clothes off.
- There was a man in there!
- He doesn't speak English.
You are a member
of the Warusha tribe.
They've named you
"Mother of Elephants,"
Mama Timbo!
You're supposed to
dance with them.
Ah ha ha!
Ah! Roast beef.
My favorite.
Everything's
your favorite.
Arga,
have you red wine?
Some beer
for me, please.
Where's Mama Timbo?
She will eat
in her room.
She's not coming
to dinner.
She was in
the tub hours
scrubbing
the paint off.
That stuff
works like dye.
She says she has
no skin left.
We were
a bit rough on her.
- Do Italians like red wine?
- Any kind.
Get yourself
another bottle.
- Arga, another wine.
- Ndio.
- Who is it?
- Sean. Are you decent?
No, no, no.
Don't come in!
Well, cover up.
I'm coming.
Hello, Sonya!
Gee, she's taken quite...
- Oh, brother!
- Oh, Sean. You make me mad.
When I look nice,
you don't come near me!
Now with this stuff
on my face...
- You look all right.
- Oh, phooey!
All right.
You look terrible.
Then why don't
you go away?
How do you feel?
I hurt. I almost took
my skin off scrubbing.
Gave you
a good color.
How can you tell
with this stuff on?
- I brought you a drink.
- Why?
Well, I don't know,
the way you're acting,
but you were
great today.
It meant a lot
to that Warusha tribe.
They say Mama Timbo is
rifiki, which means friend.
Thank you.
They also say
you're mbalimibali.
If that means "covered with
cold cream," they are right.
It means you're different
than other women.
- Yes. Nice and greasy.
- Quit squawking.
- Well, look at me!
- I am.
Come here.
You are
a little slippery.
Here. Wipe it off,
and we'll try again.
- Ouch!
- I'm sorry.
Women and their
contraptions.
Now you stop
squawking.
- Come and get it!
- [Hisses]
[Gasps]
I brought you
your dinner.
- Now, S... Now, Sean.
- [Laughing]
Sean, I didn't mean
to do it, Sean.
[Laughing]
Work them out
onto the flats.
Radio: Move them
onto the flats.
Make sure they know
that's where you want them.
Tell me when
you've picked one.
I want one
with blue eyes.
Ha ha ha!
Over to the right,
Pockets!
That bunch over
to the right!
Where he goes,
we go!
[Bang]
Hang on!
Where are you hurt?
Easy, easy.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Your shoulder?
Ohh!
Just a dislocated
shoulder.
Just dislocated, huh?
I think she's right.
Hold still,
and I'll fix it.
Hah!
Better?
Is it all right?
You all right?
Let me have some
of this water.
Okay, Chips?
Okay?
My leg's hurt.
Pull him
out of there.
Let's stand him up.
Uhh!
Put your weight
on your leg. Try.
That's fine. Try.
It's not broken.
It's all right.
Get him cleaned up.
Come.
Take a look
at this car.
[Speaking Swahili]
Well...
pretty lucky.
We can tow this in
behind the green truck.
We sure were lucky
this afternoon.
When that car
went over...
- Well, you never know.
- Know what?
- Women... or what they'll do.
- What?
What are you
talking about?
Brandy
when the jeep flipped.
I'd have sworn
she was in love
- with one of those 2 Romeos.
- Well, isn't she?
- She didn't act like it.
- I always thought...
She didn't act like
she was in love with them.
Not to my way
of thinking.
- Nor to mine, either.
- Hmm.
Hmm!
Hmm.
- Rough trip?
- We never missed a bump.
What's going on?
What happened?
- They flipped the herding car.
- Wrecked the car?
- It'll be all right.
- They will be all right.
- Need any help?
- We'll get cleaned up first.
- I can use a drink.
- Let's get unloaded.
- Pockets?
- Yeah?
- Help us with the wildebeest.
- Aw, come on.
You know animals
don't like me!
You can get
in their way.
You said I wasn't going to fuss
with the animals!
All right, Sean.
He's hooked.
Here, Pockets.
Take this line...
What are you
doing up there?
If he were up here,
I'd be down there.
Take this line.
Pull him out when
we open this door.
Keep the slack out of it
so he won't get hurt.
[Grunting]
[Grunting]
Ready, Pockets?
Watch out!
Don't fall in
with those buffalo!
Thanks for
the advice, Sean.
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
Pockets, darling!
Are you all right?
Speak to me,
please, darling!
Poor, sweet, baby.
Oh, Pockets.
Do something, Sean!
Do something!
What's the matter
with him?
He's hurt.
He doesn't hear me.
Pockets, darling.
Please speak to me.
- Hello, Brandy.
- Are you all right?
I think so.
Ohh.
No. You are not
all right.
Just let me rest
here a minute.
We have to
get him into the house.
I think you're right!
Lift him carefully.
You will be
all right.
It's nothing. Ooh!
What are you
trying to do?
I don't know,
but it's working.
Want me to give you
a hot bath?
Oh, no, Brandy.
A hot bath?
You just get
his bed ready.
Right away.
- Now?
- Now.
Oww!
Thanks for coming in
to patch us up.
You look like
you'll make it.
How's the leg,
Chips?
A drink
would help it.
There's no ice.
Arga!
You're wasting
your breath.
- There isn't any.
- What happened?
They'll have to know
sooner or later.
Come on,
make sense.
Take a look
in Brandy's room.
What's
all the ice...
Go ahead. Take a look,
both of you.
All right.
We'll humor you.
I think
you are mean.
They'll live
through it.
How do you
feel now, darling?
Oh, wonderful,
Brandy.
I was so frightened when
you fell off that fence.
He fell off a fence.
You nearly
took a leg off.
I got a dislocated
shoulder.
- And he gets the ice.
- Yeah.
Come on. I'll buy you
a nice, warm drink.
How did you
get outside?
You bad boy!
Come back in.
Come on.
Oh!
Oh, no!
Whew! 3!
What would Sean say?
Oh, I can't tell him.
Tell him what?
- This one.
- What's so unusu...
No! How did
this happen?
I don't know.
It happened when I was
asleep. What do we do?
- How should I know?
- Gosh, we got another one.
We're running
an elephant nursery.
- Mother.
- That means that he can stay.
Well, you won
another one.
Come on, baby,
let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Come, baby.
Come. Come.
Come, baby. Come.
Come here.
Don't be afraid.
You fellas have any idea
what Pockets is doing
in the workshop?
He won't let anybody in.
He says you promised him
not to interfere.
Another one
of his inventions.
Some Rube Goldberg
for catching monkeys.
Do you know what he's
been buying to catch monkeys?
- No.
- Listen to this.
"840 feet 3/8 nylon rope.
260 feet 1/8 airplane cable.
"80 feet 1/2
O.D. Aluminum tubing.
- 1,200 square yards nylon fishnet."
- Fishnet?
Must be figuring on running
them into the river
and catching
them there.
You just listen to this.
"100 pounds black powder.
20 war-surplus rockets."
- What?
- For throwing from ship to ship.
"4 firing switches
to be used in missiles
for second-stage boost."
- Holy smoke!
- Is he trying to catch monkeys
or launch them?
We'd better have a talk
with this gentleman.
Sean, I'd put out
that cigarette.
[Buzzing]
Hatari!
Hatari! Hatari!
What the... Come on!
Get that hose!
Turn on the water.
Don't put
the water on it!
You'll spoil
everything in there!
The place
is on fire!
It's just the powder.
It'll clear away.
I thought you were rigging
something to catch monkeys.
I am. See? The smoke
is clearing.
What are you doing?
You said you'd
leave me alone.
I didn't expect
Cape Canaveral!
This place
is restricted.
You promised.
You did promise,
didn't you?
Yes, I promised.
You going to
break your promise?
Did you set that off,
or did it go off
by itself?
Did I?
What happened was...
Well, you see...
What?
Well, I, l...
what...
I didn't feel that...
You promised!
Get the roof fixed.
Rudi hapa!
Hi, sweetie.
What'll
you have?
Beer, if it's cold.
How's that
invention coming?
It's coming along fine.
How will you catch
monkeys with a rocket?
He's going to scare them
half to death.
When they faint,
we carry them away.
- Okay. Okay.
- How will you catch them?
I'm not going to
catch the monkeys.
I'll get 500 monkeys
under that net
for you to catch.
Some vervet monkeys
have teeth an inch long.
- I've seen them bigger than that.
- An inch and a half.
If I were you, I'd
figure out some armor
to keep those monkeys
from sinking their teeth
into my anatomy.
I'll be ready
in a few days.
If you don't think
the invention will work,
forget that monkeys have
got teeth this long.
- Good night, Pockets.
- Good night, Brandy.
Good night, folks.
Rest well.
You don't suppose
by any chance...
Problem is, you can't
depend on Pockets.
It might work.
What a thing
to say.
I'm not getting
my ears bit off.
We'd better
get busy.
Get some armor.
Hi.
Holy muckya!
You look like
a gasoline pump.
Can you bend down
in that thing?
Sure.
Move around?
The man from Mars.
Take me
to your leader.
Give me a hand
with this, Dallas.
You want
your door closed?
No. I can't breathe.
[Shouting
In Swahili]
[Whooping]
Go on back!
Rudi numa!
Rudi numa!
Rudi numa!
There's more coming
over here! Back!
Up, up, up,
you little devils!
All we need is
about 200 more.
Mengi, ngeni, ngeni!
Leti. Mengi, ngeni, ngeni!
[Jazz Music
[Playing]
Rudi kashi assenti.
[Turns
Record Player Off]
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention
for a minute, please?
3 miles down the road
is a tree.
There's lots of monkeys
in that tree.
At 6:30 tomorrow morning,
I'll be ready to throw
a net over those monkeys.
The rest, my friends,
up to you.
So you've got them
up that tree.
How did you get
them up there?
The Warushas
were very helpful.
I gave them 2 cartons
of your cigarettes.
Well, that was
very generous of you.
I hope they
pleased them.
They would have liked
filter tips...
What makes you think those monkeys
will be in the tree tomorrow?
I tied Rover and Cyclone
under the tree.
They were barking nicely
when I left.
Have you got your armor ready,
King Arthur?
Sir Galahad?
Black Knight? Red Knight?
And good night.
Sleep tight.
Oh, thank you.
You, too.
You'll need it.
Waka chuinee!
Poli, poli.
Okay.
Misuri, misuri.
Rockets
for Pockets.
Everybody
ready?
Do you think
this will work?
I've been working
very hard. I'm nervous.
I can
understand that.
I'm going to shoot
that net over the tree.
There are 5oo monkeys
in the tree.
You worry about
catching the monkeys.
You worry about the monkeys.
I'll be right here watching.
- The tree's over there.
- Sure.
The rocket's pointing
away from the tree. Why?
That's right.
I read books.
Vectors, trajectors,
centrifugal forces.
You know what
those things are?
- No.
- Then you wouldn't understand why
- the rocket's pointed that way.
- But do you know?
I would suggest you
get behind that tree.
I'm about
to light this thing.
And I'm about
to get behind a tree.
When the net
is over the tree,
get in there fast
before those monkeys get away.
Ondohka ubesi kuli!
It worked.
Pockets, it worked!
It did?
All right, Luis.
Get the cage truck.
Let's go get them!
It worked.
Oh, it worked.
It worked.
Timber!
Come on!
Go get the monkeys!
Come on! In! In!
We're going great,
Sean. Bring another box!
We?
That's good, good!
Get another cage!
Okay, put them in.
That's good.
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Okay. Put them in.
That's good.
All right.
Uh-oh!
Here comes Pockets.
You'll have to tell him
again about the rocket.
Well,
he earned it.
- Sean?
- Yes, Pockets?
Sean, the rocket
was all right, wasn't it?
As I told you,
nobody can ever say your
inventions don't work.
Thank you, Sean.
I didn't see it.
I was behind a tree.
I had my hands
cupped over my eyes.
- Yeah, I know.
- Tell me about it, Sean.
He told you twice.
Tell me again, Sean.
The rocket went up,
just like you said,
went over that tree,
and took the net
with it... plumb center...
- Just like you said it would.
- Just like I said it would.
Did the monkeys
get away, Sean?
We got close to
5oo of them caged.
$6,000 worth.
Tell me about the smoke.
Kurt could see that
better than I.
What?
Go ahead.
Tell him.
Tell me.
Well... there it was,
the great silver rocket...
It was red and blue.
The great red and blue
silver rocket
leaving
a white trail...
A white trail?
Against the blue sky.
You never told it
like that.
It must have been
beautiful.
Sean, tell me again
about the rocket.
Well, it went
just like you said... gin.
Gin.
It's too bad
you didn't see it.
Well, tell me!
Pockets, get me
a drink, will you?
Left a white trail?
A white trail
against the blue sky.
Where's she going?
She said the elephants
were hot.
She's taking them
for a swim.
Come, baby.
Jumbo.
Well, go get a gun
and follow her...
I can't go
fast enough, Bwana.
Come, baby. Come.
Oh, that's good.
Okay, baby, let's go.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on, baby.
Come on.
[Trumpets]
Hi.
What'd I say about
leaving the compound
without somebody
carrying a gun?
Without somebody
carrying a gun?
It wouldn't do me
any good to carry a gun.
I can't shoot. Besides,
it's a very short way.
It's far enough to
get you into trouble.
That swimming pool
is a water hole.
Only one around here.
Everything has to come
in there to drink.
- I won't bother them.
- They might bother...
[Elephants Trumpeting]
- What's that?
- Keep quiet.
[Elephant Trumpeting]
Well, that does it.
Some of Timbo's
grandfathers are around.
Here.
Now, keep walking.
[Elephants Trumpeting]
Keep moving.
Get behind that tree
and stay there.
[Bellowing]
[Bellows]
[Gunshot]
You can come out now.
Well, we're lucky.
I think they've gone.
I was afraid you were
going to have to shoot him.
Him? That was a cow.
She was trying to tell us
to leave her baby alone.
She has one.
You have three.
She figured
you had enough.
So do I. Come on.
Let's go, baby.
Come.
Just about wound up.
Yup. I only see
one order left to fill.
That's right, Indian.
Your little pets... the rhino.
You're going to
try them, then?
You still believe in
that jinx?
I still can't walk good.
But I won't waste
any more breath.
- Do one thing to humor me.
- What's that?
Let Kurt use the power
wagon for herding.
- It's slower.
- It's fast enough.
It's higher. Rhino
can't climb into it.
- I'll buy that.
- Is it working good?
I'm the one who
has to drive it.
All right, we'll use
2 ropes tomorrow.
Chips, you take a pole
with Kurt.
We'll leave early,
so we'd better turn in.
We don't want any hangovers
in the morning, Pockets.
All right, good night.
Pockets, tell Sean he's looking
the wrong way.
You've got a visitor
right behind you.
Why don't you put
the tailgate down
and let him climb in?
We'll take this one.
Kurt, we'll take
this one.
Will do.
This is a big one.
Don't be in a hurry.
I'll be very
careful, Bwana.
You're supposed
to chase him!
Tell him that!
Move in a little,
Pockets.
Moving in.
Watch that line,
Saidi!
[Grrr]
Take a dolly around
that roller bar!
Hang on!
Hang on to him!
Hang on
to the son of a...
Tighten him up.
All right, Luis,
he's all yours.
Lay that loop
over his head!
Kurt, pull her forward
a little.
Say when.
When!
Casa camba!
Stand still there.
Keep those ropes taut!
I'm going to try
and move him.
[Grrr]
Casa camba!
Loosen this up
a little.
[Grrr]
Casa camba.
Loosen this up
a little.
Fair day's work.
Nice going, big bwana.
Well, that's the end
of your jinx.
Sure looks that way.
Like to kick him
in the backsides?
Don't get tangled
in those ropes!
Hang on to him!
Look out!
He's loose!
Well,
let's start over.
Let's get going
again.
All right. Move in
a little closer.
Is that close enough?
Let's give it a try,
Pockets. He's tired.
Are we talking about
the same animal?
Bring him in
a little!
Watch it, Pockets.
Watch it, Pockets!
He's going to quit on you.
Get another rope
around his head!
We're all right.
Watch that line
on the catching car.
Take the rope.
Unload in a hurry
and grab those lines!
Tamata camba!
Now, pull! Pull!
Yank on it!
Look out, Luis!
All right,
tip him over!
Tamata camba.
Tamata camba!
[Grrr]
They got him now.
Well, there you are,
Indian.
He won't get away.
Easy, Sean, easy.
This breaks
the jinx.
I'll feel a lot better
when he's delivered.
Bring in that crate!
He's
a real nice one.
Coming in.
You got cleaned up
in a hurry.
It feels good
to be finished.
We're not finished
till we get
those animals
to Mombasa aboard ship.
That won't take long.
Marja Singh said
he would go with them.
He's a good man.
What will you do
till next season?
I had a letter
from Bandini.
He wants me to drive
his new car.
I thought you
quit that.
One more time
won't hurt.
I hope you don't
break your neck.
The Frenchman is
coming with me.
We both know a girl
in Paris.
One girl
for the two of you?
We go halves.
It's a good excuse
for another fight.
What's Dallas
going to do?
I don't know.
You want an opinion
from me?
Looks like
I'm going to get it
whether I want it
or not.
You're like the fella
who got bit by a leopard,
and now he sees
spots on everything.
There's something
about this girl.
I like her.
I really like her.
It's gone that far?
I don't know her,
and she doesn't know me!
I've been busy.
I haven't had time.
Only 3 months,
the whole hunting season.
- Are you pushing me?
- Take your time. She'll be waiting.
- Look, Kurt, this is serious.
- I know it.
Ask her to come back
next year.
She isn't very attractive.
She won't meet anybody like you.
More cracks like that,
you won't need
a racing car
to break your neck.
- Let's go to town.
- I don't think you ought to go.
- Why?
- You shouldn't be exposed to her.
You might say something
you'll regret.
- Am I as bad as that?
- You ought to know.
- Who is it?
- Pockets.
Come on in.
Say, Dallas...
Hi, Pockets.
Hey, we're going
into town...
to celebrate.
- You ready?
- I don't think I'll go.
- I got some work to do.
- Oh, come on.
Dallas,
this is Pockets.
What's the matter?
Isn't it going too good?
No, it's not going
too good.
Ah, probably my fault.
I messed it up
a couple of times.
That didn't mean anything.
You didn't mess it up.
I didn't do it.
She did it.
Come again?
That girl
you told me about,
the one you said made
him burn his fingers.
Pockets,
when he looks at me,
when he touches me,
he likes what he sees
just for...
Then she's there, and
I'm not there anymore.
- Well, couldn't you sort of...
- No, I couldn't!
It's all over.
I don't even know
if I want him anymore.
I was all right
until you came in.
I just couldn't
stand him looking at me
and wondering if I was
going to be like her.
I'd rather not have him.
It just wouldn't...
Please, Pockets,
go away.
Dallas, if there's anything
I can do to... help.
Please go away.
Go with the others.
All aboard,
all aboard.
Bus now leaving
for 42nd street
and Arusha Square.
Everybody here?
Where's Dallas?
In her room.
She's not coming.
Says she has
work to do.
Well...
Well, what?
I'll see if I can
change her mind.
I'll see you
in town.
Holy smoke!
What do you got
in the third?
Smells good,
too.
This is business.
- Has it got a sister?
- Two sisters?
Dallas? Sean.
Come in.
What's going on here?
Please turn the light
off, Sean.
Sure.
What's the matter,
Dallas?
Why aren't you
going with us?
I just don't
feel like it.
- You've been crying!
- What if I have?
Can't somebody cry
if they want to?
What are you
crying about?
Nothing.
It must be something.
Tell me.
It's because...
I got a scratch.
A what?
A scratch! Going
through the bush today!
Oh, a scratch.
It hurts,
that's all.
What are you doing?
Hold still.
No wonder it hurts.
Thorn is still in you.
There.
There's some iodine
around here.
Never mind.
Just let it go.
It would be better
with something on it.
You need iodine
worse than I do.
I need iodine?
For your fingers.
There's nothing wrong
with my fingers.
I get all mixed up.
Do you use iodine
on a burn?
A burn? Make sense.
What do you do when
you burn your fingers?
You put butter on them.
Someday you'll find
somebody with butter.
I don't get it.
Fingers, burn, butter...
What are you talking about?
Why don't you go away?
You always come in
when I don't want you!
Don't touch me!
Just go away!
Get out of here
before...
OK!
[Crying]
[Door Slams]
Now, what the hell
did I say?
[Elephants Trumpeting]
First morning
we can sleep,
those elephants!
What a racket!
Hasn't Mama Timbo
fed them this morning?
- Mama Timbo has gone.
- What?
That's why
they are yelling.
What do you mean, gone?
- She left a little while ago.
- What do you mean, left?
Maybe he can
understand you, Pockets.
She has packed her bags
and departed.
- She can't do that.
- Found this letter under my door.
Under my door.
I'll tell you what she says.
Well, read it.
"Dearest Pockets..."
that's me.
"I never could
stand good-byes,
so I'm having Saidi
drive me into town."
You notice she doesn't
write with an accent.
"Tell everybody I can't
find words to thank them,
"that I'll never
forget them,
that I love them.
Dallas."
- You believe now that she is gone?
- Got to stop her.
You mean you didn't
want her to go?
Of course I didn't
want her to go.
- You asked her to stay?
- I was going to, but...
- But what?
- She wouldn't give me a chance.
- She ran me out.
- She's a smart girl.
- What will you do?
- I'm gonna find her.
Arusha's not a little town, if
Dallas doesn't want to be found.
- Maybe Timbo could find her.
- Get him on the scent.
- He's got a long nose.
- Hurry it up!
- What's all this stuff?
- She left that behind.
Make a good bandage
for your fingers.
Oh, I've got a lot of friends.
Call the airport.
Tell them not to
let her on a plane.
Shall I tell
them why?
- Tell them she stole... money.
- What?
Have the police watch
the road to Nairobi.
She robbed
the Bank of England.
Chips and I will check
the taxi station.
I'll go. I can go
places they can't.
Hurry it up,
Luis!
Why did you
bring all three?
We can only use Timbo.
Here! Come here!
Heya!
Get in there!
Get in! Get in!
Get in!
Now, hold it.
[Grunting]
Aw, come on, Timbo!
What does she do
to make him move?
Come on! Get in!
Come on, Timbo!
- Come on! Timbo!
- This might work.
What is that?
Look, Timbo,
look.
This is Mama.
Yes! Mama!
Bwana, you remember Mama,
don't you?
Come on! Come on!
Take a smell.
Yes. It's Mama.
It's going to work!
A wise child that
knows its own mother.
Get out.
There's no room for you.
Hello, airport?
If a girl about 5'6"
with red hair shows up,
don't let her
on a plane.
She robbed
the Bank of England.
Wait a minute.
Stop. Sean! Sean!
Any luck?
Not at
the railroad station.
She's been to
the ticket office.
What did she get?
Airline ticket.
But she wasn't at the airport.
She must be in town.
- But where?
- I don't know.
- Timbo doing any good?
- Not a thing.
Do those clothes
belong to Dallas?
Sure.
He's probably
smelling them.
Give them to us.
Sean! Sean!
Slow up!
I think
he smells something.
He does smell
something.
Come on, Timbo.
Come on, baby.
There he goes.
He's going
into Singh's.
Come on!
[Trumpets]
Oh, no!
Go away!
[Whistle Blowing]
[Whistle Blowing]
Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh, you shouldn't
have done it!
It's not...
It's not fair.
[Crying]
I didn't want you
to do this.
Why did you...
Look, Dallas.
What did you
have to do that for?
Why didn't you just
let me go?
Go away!
It's your fault!
[Blows Nose]
(sing)(music)(music) [Harmonica]
Good night, Sean!
Good night!
Before you go
any further,
I think I should tell you
that you're not alone.
What's your name?
They call me Dallas.
What are you doing
in my bed?
Sean, I want to
talk to you.
You know that girl Dallas
we were looking for?
Well, if we want to...
Oh, Sean.
You know that girl we were
looking for this afternoon?
- She's in your bed.
- Pockets, out.
- What's she doing in your bed?
- Just get out.
- We got married this afternoon!
- [Elephants Trumpeting]
- Oh, no!
- [Trumpeting]
Go away!
Go away, now!
Timbo, go away!
Go away!
Timbo!
Timbo! Go away!
Timbo!
[Screams]
- Ohh...
- Go away!
