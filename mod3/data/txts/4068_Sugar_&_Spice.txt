<i>It's age old wisdom.</i>

What did you just say?
"Video Rentals"

<i>What?</i>
Say that again!
You suck.
I'll kill myself.
Don't!
You almost killed me!
Wait, stop.
New position.
This is for you.
A souvenir? Thanks.
Welcome.
What're they up to?
Wrestling?
Coming through!
Where were you?
I'm ready!
What's your problem?
Get off me!
Hey, Shiro.
Ever heard of "Dil to Pagal Hai"?
What's that?
Indian movie.
Madhuri Dixit dances
in the pouring rain.
Like this.
She's a lot like her.
Who is?
Yoko.
Stop it!
I'm okay now, I swear.
Okay about what?
<i>She's voluptuous.</i>
<i>Like a mature woman.</i>
I've decided on Nagoya University.
I'm leaving Tokyo after grad.
You're kidding!
It's too painful.
See ya.
<i>I had yet to experience love.</i>
<i>I don't know if this is the
right definition for it but...</i>
<i>if being in love means having
uncontainable feelings for another...</i>
<i>then I hadn't known it.</i>
Geez, that was close.
"Women's Dormitory"
Look out!
<i>At that moment...</i>
<i>I was still seventeen.</i>
SUGAR & SPICE
What Little Girls Are Made of
Hi, Shiro.
What's up?
Where's Naoki?
Bathroom... Does he know
you're coming?
Animals.
Shiro, look!
I'm getting a queen size bed.
Sex in any direction!
Living together?
Yeah but Yoko doesn't know it yet.
Don't tell her.
It's a surprise.
<i>She'll be thrilled.</i>
<i>But we can't afford this place
on her salary.</i>
<i>So I'm going to work.</i>
What about college?
Still going.
Work and study?
Of course!
I'd do anything for her.
I'm telling you, man...
life is fucking great!
Yoko!
I get your point, Naoki, okay?
May I help you?
Come again!
Good luck at work!
<i>After high school graduation...</i>
<i>I decided...</i>
<i>not to go to college.</i>
<i>Not yet.</i>
<i>I got a job at a gasoline stand.</i>
Good morning!
Check out back.
Finished?
Premium fill up!
<i>Of course, my parents were opposed.</i>
<i>Not yet?</i>
Why put off college
to work at a gas stand?
<i>I had no idea.</i>
<i>I didn't feel a need
to go to college.</i>
<i>And I wanted to work with cars.</i>
Yamashita!
Sweep up, okay?
Tidy the place up.
The boss is coming today,
and bringing a new worker.
I finally get Muramatsu trained
and he quits on me.
I trained him.
Did not.
Did so.
Did not.
I'm going home.
My mother misses me.
But you can't go home again,
can you?
I envy you, Yamashita...
you're young and carefree.
Look at me.
<i>I've got my problems, too.</i>
<i>For example...</i>
<i>there's an old lady pushing 70...</i>
<i>who insists on having
a young man at her side.</i>
<i>She's my grandmother.</i>
Hurry and fill her up!
Morning! Let me clean your
ashtray, granny!
Wiseass!
I ain't your granny.
I forget what she likes.
"Grandma."
The English word.
Let me clean your ashtray, Grandma.
Shiro!
This is my grandson.
And this here's my new...
"Sidekick"?
Don't worry. He speaks Japanese.
Yeah.
Why the long face?
What's a "new sidekick"?
New boyfriend.
You're kidding!
He's your grandma's squeeze?
Today's elderly.
Back to work.
Sweep up.
Let Yamashita do it.
<i>My grandmother.</i>
<i>An American wannabe who insists...</i>
<i>I call her "Grandma."</i>
<i>She's often my greatest ally.</i>
Yes!
But...
just stop calling it a "gas stand".
And I'll make sure your father
shuts up about it.
What do I call it?
I've heard "service station."
Don't be stupid.
Say "gas station."
It's a "gas stand."
You be quiet.
But why that?
There's no need for you
to start working yet.
Wait till after college.
If you want to work with cars...
go to college first, then get
a job at an auto company.
Boring!
You're too damn orthodox!
I think it's a great idea to
work at a gas station.
That's my grandson!
<i>It was no contest.</i>
<i>My docile parents proved
absolutely no match...</i>
<i>for my free-thinking grandma.</i>
This thing's busted!
It needs coins.
You mean I gotta pay?
It's a "vending" machine.
Oh really?
Found an apartment yet?
Still looking.
Well, get with it.
You defied your folks.
It's only proper you leave home.
On my salary?
Don't be a pussy!
Listen carefully.
Give yourself 3 years.
If you aren't an independent
man by then... quit.
And start cramming for college.
My grandson's got to be tough.
Boss? It's the boss.
I'm the boss.
No, "the" boss.
Our boss?
Here already?
In a yellow car, too!
Well, I'm off.
New paint job.
It's great.
From pineapple to mango yellow.
Oh, your new employee.
Yo Fuji!
How's it going?
I love it.
The gas station.
Full of romance.
A rest stop for drifters.
Drifters, huh?
Go get 'em.
Come again.
Yamashita!
Clean out your locker.
Greet Miss Watanabe.
Please wait a minute.
Go ahead.
Oh, those are mine. Sorry.
Um...
I'm new at this kind of work.
I see.
But I'll work hard.
Do you have a hanger?
A hanger. Let me see here.
Here.
What, this?
Don't Believe the Truth by Oasis.
Know it?
The third track, Lyla, really rocks.
Um...
I can do better.
Do you mind if I change?
Oh yeah, of course.
Ouch.
Take your time.
You're lucky, Yamashita.
You're young.
I came to Tokyo 15 years ago.
Held 8 jobs...
deceived by 11 women.
Then I got into debt.
I've done it all.
I have.
Let's go, boys.
What? Come on!
If I'm late, my wife leaves me
an inch of water in the tub.
You're pathetic.
Where's the "drifter"?
The new girl.
I invited her.
I did.
Hurry it up!
Good night!
Sorry about that.
Anyway, Noriko here caught her man
with his ex-girlfriend.
What a jerk!
Could've been a relative.
No way.
He'd been double-timing her
for a while now.
That's awful.
You need a faithful man.
Mine only cares about muscles.
But it keeps him honest.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I need a guy who only has
eyes for me.
Right, honey?
Right!
Oops, I missed one.
Stop poking.
Farewell Tokyo!
Thanks for the memories!
Just get in the car.
My name is "Fuji-ko."
Hence, Mt. Fuji.
Pretty stupid, right?
Crummy photo, too.
Taken by an ex-boyfriend.
It was lying around so I hung it up.
I hope I never see him again.
Take a seat.
My tofu stew is to die for.
Traditional is nice, sometimes.
Thank you.
It's good.
What'll you drink?
I'm here for a farewell party.
Gas station crowd, right?
They all left.
I see.
Leaving?
Let me find you a ride.
That's all right.
Unless you're meeting a boyfriend,
the streets are too dangerous.
But...
Don't you have one?
A boyfriend?
Someone take her home!
I have one... lots of them!
Lots?
Boy friends, yeah.
You're lying.
Shame on you.
Grandma?
"Boyfriend" is a title reserved only
for guys you've slept with.
You're embarrassing me.
"Lots", huh?
Don't get cheeky with me.
Stop it.
Cheeky!
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>She's Japanese but...</i>
when I called her "granny"
as a kid...
she slapped my wrists...
and screamed
"call me Grandma!"
And I have ever since.
Her different habits and beliefs...
have greatly influenced me.
But she can be a little pushy, too.
I'm really sorry.
Is that her influence, too?
My bag.
Do you always carry
girls' bags for them?
Not always.
<i>In the past...</i>
<i>I tried to live by Grandma's
"ladies first"policy.</i>
Shiro!
I like you, too.
<i>It was misinterpreted.</i>
I can carry my own bag.
You're creepy!
<i>Some responded negatively to it.</i>
<i>One or the other.</i>
<i>How would she react?</i>
Well... good night.
Good night.
<i>Which is it?</i>
<i>Which?</i>
So which is it?
Why do you want to see
an Indian movie?
Just look.
Not here.
There's a scene where
Madhuri Dixit dances in the rain.
Gyrating like this.
I was told I resemble her.
In kind of a mature,
voluptuous way.
Who told you that? Huh?
An idiot?
It's not here.
Talk about mature and voluptuous.
Pardon me.
Hey, "Train Vixens"!
"Free My Willy"!
"Star Whores lll"!
"Finding Nympho"!
That girl attends a good college.
I bet she's rich.
She just opened the classifieds,
closed her eyes and pointed.
On a whim.
She won't last.
I'm going for lunch.
Time to burn rubber.
- Be back soon!
- Gotcha.
- Hold the fort!
- Gotcha.
Dispose of this.
Okay.
Thanks.
Be careful!
How dorky.
Welcome!
Premium fill up!
You okay?
Sure.
Just someone I'd rather not
see, that's all.
What about you?
Is there someone?
Someone?
A face you never
want to see again.
No.
Not really.
You've never been
in love, have you?
No wonder I feel good
around you.
You're lucky.
What time do you finish?
How's "Grandma"?
Stop teasing.
I'm not. That's what you've always
called her, right? Why change now?
Besides, I like the way you are.
And I like "Grandma".
If I like you, then I must I like her.
I mean, seeing how much
you take after her.
Wait a second.
Did you say you like me?
Yes. Problem?
You lose!
Supple wrist.
Wow!
Magic!
Play the song.
Oasis, track 3.
Not track 3.
The sun is crowning the tip
of Mt. Fuji.
You can only get that shot
twice a year.
"Diamond Fuji."
A brief moment when Mt. Fuji
sparkles like a diamond.
You didn't know?
No, we didn't.
With a photo like that...
timing is everything.
Whatever. Who cares?
I just don't have anything else
to go on that wall.
That's not it.
I like this song.
Well, not me.
Sorry.
<i>A long time ago...</i>
<i>"Grandma" was a cocktail waitress...</i>
<i>at the Officer's Club on base.</i>
<i>She fell in love with
a blue-eyed G.I.</i>
<i>They became lovers.</i>
<i>But it didn't last.</i>
<i>She called it a "great love."</i>
<i>My father called it "being dumped."</i>
<i>Either way...</i>
<i>the object of her affections
at the height of her youth...</i>
<i>disappeared overseas.</i>
<i>That love affair...</i>
<i>created her love of all things...</i>
<i>American.</i>
<i>"Gas stations"...</i>
<i>"rest stops for the romantic drifter."</i>
<i>The truth is...</i>
<i>that's who she hoped she could be.</i>
<i>Someone who drifted overseas.</i>
<i>Or perhaps...</i>
<i>someone waiting for a drifter
to return.</i>
<i>Maybe she's still waiting.</i>
Excuse me.
Yamashita here.
I'm still at work.
<i>Bring gasoline.</i>
<i>I wanna die!</i>
<i>Maki came back from Nagoya.</i>
<i>To see Yoko.</i>
<i>They've been meeting in secret.</i>
<i>Did you bring the gasoline?</i>
What, to kill yourself?
Then I'll kill him.
Get a grip, Naoki.
Anything to get her back.
That's nuts.
If it's over, it's over.
Not for me it isn't!
She chose him, right?
You can't force her back.
Consider her feelings.
I'm not like you!
I'm not smart.
I know that.
Yoko's all I got.
She's my life.
That's why...
I can't lose her.
I just can't.
Naoki...
You don't understand!
Delivery!
Queen size bed!
You a delivery man, too?
Yellow... color of safety.
Can you really support yourself?
Sure, you're single now.
But wait till you have
a wife and kids.
Will your gas stand job suffice then?
It does for a lot of people.
I'm talking about you!
Is that going to be your life?
Let him go.
Hey, nice pad!
Not bad for a hand-me-down.
Was this bed forced on you, too?
Let's see.
Knock it off, Grandma.
I just heard something snap.
She came alone to the bar, you know.
She feels lonely when you
work the late shift.
So I told her.
Wanting to see someone
more than once a day...
is a sure sign of love.
And?
We folded cranes.
It's great for loneliness.
Want to give it a shot?
No thanks.
You're almost her boyfriend.
I am?
Next is a kiss.
And then...
you know what.
Wait, did she say that?
Did she say that?
Girl talk.
I'm proud that you're
taking things slowly.
<i>Why do women...</i>
<i>like discussing the progress of
their love affairs with others?</i>
<i>Is that...</i>
<i>an indispensable...</i>
<i>facet of girl talk?</i>
Noriko...
Hi.
Hi.
Something wrong?
No.
You seem angry.
I'm not.
But...
It's nothing.
Walk me home.
Really?
The boss is afraid of his wife.
If he's late, she drains most
of his bath water.
No way.
He bathes like this.
That's silly.
She won't let him fill it.
Cold?
No, I'm fine.
Thanks.
No.
He emailed me.
Asked me what I planned to do
with his apartment key.
That's all.
If he wants it back,
he should just say so.
So you're angry.
I'm not.
Okay.
It's not your problem.
I'm sorry.
You sure?
You never want to see him
again, right?
Will you be all right?
He's a medical student.
Surprisingly ambitious.
He's more serious than he seems.
He should be here.
There.
Nori...
<i>Who is that?</i>
Do you care?
Not really... here.
I only need the key.
<i>I remember...</i>
<i>hearing as a child...</i>
<i>the words of a TVcomic.</i>
<i>"No, no!"means "Yes, yes!"</i>
Men are fools.
"No" never means "Yes."
<i>I didn't know what she was
talking about.</i>
<i>So I assumed "No"
simply meant "No".</i>
<i>Later...</i>
<i>when I understood more...</i>
<i>I believed the phrase to be a
misguided male perception.</i>
Hello?
I don't believe you!
Why'd you leave me?
Why'd you leave me alone?
Answer me.
Say something!
Tell me!
Don't just stand there!
Why'd you do that?
You don't get it, do you?
I've... fallen for you.
I think...
I love you.
I do.
Thanks.
You need clothes.
I've got clean sweats.
I'll take you home.
Unless you'd...
rather stay.
No.
Okay.
"No" means...
"Yes", you know.
For one person only...
they mean the same thing.
<i>When Grandma invited us out for
a drive, Noriko was the first to accept.</i>
<i>They had become...</i>
Here, "Nori".
Thanks, "Fuji".
<i>... fast friends.</i>
- Yum!
- See?
<i>It wasn't bad, though.</i>
<i>The sudden outing...</i>
<i>wasn't bad, either.</i>
<i>I didn't mind if we...</i>
<i>drove till dawn.</i>
<i>Those were my feelings but...</i>
<i>I didn't think we'd actually do it.</i>
Grandma?
Come on.
You okay?
<i>My grandma...</i>
<i>had come to find...</i>
<i>the scene in that photograph.</i>
<i>The very spot her former
lover had stood.</i>
<i>She'd come to see...</i>
<i>with her own eyes...</i>
<i>what he had seen.</i>
<i>But... it was wrong.</i>
<i>This looked like the place.
But it wasn't.</i>
<i>The photo had been taken...</i>
<i>somewhere else.</i>
<i>Neither of us...</i>
<i>dared...</i>
<i>tell her.</i>
<i>With a little more planning
and research...</i>
<i>the right spot would've been
simple enough to find.</i>
<i>This wasn't it.</i>
<i>But we couldn't laugh about it.</i>
Let's go.
Wake up, sleepyheads!
We're going.
Back to Tokyo.
Non stop.
<i>From that moment,
Noriko and I...</i>
<i>were nearly inseparable.</i>
<i>It was plainly obvious...</i>
<i>that I'd found a girlfriend.</i>
<i>Someone to fuss over.</i>
<i>Someone always...</i>
<i>on my mind.</i>
<i>Nothing could beat
seeing her smile.</i>
<i>It was... perfection.</i>
<i>Pretty soon...</i>
<i>she was everything to me.</i>
Shiro?
On your 19th birthday...
I'll leave the dormitory.
Can I live with you?
Deal?
Thank you.
You gave him Shiro's address?
They're friends, right?
He's Noriko's ex.
"Ex" what?
You're slow.
Ex-beau.
"Ex-beau"?
What's a "beau"?
Here you are.
Wait.
Nori.
Open up.
Come on.
Please.
You living with him?
I plan to.
With a gas stand attendant?
He's sweet.
He doesn't come barging in
on people, uninvited.
He's not you.
Hey, Gill. What's up?
<i>Won't work.</i>
What?
This.
Why?
Because...
Don't touch that!
This doesn't suit you.
Don't touch that!
You need me!
You need me.
Let's start over.
I need you, too.
I promise...
I won't hurt you again.
I won't betray you.
Give me another chance.
You can't be serious.
It's impossible.
It's too late.
Too late.
You took too long.
Why come now?
Shiro!
I can't face Naoki but...
I came to apologize to you.
For getting you involved.
That's all I wanted to say.
Naoki said...
he'd kill you to get her back.
I told him he was crazy.
But...
I think I finally understand...
his feelings...
I do now.
I understand.
Shiro...
you're in love?
I'm talking about Naoki.
How much he loved her.
So...
I know.
Believe me.
That's why I won't give her up.
I'll love her even more.
Take care.
You, too.
Hi.
Hi.
Where'd you go?
Not telling.
Shopping?
Not telling.
What did you buy?
Not telling, either.
Go change.
What're you making?
I said I'm not telling.
Need some help?
Raining again?
I'm so sorry.
Why, are you making it rain?
Nope, can't be helped.
Noriko's taking a leave
of absence.
Exams.
Don't apologize.
You're a student.
It's tough.
I remember.
Grandma holds an annual event.
A Christmas party.
Come. It'll be fun.
"In honor of your 70th birthday"
"And a life lived in good health"
Congratulations.
And now!
For a commemorative photo!
What is that?
How about some tofu stew?
I'd love some.
Cooked slowly with tender
loving care.
Like Shiro.
Well, he's grandson after all.
His goodness runs real deep.
He's steeped in it.
Relationships that are allowed to
mature over time and effort...
can be the best kind.
You've been a stranger.
Grandma?
I need to apologize.
About what?
That photo.
The one your ex-boyfriend took.
It's Lake Yamanaka.
At dusk, not dawn.
I know because...
I've been there.
I heard if you succeed in seeing
"Diamond Fuji"...
<i>your wish will come true.</i>
<i>So I went.</i>
<i>That was a day...</i>
I've been trying to forget.
Truth is...
I still remember.
Silly me.
Lake Yamanaka, huh?
I'm sorry.
Must've been painful.
All this time.
I'm angry at myself for not
being able to forget.
And ashamed.
But I'll try...
by Christmas.
You're having a party, right?
Come.
Of course.
Just be yourself.
Don't hold it in.
Cry if you'd like.
It'll be just between you and me.
Girl talk.
<i>When something fragile...</i>
<i>seems about to break...</i>
<i>What choice do I have but to</i>
<i>treat it gently.</i>
<i>All I could do...</i>
<i>was to keep believing.</i>
<i>To believe...</i>
<i>in her.</i>
<i>I believed...</i>
<i>in her.</i>
<i>I believed.</i>
We're all here.
So eat, drink and be merry!
Ready!
If you sample food and it doesn't
taste right, you put it back.
If you try on clothes and
they don't fit right...
you put it back.
But...
when you buy on impulse...
you can always return it
if you have the receipt.
What's your point?
Shiro?
You've been returned.
Stop waiting around.
I'm not waiting.
Noriko was...
always a "drifter".
I don't even want to see her face.
Good for you.
It's about time you felt that.
You're one to talk.
Who's the one who can't stop
waiting around?
Taking down a photo you pretend
not to care about.
Then putting it back.
It's pitiful... embarrassing.
Pathetic!
No, you're pathetic.
And childish.
You don't...
understand a thing.
<i>And so...</i>
<i>it ended.</i>
<i>Christmas...</i>
<i>had ended.</i>
She quit today.
She just left.
Shiro!
She can't be far. Go.
You're cool.
Ouch.
You're lame.
He ran over me.
<i>Shiro... Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>I know you won't believe me...</i>
<i>but ourtime together...</i>
<i>meant so much to me.</i>
<i>You were wonderful.</i>
<i>Thank you...</i>
<i>for such kindness.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>We had a deal, didn't we?</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
Can I live with you?
<i>Deal?</i>
<i>Forgive me.</i>
<i>Goodbye.</i>
Listen.
Just remember this.
For when you truly fall in love.
Remember what little girls
are made of.
"Softies" get dumped.
Got that, "idiot."
"Idiot"?
Numbskull.
A man's got to know when to be
gentle, and when to get tough.
Suck on this and ponder.
Sugar gives your brain its
nutrients, you know.
<i>That's when I noticed something
forthe first time.</i>
<i>Written on the box of caramels
my grandma had...</i>
<i>in old-fashioned type...</i>
<i>"Rich in Nutrients"</i>
<i>"Sublime in Flavor"</i>
<i>A good description.</i>
Finished my rounds.
Good work.
Let me introduce you to...
our new recruit.
You're lucky to be young.
And free of problems.
All my friends from school
are balding now.
<i>Truth is, I've still got
plenty of problems.</i>
<i>For example...</i>
How are you, Son?
Found a good cram school for you.
<i>My folks haven't yet given up...</i>
<i>on my going to college.</i>
<i>My 70-year-old grandmother...</i>
<i>grows younger each day.</i>
<i>Something I must learn to live with.</i>
Check under the hood.
<i>But the burning issue for
me is learning...</i>
<i>when to be tough...</i>
<i>and when to be soft.</i>
<i>I still don't understand.</i>
Welcome!
Oh, hello.
<i>Do I make a life of...</i>
<i>sweat and grease...</i>
<i>my career?</i>
<i>It's a question...</i>
<i>I can't yet answer.</i>
<i>But I have to admit...
I like where I am.</i>
<i>Someday, I will again...</i>
<i>fall in love.</i>
<i>Truly...</i>
<i>in love.</i>
Excuse me.
Oh, thank you.
Pardon me.
<i>Pretty soon...</i>
<i>I'll be 19.</i>
