Boulevard of Peasants,
late 19th century...
and, uh,
The Ice Cream Man.
Yes, yes, that's great.
Thank you, John.
I think we've seen enough.
So, every single one
of these copies...
were done
by the same man.
No. Excuse me.
They're not copies.
They're all
quite original...
but they are
all fakes.
Ah, remarkable.
And all painted
by the same man.
Harry Donovan.
Why haven't we heard
of him before?
Because he's clever.
He doesn't do big names
like Leonardo or Van Gogh.
It's always third-
or fourth-tier names...
that don't
attract attention.
He flies under the radar.
Well, he's amazing.
Well, you asked
for the best...
and he's considered to be
the best in the world.
Which leaves just one
final question.
Where do we find him?
Well, you've made it.
And you promise to buy
some paintings, ok?
Hey, Troy,
nice to see you.
You're looking well.
You're looking great.
Harry, what are you
doing here?
I got something for you.
You're kidding.
Why would I kid you?
No, no, I mean
it's marvelous.
Look, uh, I've got
a gallery full of people.
Is there any way
we can do this tomorrow?
No. I'm busy tomorrow.
You want this or not?
Yeah, ok.
It's beautiful.
Exquisite.
Yeah.
You know, Harry, your fakes
are always better, aren't they?
Maybe that's part
of your problem.
No. Part of my problem
is I like my money.
Here.
Maybe you want
to count it.
No. I trust you.
Hey, could you do
another one for me?
Harry?
No.
Why?
'Cause I'm doing
my own stuff...
and because you lied.
What?
You lied.
We said 3,500.
No, you said 3,500.
I said 4,000...
and since I know you're gonna
turn it for 90...
Hey, look, uh, wait.
Wait. Ok, here.
Ok?
If you have anything else,
call me, ok?
Hey, Picasso,
where's my rent?
Oh, live it up, Trump.
Is that it?
Yeah.
You're late.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna
have to bill you...
for the hour
I've been waiting.
I'll give you 50
for the wait.
Are you ready?
Oh, forget it.
What?
I'm finished.
We haven't even started.
Do you want to work later?
Please leave.
Harry Donovan, I presume.
We deal primarily
in 20th century artists.
Now, one of our clients...
a private collector
from Korea...
Hey.
Not very polite.
From Korea...
recently made a number of
purchases from us.
They were minor works
by modern masters.
So what?
So my client's
retained me...
to find an important work
by an old master.
Well, is there
any other kind?
As you can imagine, there's
very little available to buy.
Most old masters
are locked away...
in the permanent collections
of a few museums.
Well, you got
a big problem there.
Good luck to you...
and good-bye.
We're here because
we want the best...
and we're prepared
to pay for it.
$50,000, U.S.
You speak English?
Against 500,000
on delivery.
$500,000 for what?
Mr. Donovan...
I want you to paint me
a Rembrandt.
But only Rembrandt
can paint Rembrandt.
Yes, well, under
the circumstances...
can you help me?
No.
Why not?
Because with modern testing
it's almost impossible.
That and... Hey!
I'm not a shoemaker.
I don't deal with slobs
off the street.
I work with people that I know.
You can leave now.
It's a circular problem.
Now do I have to knock
your ass down the stairs?
No, no. Gentlemen.
Um, we'll be staying
at the Carlyle until Sunday.
Think it over.
Watch your fingers.
Never heard of them.
It's an Alistair Davies, an Iain Ill.
La Salle Gallery.
They're big art dealers.
You're in some
pretty fancy company.
Well, they want me
for a job.
Rembrandt.
Rembrandt, huh?
I'm moving up
in the world.
Well, that's a matter
of opinion.
You think
I shouldn't do it?
It's not a question
of shouldn't.
The question is
that you promised me...
you were gonna get rid
of this forgery shit.
That's the point.
Yeah, well, these guys
are real art lovers...
and 500,000 is a nice
round number, so I...
Can I ask you
a question?
What about
your own show?
Remember that?
"My own show."
What the hell do you want?
I'd like to see
an original Harry Donovan...
hanging in the Prado
one day.
Oh, shit.
Not in your lifetime.
I can sit down,
for Christ sakes.
I'm not a child.
Ah, now...
the Prado,
in my opinion...
is maybe...
the greatest art gallery
in the world.
All the world goes to Madrid
to see the Prado...
and the only way you're gonna
hang in that place...
is if you're dead.
I mean, Rembrandt
even had to be dead.
Well, then I'll have
to settle for 5 days...
on the beach
in Puerto Rico.
What would you do with a half
a million dollars, Dad?
That's not
the point.
You don't think
I can do it.
No, no. That's
not the point.
$500,000 is the point.
No it isn't! I'll tell you
what the point is!
Maybe It's my fault. Maybe
I should have told you sooner.
All right, what I'm
trying to say is...
I don't know.
The point is that Harry Donovan
should have gone to Italy...
and he should have
looked at da Vinci.
He should have
looked at Lippi.
He should have looked
at Caravaggio.
He should have looked
at sculpture of Donatello.
He should have
seen them.
He should have done
something, right?
You know why
you don't?
You don't have eyes.
Well, what's going on
here, Dad?
Why are you
beating me up?
I'm not beating you up.
I'm just trying to say
that even Rembrandt had to study.
Rembrandt never
laid a foot in Italy.
Bullshit. If there was an exhibition
of one of the greats...
within 100 miles
of Amsterdam...
Rembrandt was there.
Well, I'm not
Rembrandt, Dad.
You're not even
Harry Donovan.
Then you show me.
What?
I said, you teach me.
Why don't you
take me to Italy?
You show me
all that stuff.
Christ, you're a better
painter than I am.
Oh, not anymore.
I get a car,
we drive all around Italy.
We'll go to Venice, we'll go
to Florence, we'll go to Rome.
Then Caravaggio, Michelangelo,
Raphael, all of 'em.
And we'll stay in fancy
fucking hotels...
those paupers
could never afford.
And that's
how we do it.
And we can
do that now.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Here's the number of my account in Zurich.
When the first 50,000 clears,
that's when I start.
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Harry?
Not unless you know a Rembrandt
that's getting restored...
anywhere in the world.
One might imagine
that that would be your job.
I didn't think so.
From now on, don't call me.
I'll call you.
The age of romanticism...
raised you
to cult status.
The greatest genius ever to put
brush to canvas, they called you.
But by the age of reason,
they considered you an outcast...
your promise unfulfilled.
Chiaroscuro.
Light from the dark.
Delacroix said you were
greater than Raphael.
Renoir said, " I sniff the gravy.
He chews the meat."
And another Dutch painter
who had died penniless...
said you left him
staggering.
Vincent said you must have died
several times to paint like that.
A case like this,
there's only one way to move.
Not to make up
something new...
but to discover
something...
the experts are already
expecting someday to discover.
Something recorded
but lost.
His most moving paintings
were self portraits.
Like an autobiography,
they tell a wordless story...
a story of genius
and sorrow.
Now, one of Rembrandt's
most famous sketches...
is of an old man
who appears to be blind.
It's been speculated he did it in
preparation for a full oil portrait...
and that portrait has never been found.
It may not even exist...
but according to the inventory
at his bankruptcy...
Rembrandt sent 2 canvases
to Spain by sea.
It's recorded only as a portrait
of a man. No name.
We know the dimensions
were 92 by 71 centimeters.
We know the price
was 800 Dutch florins...
but the picture
disappeared.
Maybe lost at sea,
maybe stolen. No one knows.
The trail goes cold...
and it's been cold now
for 350 years.
Disappeared, how?
Nobody knows.
Lost at sea, burned...
stolen by Napoleon's generals.
Nobody knows.
That's where
the trail stops.
The trail
stops where?
Somewhere off the northern
coast of Spain.
The only record we have
is by Van Oilenberg...
who was the leading
Dutch expert at the time.
He saw the painting
before it left Holland.
Described it as the most moving
portrait he had ever seen.
It's a blind man believed to have
been Rembrandt's father.
The irony
being stunning...
the master of light,
son of a man who couldn't see.
So, I'm going to discover
Rembrandt's greatest portrait.
And I'm gonna paint it.
<b>Excusez-moi.</b>
I am sorry.
Someone pushed me,
and I...
It's ok.
Forget it.
Forget it.
I needed some coffee.
I was falling asleep.
Well, I'll
get you one.
- No, no, no.
- Please.
Please,
are you sure?
Ok, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
Oh, are you
an artist?
Uh, no, I'm a student.
Ah, me, too.
How do you like
the book?
I don't like books.
Just look
at the pictures?
Yeah, ever since
I was a little boy.
Should I tell you something
funny about that book?
Well, there's nothing funny
about a 900-page book.
<b>Quoi?</b>
Any author that needs 900 pages
to get to their point...
shouldn't be allowed
near a typewriter.
Well, then maybe
you shouldn't read it.
Yeah, well, I have to.
I... Homework.
Well, study hard.
Thanks for that coffee.
Perfect.
Excuse me.
<b>Oui, monsieur.</b>
You speak English?
- Yes, I do.
- This painting.
It was removed
this morning.
Why?
Restoration.
Where is that?
On the mezzanine.
Yeah, uh, Tringham, see.
Yeah, I have to meet
some people in there.
I didn't really...
No, it's impossible.
No, no, no.
They said that
it was gonna be here.
No, no, no.
They said
it was gonna be...
Is there someone else here
I can talk to?
The supervisor.
No, she's not here.
Well, look, I've come
all the way from America...
You must go...
<b>Bonjour, madame.</b>
Hey, excuse me.
Hi, hi.
<b>Monsieur,
monsieur, monsieur.</b>
Uh, the cafe, right?
Remember me from the cafe?
Do me a favor.
I got to get into this room...
to see a painting
that's being restored.
I'm having a little trouble
with my credentials.
Oh, come with me.
I'll take you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
She said you were
a professor.
Harry.
Marieke.
You on the staff
here, Marieke?
No, no, a student.
And you?
I'm working on a book.
I thought you don't
like books.
I hate my work.
What's your book about?
Dutch masters.
What aspect?
Portraits.
Has it been retouched?
No, no, it's still
untouched.
What do you feel?
About what?
The painting.
It's not bad.
Not bad?
Come on, professor.
Cou can do better than that.
What do you feel?
What I feel?
Um, it's one of the last
great paintings...
by one of the last
great painters.
Sold for 80 bucks...
while he died broke,
in debt, alone...
unrecognized, unable to even buy
one of his own paintings.
That's what I feel.
What do you feel?
Marieke.
Excuse me.
Harry.
Harry. Yeah.
Come and have
a drink with us.
Oh, no. I got... I...
Come on.
Uh, you know what Fromentin
said to a class once?
He said that Rembrandt
doesn't have anything...
like the attraction
of a Van Dyck...
uh, Francia,
or even a Reubens.
You're right. At first sight,
his work can be very displeasing.
I remember just before
he died, Fromentin...
you know what he said?
He said that Rembrandt has all
the subtlety of a dull guillotine.
Don't you agree,
professor?
Actually, I always thought
that Fromentin didn't know...
what the fuck
he was talking about.
I beg your pardon?
I just don't understand why
you guys have to sit here...
and piss on other people,
let alone Rembrandt.
Professor Scheerding
proved that the painting...
The Man With the Golden Helmet...
is just a cheap fake.
I'm sure you know
that in 1930...
there were over 800
supposed Rembrandts.
And now we're down to 241...
thanks to you
and your friends...
and dropping...
so bully for you.
Every school kid's
favorite picture is now junk...
'cause some self-important
windbag has said so.
The problem is...
in 10 years' time, there's not
gonna be any Rembrandts...
just a big pile
of theses.
We have said something
to offend you?
Me? I'm never offended
by flatulence.
I just move
away from its smell.
Bye.
<b>Excusez-moi.</b>
An American asshole.
Bien. It must feel good
to get rid of all that.
All that what?
Anger.
I'm not angry.
Oh, just something
out of your childhood?
No, just some fun.
A rather sad way
to have fun.
Now, is this why you followed me
all the way out here...
to tell me about
my sad childhood?
No, but I wonder why
you act like one.
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.
I'm sure you have better things
to do with your time.
Such as?
Listen, it's not d...
Now I'm hungry.
Want to get
something to eat?
Oh, merde.
I forgot my keys again.
We might not get in my room
if he doesn't wake up.
Oh, oh!
Oh!
Ahh.
Hey.
Where you going?
I have to go.
I'm so late.
Are you married
or something?
Married?
No.
No, but I have to be in Venice,
like, this afternoon.
I hope you realize this is not
my nightly routine.
I think maybe
you're teasing.
No, I'm not.
You, uh, want
to have some dinner?
I... I can't.
Ok.
Bye.
I have to rush.
You just leave the key
at the desk.
It's beautiful,
isn't it?
Actually...
it's terrible.
But I love
this frame.
Yeah, yeah,
I'm coming.
Harry Donovan.
I can have some of these resins
for you by tomorrow.
Burnt Sienna,
it's no problem.
But Tamarack...
I need them all
by Friday.
Friday?
I also need a complete chemical
breakdown of these varnishes.
Ok. Anything else?
I need 20 grams
of lead weight.
Lead weight?
And it has to be
over 160 years old.
So the radioactive half life
is down to zero.
Can you get it for me?
You know, this will
raise a lot of eyebrows.
Half now...
half on delivery.
Red legs, leaden yellow, black...
you have here vermilion.
Pure vermilion. No extenders.
No one uses it. Very difficult.
For this azurite pigment...
cobalt blue is ok?
No, no, no. No cobalt blue,
no blue manganese.
Azurite.
Azurite?
Very, very old stuff.
It was cheap
300 years ago, but today...
How much?
50 grams for...
600 marks.
Done.
You should be able to extract
20 grams from this.
I need genuine
badger hair brushes.
2 dozen, in this size.
Ox hair, squirrel hair...
and a half a dozen
of these red sable.
Well, where are you?
Amsterdam.
Oh.
How is it?
Expensive.
I was in Amsterdam,
I think it was, uh...
It was 1951, and I remember
the guilder was 4.8 to the dollar.
I'm getting 1.7.
Hey, you're lucky
you're getting something...
besides cheese from the Dutch,
you know that?
Yeah.
How's it going?
Good, yeah.
Painting away.
You being straight
with me?
Yeah.
Miss you, Dad.
You what?
Miss you, Dad.
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm... I'm... I'm, uh...
I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
N... Nothing.
I'm a little tired.
I tell you what...
you know, these things cost a lot
of money, these phone calls...
so why don't we just...
kind of break them up, you know?
Give me a call in
the next couple of days, ok?
Yeah.
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you.
Good-bye.
Harry?
So 350 years later...
we pick up the trail
of Rembrandt's lost masterpiece.
Now, the boat sailed from Rotterdam
to San Sebastian, Spain...
so we're within
a 40-mile radius...
of where the trail
might have gone cold.
Do you have
a local farmer?
Taken care of.
So let's see what he's gonna find
in his cellar, shall we?
Ha ha.
Hmm.
It's been baked
at 225 degrees 3 times.
Rembrandt usually did 3 versions
of the same painting...
one on top of the other.
That'll show up
on the x-rays...
which is exactly what
they expect to find...
exactly what they're
dying to find.
It's incredible.
It's marvelous.
It's stunning.
It's payday.
I love the little rip,
Harry. Great touch.
You've thought of everything
except one thing.
His signature?
Exactly.
I thought of it.
I thought better of it.
Oh, and why was that?
Because it's too obvious.
Rembrandt didn't even
sign half his stuff.
And every idiot con man around
the world signs all his fakes.
They're looking for that.
It's smarter not
to give it to them.
Smarter for you,
but dumber for us.
I mean, the signature alone is worth
5 million if the painting's any good.
And you'd rob Fort Knox
for 100 million...
and still bend over
to pick up a quarter...
which is dangerously dumb,
and I hate working with the dumb.
The only reason you won't sign it
is because until you do...
you've committed
no crime.
I'm not here
to smooth your exit.
Now sign the painting.
I've done hundreds of fakes
all over the world...
signed, dated, initialed, unsigned.
I know art experts.
You don't tell them what you have.
You let them tell you.
Call Richard Bright
and Andrew Westerbrook.
Invite them here to Spain
at my expense to see my new find.
Tell them we suspect it may be
an uncataloged... Díaz de la Peña.
Ha.
Now let's go and see
our Spanish tiller of the earth.
What's his name?
Juan Del Campo.
We can deal with him.
The generous
40 bucks.
That's right.
Yeah, well, there you have it, eh?
Peasant fantasy days.
50,000 pesetas for selling us
an old painting...
he never had
found in his cellar.
Where's my 50,000 pesetas?
Well, let's see what our
London experts say first, shall we?
If it passes muster with them,
you'll be paid in full.
Cash on delivery.
Of a Rembrandt.
But I don't have
a Rembrandt yet, do I?
Because I don't
have a signature...
so until somebody
tells me otherwise...
I have a bloody
Díaz de la Peña, don't I?
Oh, that's really good.
Are you still teaching
a course there?
Oh, yes.
It's unsigned,
but I think it might be...
an early, uncataloged
Díaz de la Peña.
Oh.
Yes, an uncataloged de la Peña
would be wonderful.
Wouldn't it?
Where's the champagne?
Right behind you,
Alistair.
Ah, thank you.
Well, gentlemen,
good health.
Cheers.
Good health.
Everybody ready?
That's not de la Peña.
It's not?
Where did you say
you bought this?
I thought I might have
discovered an old Spaniard.
Well, it is
a discovery...
but it's not
an old Spaniard.
It's Dutch.
This is a Rembrandt.
Are you serious?
No way.
Harry, you'll get paid
on the approval...
I don't get paid on approval.
I get paid on delivery!
Which is now.
My client's not going to pay
$5 million for a Rembrandt...
without some
kind of Dutch opinion.
But don't worry, Harry,
as soon as we get back to London...
you'll be paid in full.
Provided we have
favorable opinion.
Jesus!
Taxi!
This is only the second time
in my entire career...
that I have participated
in a discovery of this magnitude.
The Van Dyck
in Goteborg.
No. That was Biedermeier.
I authenticated the Triptych
in the Basilica.
Yes.
You're not going
to believe this.
Shall we telephone
my client?
No bloody way.
We're not going
to sell it...
to your Korean friend
for 5 million...
when we can make £30 million
at auction.
Auction?
What?
Well, I know they'll
be committed, but...
a public auction's
dangerous.
I think we'd be putting
our entire reputation at risk.
Really? Is that what
you were thinking?
Well, Iain...
my reputation
isn't worth £30 million.
How much exactly did you think
yours is worth?
Why do you let him
abuse you so?
Well...
it's called discipline.
He'll dispense of you.
No, no.
I'm biding my time.
I'm happy to let him think
he's in control.
When the time's
right, he's gone.
Then we go to
a gallery in Tokyo.
You got
your passport ready?
'Cause we are 48 hours
from Italy.
No, I'm not kidding. I got
the tickets right here in my hand.
That's great.
Yeah. Well, we're gonna
do it all, Dad.
We're gonna
do everything.
All right.
Bye-bye.
So Wednesday's a bank holiday
in Switzerland...
so you can wire the money
into my account on Tuesday.
That'd be fine.
Where's the fourth?
You said there was gonna be 4.
No idea.
We're still waiting.
Well, screw 'em.
First come, first served.
We're gonna be down to ginger ale
and breadsticks in a minute.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I've been circling...
You're here now.
That's all that matters. Hello.
Sorry. Hello, hi.
Angelica.
Ooh, you're here. Hi.
Ohh.
Ooh.
Oh, my God.
It's magnificent.
As soon as I laid eyes
on it, I knew.
Young thought
it might be Boet.
No. I was only eliminating
other possibilities.
Incredible, isn't it?
Oh, truly it is.
Have any doubts?
Well, based purely
on connoisseurship...
I'd say...
it's brilliant.
But it's not Rembrandt.
What?
I don't feel
it's Rembrandt.
Why?
I don't know.
I don't have any objective
criteria to base it on.
I just don't quite get the same feeling
as when I look at others...
I disagree. I think it strongly
suggests Rembrandt's own hand.
Yes, it's consistent with
the artist's early Leiden period.
Listen, it's stunning.
And I'd like to think
it's authentic...
but I feel it's not, but...
Oh... hi.
I... I wouldn't want
to go on record...
until I'd seen the results of chemical
analysis and x-ray testing and...
We asked you here for
your considered artistic opinion...
based on your
connoisseurship.
We'll be pleased to provide you
with all the data you desire.
I don't want to take up
more of your time.
No. I'm sure you
must be exhausted.
Allan, will you see
the professor to her taxi?
Well, sorry I have
to rush again.
It's really unfortunate.
You have my mobile number.
Bye.
Uh, well, gentlemen,
more champagne.
I understand
what she's saying.
Well, oh, a student.
What?
You told me
you were a student.
I told you the truth.
The truth?
You're M. M. Van Den Broeck,
you phony...
which you neglected to mention
when I saw you in Paris...
reading your book
for the 15th time.
It was the finish
of my father's research.
Yeah, yeah,
but you wrote it.
And then you song and danced me
at the Musée.
I was a student
in Paris.
I was studying art restoration,
professor.
I never said I was a professor,
my dear. You did.
Look, what happened in Paris
was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
I must go now.
I'm late for
Covent Garden.
What, the fucking opera?
You breeze in for 2 minutes
to see Rembrandt...
then 4 hours
at Rigoletto?
La Boheme. And sadly,
I can't even stay for all of it...
because I have to catch my train back
to Venice tonight at 10:00.
Will you listen
to me?
Alistair Davies knew this
was a Rembrandt all along.
He's the one who sent me
to go do research.
He knew it wasn't
Díaz de la Peña.
He just used that line to steal
the painting away from the Spaniards.
And the only reason
he's got you all here...
is to make him
look honest.
But I'm not so sure
it is a Rembrandt.
Well, if it's not
a Rembrandt, what is it?
I don't know.
Maybe a student...
maybe someone
from his circle...
maybe nobody.
Nobody.
What do you mean
a nobody?
Look, it's too perfect:
Composition, eyes, texture,
brushwork, everything.
But I feel something missing
that makes me doubt it.
But mine's
only one opinion.
You have 3 others.
That's enough to get you to auction.
What do you mean,
auction?
Covent Garden.
What do you mean, auction?
I know it's disappointing.
That's 3 out of 4.
If that's none out of 4.
It's one opinion.
The one that counts,
you idiot.
She's the expert's expert.
She's the chief consultant of the
Rembrandt Committee. We're dead.
Harry!
Harry,
what are you doing?
I signed on for private placement,
not public auction.
Why not go for 30 million
instead of 5?
Because going public
is for pigs like you.
With that you're asking
every fool on the globe...
to stick his nose up the ass
of this thing.
Well, doesn't your work
bear scrutiny?
If I thought it was
smart to go public...
I wouldn't need a fucking
middleman, would I?
You're the middleman.
Any idiot can
paint a picture.
It takes genius
to sell it.
You wouldn't know art if Michelangelo
stuck his maulstick up your ass.
I'm warning you.
You filthy pimp.
Just give me
the painting.
Harry. Harry, don't!
You are the worm
in the stomach...
of every painter
that ever lived.
You bastard!
Iain.
Ring the police. Now!
Shira!
Harold Donovan?
What do you want?
Inspector Deeks.
We'd like a moment of your time
if you don't mind.
I mind.
Where were you, sir,
at approximately 9:00 this evening?
Right here.
- Do you know Mr. Alistair Davies, sir?
- No.
Have you been in the
La Salle Gallery of fine art...
at any time tonight?
No.
That's not what
Mr. Davies says, sir.
Nor what
Mr. Iain Ill says.
Nor did Professor
Marieke Van Den Broeck says.
And what did she say?
That you were there
observing a Rembrandt.
Rembrandt?
She said Rembrandt.
Among other things.
Wow, you got me
confused...
which means I am drunker
than I thought.
Cancel that
last Guinness, please.
Would you step outside
with us, please, sir?
It's raining.
It stopped.
We'd like to talk to you...
about the contents
of that tube.
Well, great,
but the tube's mine.
Not according to
Mr. Alistair Davies.
He's full of shit now,
isn't he?
Put the tube down, sir,
and turn around.
What for?
Please, turn around.
Hello.
So now it's
a Rembrandt.
I never said it was.
I've never seen...
All right, can you
do me a favor?
Can you keep this
intuition bullshit...
to yourself
for a couple days?
Just 2 days.
I need to sell this painting.
But he's pulled me out
of the opera.
They're trying to bust me
for stealing, which I didn't do.
- Aren't you leaving something out?
- What?
Like the man you shot
in the gallery.
The who?
Who did I shoot?
Please tell me it was Davies.
You killed that man.
You murdered that Japanese art dealer.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
No, I did not.
Hey!
Listen!
I'll miss my train.
No, you won't.
Oh!
Oh, excuse me.
Sorry.
Hang on.
What's the matter now?
Have you got
my passport?
No, you've
got passports.
Tickets, please.
Listen!
- Ow!
- Wait!
Breakfast bell
will be rung at 8:00.
Miss?
Miss Pringle.
Uh, right, sir.
Have a nice journey.
Help!
Help!
Oh!
Please!
Don't do that.
Are you going
to kill me?
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't have a gun.
I don't want to hurt you...
but I will.
Now, I'm going to sell
that painting...
because as far as the world's
concerned, it's a Rembrandt.
And the only person who thinks
that it's not is you.
So you give me 48 hours
before you kill it.
2 days and then
you're free.
You'll never be able
to sell it.
Ok, Professor.
We've got full alerts at all the
airports, ferries, and train stations.
They contacted the FBI
for anything they've got on him.
Passport.
Shit!
Sergeant, get that.
What is it?
If you're really innocent,
you'd be stupid to run like this.
I didn't murder anyone.
Don't tell me,
tell the police.
Let justice
run its course.
If justice
ran its course...
Van Gogh wouldn't have
died broken in a nut house...
while Irises sold for 50 million
to some insurance goon.
Oh, so Van Gogh
gives you the right...
to steal this picture
and sell it.
No, doctor. What
gives me the right...
is I didn't steal it.
I painted it.
What?
I said I painted it.
I don't believe you.
I don't care
what you believe.
What are you saying?
I am saying that
it is my painting...
because I painted it,
so I'm going to sell it.
I see. All that,
that gallery, this picture...
this is just
one big fraud.
Fraud? When are you
going to realize...
that all of this
art crap is a fraud.
Otherwise, how could the same picture
be worth 10 million or zip...
Based on what,
a signature?
Rembrandt is priceless,
Donovan is worthless...
that's not art...
that's autographs.
It has been known
for a gallery...
to arrange to have
a picture stolen from themselves.
What possible end,
may I ask?
Insurance money,
perhaps.
That's ridiculous.
It's not insured at all.
We're out-of-pocket
20 million pounds.
And more importantly,
Inspector...
we've lost our closest colleague
Mr. Agachi.
There's evidence that Donovan
and Van Den Broeck...
may have known each
other previously.
At least as far back
as a month ago in Paris.
My God.
They're in collusion.
To do what, sir?
To fleece us.
Don't you see, by calling
the painting a fake...
I'd have to sell it
pennies in the pound...
then they'd turn around
and sell it at full price.
And failing that, Donovan
simply stole it and...
murdered Tom
in cold blood.
Right in front of us
like some maniac.
Professor Van Den Broeck
said she was unconvinced...
of the painting's
authenticity.
Inspector, if it weren't
absolutely genuine...
then why would
they steal it?
Porter, why has
the train stopped?
We're backed up, sir.
Police search.
I'll take this one.
Porter,
come unlock this door.
2 days.
Ok, you don't
have to...
Whew!
Hello, can I get
2 pints, please?
2 pints, you say?
Right.
You, uh,
have a telephone?
A phone. Ha ha ha.
You've come to the right place
for a phone...
I'll tell you that.
We have here the original
restored phone box...
used by Lord Mountbatten
to call Winston Churchill...
on the very night that
Field Marshal Montgomery...
received his command.
There's a plaque
on the back wall.
And where is that?
Around and behind.
All right. Come on.
I have a collect call
for a Mr. Felix Darmene...
from Harry Donovan.
Go ahead, please.
Felix, yeah.
Look, I've got
something for you.
Yeah, a once-in-a-lifetime
thing... Dutch master.
Can you get it here
to Geneva?
Look, you interested?
We'll be happy
to have a look.
Help!
- Help!
- Hey!
Help!
Hey!
Open up!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Stop it!
Oh!
Bastard!
Be careful!
You bloody yutz
bastard!
Destroyed
a bit of England!
Come here!
Ladies,
if you don't mind.
Keep chasing the snow!
Now, my dear,
that was rude.
In the middle
of a phone call.
Are you trying
to get us killed?
What are you doing
with me?
I'm in this paper
like some criminal.
You don't believe
that I killed that guy.
It's a lot easier than believing you
painted that picture.
Oh, that's right. You are
the expert, aren't you?
I didn't paint the Rembrandt
that isn't the Rembrandt.
I killed the guy
that I didn't kill.
Oh, and we didn't
make love in Paris.
Not to mention you killed
Mr. Churchill's phone box.
Seems that the door
was stuck, wasn't it?
And I'll tell you, that
happens again, I'll ruin you.
And it's going to take a lifetime
to clear your name...
'cause I'll tell them that you were
in it with me from the beginning.
I swear to God, I'll turn your precious
little reputation into dog shit.
What?
Dog shit! Poo-poo?
So get it.
From now on, we are friends.
Let's act that way.
You don't have
any friends.
Oh, yeah,
why is that?
You're an ogre.
You don't like people.
What?
You don't like people.
Oh, I like people.
Name one.
I like people.
One more day with me while
I try to fence this painting.
You spend one day
with the ogre.
Oh, I'm shivering.
I'm so cold.
Come on,
move along here!
Did nobody ever tell you
about stealing?
What's that rule again?
You all right?
Great.
You feel hot.
Ohh.
Do you have any money?
Why, you want
to steal it?
Yes.
Too bad, 'cause I...
I lost my purse
on the train.
Marieke.
Thank you.
Kid's got talent.
Hmm... Are you sure
that's Gainsborough?
It's killing me
to part with it now.
So, what are you
asking for it?
Ah-choo!
Guess what?
Classic car.
Austin Healey stolen.
Canterbury.
Did they get
a license plate?
691 TDT.
It's Ampicillin BK,
500 milligrams...
so just take one
every 4 hours.
You know a lot
about pharmaceuticals.
My grandfather.
Was a pharmacist?
Yeah.
Your father, too?
Painter.
Ashcan School.
Sloan, Bellows,
Hopper.
Taught me how to draw.
I taught me
how to make a living.
When did you first
make a living?
My mother had just died. My father was
scraping by illustrating auto manuals.
Painting when he could.
Did an oil...
Workers in
a machine shop.
It was quite a painting.
Couldn't sell it
for 10 bucks.
So one day I took it...
fooled around with it
for a couple of hours...
went downtown and sold it
that day for a grand.
How did you feel?
Sick.
And I think he knew.
Then why didn't
you quit?
'Cause I was young.
Money, denial, I don't know.
Met the wrong guy
at the right time.
Friend of my dad's.
Not a very good painter,
but quite a hustler.
And he taught me
every style in the world.
Except your own.
Is everything fake?
No.
No.
His work's been hanging
at the Scottish National Gallery...
for the last
3 years now.
Excuse me.
We've got some
good news for you, sir.
Come through.
We confirmed your account
that the picture was uninsured.
So, uh,
where's my painting?
We believe he's
still got it, sir.
You believe!
Apparently, they got off
the French-bound train last night...
just ahead
of our own people.
We believe they're
still in Britain...
but, uh,
for all we know, sir...
he could have made it anywhere
in the world at anytime.
It's a Rembrandt!
He'd never mail it.
I'll mail it to you.
It's hotter than a pistol, Harry.
Nobody will touch it.
Oh, come on,
are you telling me...
every time they steal
the Mona Lisa...
there's a hundred people
waiting in line to buy it.
Are you telling me
this is hotter than that?
Every time they
stole the Mona Lisa...
they never killed
anybody.
Yeah, but Dimi...
Dimi...
Don't call me again, Harry.
I don't want to buy
your problem.
Fuck!
There's a million dollars
out there for this picture...
and that prick Davies
has fixed it.
The entire legitimate,
semi-legitimate...
semi-illegitimate market
is dead to me.
You know, you're
losing your mind.
You're as ravenous as
those vultures you hate so much.
So stop pretending to be some
martyr outside of it...
because you are it.
Are you finished?
With all this outrage...
you could be signing
your own name.
My father signed
his own name...
Please shut up
about your father.
This is the only thing
I have to give him.
You're not doing this
for your father, Harry.
You blame your father
for your failure.
What the hell do you know
about failure, doctor?
You inherited your racket.
You were given
your library gig.
So what do you know
about failure?
Maybe nothing.
Maybe I am exactly
what you say I am...
A woman stuck
in a book.
- That's right.
- A safe place.
But failure's a safe place
for you, Harry.
Doing your own work,
that's a risk...
but you don't use
your talent.
You simply
don't have the...
Guts.
Guts, yes.
Coming from the woman who never
took a risk in her life.
I'm taking one
right now.
I am not an artist,
Harry, but I love art.
Oh, will you
do me a favor...
and don't talk to me
about art?
Don't even say it!
Art was my dog's name.
Oh, that's obvious.
There's no real beauty in you.
Not really.
You're in it
for the paycheck.
Oh, who isn't?
Do you think the garbageman
ain't in it for the paycheck?
'Cause he sure as hell
ain't in it for the garbage.
You're talking about
a job, Harry.
I'm talking
about a gift.
Get ready, people.
The bus is leaving
in 2 minutes.
Excuse me.
Yes or no, Colin?
There's a fellow
in Birmingham...
uh, name of Offul.
He'll fence just about anything...
but he cuts pretty deep.
How deep?
100,000.
Thames Bridge, midnight.
£100,000 for a Rembrandt?
Dollars.
Thames Bridge, midnight.
I'll tell you what,
I'd rather burn it, you son of a bitch!
If I get caught,
I want you to mail this for me.
The London bus
is leaving right now.
Give me, uh, 12 hours
before you blow the whistle.
Give you 12 hours?
Yeah.
I kissed you
on a bridge.
We made love under one.
I think you can trust me.
It's not what I...
It's not what I said.
Excuse me, luv,
how much for the painting?
What, that?
It's not for sale.
It's me dad's, isn't it?
Well, pick a high number, dear.
You like it that much?
50 quid, then.
Oh!
Rembrandt Van Rijn, I presume.
You got the money?
May I see the goods,
my dear?
100,000?
I owe you 100,000.
Did we say dollars
or pounds?
Oh, what the hell,
let's make it pounds.
It's a Rembrandt,
after all.
May I owe you
a million pounds?
Ugo,
settle the debt.
Aah!
Aah!
It's not the bloody
Rembrandt!
It says Rembrandt.
You stupid ass!
Franz Richard Odebaker.
Belgian School. One of his
most important works.
Outside of Belgium.
Ha. If only you stuck
to Belgian masters.
Hello, John.
Hello, Harry.
It's been a while.
How's your dad?
How's Milton?
Not great.
You know,
I always maintained...
that you were the
most brilliant I ever saw.
Well, I got to lay off
this painting, John.
I'm sorry, Harry.
Like Moses, you can see
the promised land...
but you can't
step foot in it.
Yes, I can.
Come on, Harry,
this is Chess.
The grand masters
never play it out.
I am not leaving
with nothing.
You may leave
with less than nothing.
Pray for nothing.
Harry...
I'd better tell you
something.
I was the one
who put Davies onto you.
I hoped for the best.
I never imagined it would
turn out like this.
Forgive me, please.
Harold Donovan, you are
under arrest for murder.
Son of a bitch.
The painting.
Get... Get that painting!
We will prove...
that the defendant
Mr. Harold Donovan...
attempted
to participate...
in the brokerage
of a Dutch master portrait...
That when he realized...
he would be excluded
from the transaction...
he became enraged...
that when he realized
he'd be left with nothing...
he stole
the masterpiece...
using violence...
robbery.
He killed one
of his former partners...
murder.
He resisted arrest...
assaulted a policeman.
He fled.
And we recovered
a Lincoln-Levinson semiautomatic...
photographed and dusted it
for fingerprints.
And were there any fingerprints
on the handgun?
Milord, I really must
ask Mr. Turley...
kindly to stop
leading the witness.
I will rephrase
the question.
What did you find
on the gun?
A thumb smudge
on the barrel...
belonging to
Mr. Alistair Davies...
and a clear
right forefinger...
on the trigger
and trigger guard...
belonging
to Mr. Donovan.
He's not answering.
Would you like to leave a message?
Yeah, yeah.
Please tell him
that his son called...
and that I...
Hello... Hello?
Hel...
Who was
in the gallery?
Tom, Iain, and I.
We had just decided
to go ahead with our plans...
for a private sale to
a client of Tom's in Korea...
when suddenly,
Mr. Donovan burst in...
and demanded
the Rembrandt.
Naturally,
we all protested...
but he took the painting.
That's utter bullshit.
Mr. White, would you please
exercise some control...
over your client?
Professor Westerbrook...
You have had
an opportunity...
to examine the painting
in question, have you not?
I have.
As professor of fine art...
at St. Matthews College, Oxford...
and as an advisor
on old masters...
to her Majesty the Queen...
what conclusions
have you reached?
In my opinion...
the work is indisputably
Rembrandt Van Rijn.
A masterpiece.
Authentic.
Rembrandt.
It's a fake.
Is it possible you might
have a personal reason...
for not being
entirely truthful...
on behalf
of the defendant?
No.
You've said he handcuffed you
and kidnapped you?
Yes.
Although, at the time
of his apprehension...
I don't believe anyone
remembers you wearing handcuffs.
Are you in love with him?
Really, Milord,
perhaps my learned friend...
could explain
the relevance...
Milord, it is
entirely relevant...
concerning as it does
the witness' motives...
in giving evidence
here today.
You must answer
the question, please.
I did not love him
when I first saw...
and pronounced this painting
not genuine.
And you had
no involvement with him...
before you saw the painting
for the first time?
No.
Really?
When were you last in Paris,
Professor Van Den Broeck?
Um...
4 months ago.
And where did you stay?
Hotel Lyon.
Milord,
with your permission...
I would like to admit
this note into court...
written to the defendant...
and signed
by the witness.
Professor Van Den Broeck,
would you be so kind...
as to read
that note aloud...
to the court?
"I had to go..."
We cannot hear you,
Professor.
I... I suspect also
that members of the jury...
may be having a little trouble
with your delightful accent.
Yes, please.
Speak up.
"I had to go.
You were wonderful.
To R.V.R., Marieke."
Will you tell us, please...
what R.V.R. Means?
Rembrandt Van Rijn.
Thank you, Professor.
Professor, I submit that
your evidence is worthless...
and your credibility
highly questionable.
Is my learned friend
cross-examining...
or is he making a speech?
Call Maurice Scheerding.
She said he was a friend.
He was a patronizing,
arrogant bore.
And I can tell you...
he does not know his art
from his ass.
And tell us... what were
they doing in the bar?
Translation, please.
Uh, making the beast
with 2 backs.
And what does that mean?
Sexual congress, Milord.
No, no, no.
They were fucking.
When Mr. Agachi stepped forward...
to prevent you
from stealing the painting...
did you fire the gun
at Mr. Agachi?
Yes...
but I didn't kill him.
I was trying
to make a point.
Look, I... I have
a studio in Amsterdam...
and I can prove
all these things.
You'll prove what,
that you didn't kill him?
It's all part
of a conspiracy?
A conspiracy for what?
Conspiracy to commit
armed robbery.
Of what?
Rembrandt's portrait
of his father.
Except that it's my portrait
of my father.
Now, look, I...
They took it away,
but I had a picture.
And... and if you could see it...
you'd be able to see that...
What?
The eyes...
That I gave it
my father's eyes.
Mr. Donovan, please.
The portrait may have,
but the eyes...
No. I painted my father's eyes,
and I distorted it.
I painted it over and over in the
same way that Rembrandt would've.
If you take a look at the x-rays,
you'll be able to see that.
Sir...
have you any idea how many men
step forward each year...
to claim credit
for Hamlet...
or Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony?
Do you know how many people
are convinced...
that they are the czar's
long-lost nephew...
Napoleon...
even Jesus Christ?
Well, I'm not Jesus...
But I painted
that painting.
No more questions, Milord.
What a day.
What a day.
What a monumental day.
You know, Harry,
you were absolutely right.
Signing that painting would've
been a grievous error.
Please accept
my sincere apologies.
I do hope you know...
how much I truly admire
your work.
Well, not enough
to pay for it...
but then, it's all a pile
of shit anyway, isn't it?
And as for the public...
well, you see,
they're told what's art...
by me.
And you forgot that, Harry.
Or you never knew it.
When this yen-soaked tycoon...
couldn't wait to throw
his money away...
it was because I said
the painting was a steal...
at 5 million.
So...
what in the world
were you thinking...
when you took
my Rembrandt?
You could've had half a million...
and a towel on the beach.
Instead, you're here...
destitute...
like all the others.
So Van Gogh sat in a room
in a mental hospital...
painting sunflowers.
You can cut off both your ears...
but unless I say you're a genius...
you're just another lunatic.
Oh, by the way...
well, this is old news...
but...
I'm sure he died a proud father.
The last time I was with him,
he yelled at me.
You know, I should've
taken the time.
I didn't get it.
He was sick
in his heart.
He never judged me.
Never, ever was he anything
less than beautiful to me.
He loved you.
And I betrayed him.
No.
Yeah.
He had a gift for me,
and I didn't see it in time.
I missed it.
No, what you see now
is his gift to you.
We have
one last chance...
One thing to do.
Milord, the defense
requests permission...
to have the defendant
Mr. Harold Donovan...
demonstrate his expertise
here in open court...
by reproducing
the disputed painting.
Milord,
we have just heard...
from 5 scientists
and other experts.
Having the defendant
now here in court paint...
wouldn't be evidence
of anything.
It would be evidence
of artistic expertise, Milord.
By recreating the picture
in his own hand...
Mr. Donovan can support his claim
to authorship of the disputed...
Milord, even if he reproduced
Whistler's Mother here in court...
would that make him
Whistler?
Milord, there is ample
precedent for this...
in the 1947 trial of the Dutch master
forger Han Van Mirdrin.
He reproduced his counterfeit
Vermeer paintings...
in open court.
That was in Holland, Milord.
I really can't see
the relevance of the country.
I will permit it.
But, Milord...
I'm tired of hearing
about all this.
I want to see it
for myself.
Court will adjourn while
you prepare this demonstration.
All rise.
You can forget your
membership at my club.
Now we're screwed.
Calm down, you idiot.
Nobody's screwed.
If he succeeds,
the painting's worthless.
The whole thing's
falling apart.
It took him a whole month
to paint it...
under perfect conditions.
The best he's going to come up
with now is a sketch.
He's going to prove
the case for us here.
Right.
Hi.
Hello.
You know, when I went
to the gallery...
there were three of you.
Now there are two.
I guess pretty soon
there will only be one.
Really?
One can't be
too careful.
Court is now in session.
Is the defendant ready, Mr. White?
He is, Milord.
Very well. He can begin.
What happened
to your own show?
Remember that?
You promised me you were going
to get rid of this forgery shit.
That's the point.
Not even Harry Donovan.
Harry.
Harry, come on, please.
Go on.
What are you doing?
Has your client finished,
Mr. White?
Only Rembrandt
can paint Rembrandt.
See, Iain?
Nothing to worry about.
We were lucky.
I make my own luck.
Yes, Mr. Turley?
Uh, call Mr. Iain Ill, please.
Now get up there...
and try not to make too big
a fool of yourself.
Mr. Ill, will you tell us,
please, in your own words...
what happened on
the night in question?
Yes.
There was a dispute over
the sale of the Rembrandt.
Alistair wanted to cut
Mr. Donovan out of the deal.
There was an argument.
Mr. Donovan tried
to take the painting.
Alistair
pulled out a gun.
There was a struggle.
Mr. Donovan
got hold of the gun.
He humiliated Alistair...
fired a shot...
Aah!
Over Tom Agachi's head...
missing him...
Stole the painting
and ran.
Are you ok, Tom?
Then Alistair
picked up the gun...
covered it
with a handkerchief...
Iain.
Ring the police. Tell them
there's been a robbery.
And a murder.
Aah!
Who shot Mr. Agachi?
Alistair Davies.
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!
You... You bastard!
You pitiful...
fucking rat bastard!
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you,
you bastard!
Clear the public gallery!
Officers, bring that man
before the court!
You understand that you will
be held in contempt of court...
for this very serious
and prejudicial outburst?
Milord, we will
request a retrial...
based on the nature
of the eruption...
and its effect on my client's
attempt to exculpate himself.
Yes, Mr. White.
We will hear those arguments tomorrow.
Milord, it would be
interesting to know...
why Mr. Ill found it necessary
to make false statements...
during the original
police inquiry.
Because I was terrified.
I've always been afraid
of Alistair. Always.
I am the only witness
to the murder he committed.
I know it would only be
a matter of time...
before he
got rid of me, too.
Alistair Davies,
I understand that you have been
placed under arrest...
by the police.
You will be taken from
this building in their custody...
and in my view, you should
be held without bail...
until your trial.
Mr. Turley, in view
of these developments...
do you still seek a conviction
in front of this jury?
We do not, Milord.
Members of the jury,
I will shortly invite you...
to enter formal verdicts
of not guilty...
on all outstanding
charges...
and, Mr. Donovan...
you will be free
to leave this court.
Thank you.
Clerk, we will take
the verdict.
Sold...
at £375,000.
Lot 22.
Portrait of a Blind Man...
by Rembrandt
Harmenszoon Van Rijn...
Subject believed to be
the artist's own father.
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
I'll start the bidding
at £4 million.
£4 million...
Gentleman on the aisle.
Yeah, will you tell her I called?
I mean, I tried everywhere.
I don't...
Yeah.
Well, tell her I'm here
and I'll wait...
but, you know,
tell her to come.
10 million... the gentleman
on the aisle over here.
£10 million.
£10,500,000...
The lady in the second
row at the back.
£18 million...
The lady on the aisle
in the back.
£18 million.
£18,500,000... gentleman
in the front row.
£18,500,000.
Would you wait for me,
please?
The gavel just fell...
$55 million.
Sold to a Hong Kong
hotel chain.
Guess where
all the money goes?
Don't tell me.
UNICEF?
The owner of the La Salle Gallery
of fine art...
Iain Ill.
I guess he goes home
a very rich man.
Maybe.
What do you mean,
maybe?
Did you mail
that letter for me?
Yeah.
What about it?
Oh...
maybe sometimes
means maybe not.
Ladies and gentlemen!
My lords!
Ladies and gentlemen!
Little bit of a hush.
Little bit of a hush.
Please, please.
Um, it gives me
great joy...
to welcome you all here
on this wonderful evening.
Um, as our great
good friends of many years...
have seen us through
some difficult times...
we'd like to invite you all
in a few weeks...
to the opening of our exciting
new gallery in Tokyo!
Um, of course...
we seem to have
run out of Rembrandts...
but there's still a lot
of fabulous paintings to buy...
so enjoy yourselves.
Cheers, everyone.
Well said!
Chong, Chong...
come meet E.L. Hand,
my assistant.
Thank you.
E.L., meet Chong.
Chong, this is E.L.,
my assistant.
We've got a problem.
Does the name Juan Del Campo
ring a bell?
Del Campo...
19th century linguist?
The farmer in whose cellar
the Rembrandt was discovered.
Oh, yes,
I remember him.
He got an anonymous letter
saying you cheated him.
He apparently hired
himself a lawyer.
Um, under Spanish law...
the government of Spain...
has the right to match
the purchase price...
of any painting deemed
a national treasure...
which this painting
now has been deemed.
Oh. Hooray for Spain.
Forget pounds. I'm quite happy
to take it in pesetas.
I'm afraid it's not
as simple as that, Iain.
The Spanish courts
have ruled...
he is the painting's
true owner...
and he gets
all the money.
This is insane.
They can't void a sale
just like that.
You're my lawyer. You've got to do
something about it.
That painting was sold!
And it remains sold.
It's just your money,
you see...
which makes its transfer
back to Spain...
All of it.
Mmm.
Very practical.
Thanks to you.
My grandfather remembers
you here a few months ago...
of course, when
you sent the letter.
He says you are an angel
for our family.
Of the 7 billion pesetas...
the government took 2/3.
And the church
took another half.
But without the letter,
he wouldn't have anything.
He wants
to give you half...
600 million pesetas.
$5 million.
That's very generous.
He wants to embrace you.
You are the angel
of the people here.
<b>- Gracias.
- De nada.</b>
<b>Amigo...</b>
where's the Rembrandt?
In Madrid...
In the Prado, of course.
<b>Sí, en el Prado,
en el Prado!</b>
Think it's, uh...
Genuine?
What do you ask me for?
Just want to know
what you feel...
Professor.
I'm not sure.
It's not signed.
