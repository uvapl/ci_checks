He honks the horn -I gets out the truck.

You see I don't know... I feel like men are more romantic than women.
When we get married we marry one girl.  Cause we're resistent the whole way
until we meet one girl and we think I'd be an  idiot if I didn't marry this girl she's so great.
But it seems like girls get to a place where they just kidna pick the best option or something.
I know girls that married they're like. Oh he's got a good job.
I mean they spend their whole life looking  for Prince Charming and then they
marry the guy who's got a good job  and is gonna stick around.
Take your share and go home okay? Let's call it a good night. -Thanks Jamie...

Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm not looking at you like anything. -Oh, Okay
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
What you thinking?
 What's on your mind?
You're never going to guess who I saw at the liquor mart.
Richard Greico?
No but good guess.
Jon Bon Jovi?
Bobby Ontario.
The fuck was he doing there? -I dunno... I mean... buying liquor I guess.
Jesus!
How come your just telling me now? -Cause I'm telling you now.
How come you didn't tell me while we were there?  -I don't  know cause I was flustered and I'm telling you now.
You talked to him? -No... I mean like,  Hi, by, how are you...?-How are you?
Yeah he asked me how I was. -And you told him?
I mean I didn't want to but we were stuck there in the same store
buying things together at the  same time.
I wish you'd seen him then you  wouldn't feel so bad. He's fat...
What do you I care? -I don't know. -What do I care if he's fat or not.
What does that mean?  Make me feel better?  -I don't know! Cause he's a loser!
What does that have to do with me? Whether he's a loser or he's fat or not? What the fuck do I care?
What?! -What are you saying that for? That would make me feel better he's fat?
So what if he was in good shape I shouldn't that I wouldn't that I shouldn't feel good?
I said the wrong thing. I'm nervous okay? -What do you mean your nervous? I feel funny, because you feel funny.
You're nervous cause I feel funny? What does that mean.
Yes. I feel like I said the wrong thing...  I feel like I shouldn't have said anything.
Really? That's an option?
You run into Bobby Ontario and  it's an option not to tell me?
I feel like you're upset and I upset you and I'm sorry. And I said the wrong thing.
Baby you do whatever you want.
Okay.

<i>Maybe a little in the beginning.
<i>He didn't really have any regard for me  as a person. You've gotta be careful of that.
You've gotta be very careful that the person you fall in love...
is worth it... to you.
<i>I don't ever want to be like my parents.
<i>I know that they must have loved eachother at one time right?
<i>Did thy just get it all out  of the way before the had me?

<i>I think you have the right to say  Yes I do trust...
<i>?..I trust myself.
What?
Shit! -What what?
Fuck!
Fuck! -I'm sorry.
<i>Somehow she didn't want to confess to  him  that she was so weary
<i>of all those people  who'd seem  to want to care about her.
<i>He touched her cheek gently, caressingly.
<i>Her heart was bitting so loudly  that surely he could hear it.
Arms up! <i>-He smooths your hair back</i>
<i>the touch of his fingers sending waves of awareness through her.
<i>He was going to kiss her... that whas what she wanted, wasn't it?
<i>So why that she feel as if she trembled on the  edge of the precimes ready to top ower in an instant.
<i>Then his lips founds hers and she stopped thinking at all.
<i>Only feeling. Feeling the tenderness of his  kiss,  the strength of his arms around her,
<i>the steady beat of his heart under her hand as she turned into his arms.
<i>There is a precipice and she was falling head  over heels. Falling in love with him. Chapter 11.</i>
-Hi! -Hi.

<i>thinking about it but I can't.
<i>Maybe I've seen too many movies  you know,
<i>love at first sight.</i> Anyone call? -No.
Thanks! <i>What do you think about  love at first sight?</i>
You think you can love somebody just by looking at 'em?
But the thing is, man, I felt like I knew her. You know.
You ever get that feeling? -Yeah like  you've seen her before and you just know her...
Yeah. -Yeah it's a feeling...but the  thing is, you actually don't know her.
Yeah I don't, right? -Right.
I felt like I did though.
If you get a little pussy, I think the mental-ness will get out your head.
I'm too much in my head, right? -Yeah, too much.
<i>Yeah, you already know where she live  at, right? -No she was just like visiting her grandmother.
<i>So why don't you go back to that grandmother and ask her where she lives.
<i>I should go back, right?
<i>Yeah. If you like her, yeah -She just  seems different you know? I don't know.
<i>Wait. How different?
<i>I dunno, I just got a feeling about her.

Hi. Do you know what happened to Walter? -Who? -Walter?

I don't know anything about anyone named Walter. -Oh,
Hey, can I ask you something else?
What's the story with that girl  that was in here like a month ago.
<i>The young blonde. I gave her my card  but she never called.

Shit!
Do you think I could sit down because all these other seats are taken?
Okay... -Hey, thanks...
You know I just talked to your grandmother...
That sounds weird, huh? -Yeah. -Okay let me put it into context.
I went out there to see Walter  who's not there anymore.
That's why I talked to her...
You know what happened to that guy Walter?
Yeah, you know what happened to that guy walter?
No I don't know what happened to that guy Walter.
No, what happened?
You gotta do it like that? -What do you expect?  -What do you mean? -They're old!
Do you want to live like that? -Like what?  No home? -Yeah.. -No I don't...
But I'm not getting old and he's a dummy  for dying. -Walter's a dummy for dying?
Walter's a dummy for dying? -Yeah. -What are you gonna do, wise guy?
Not do it...
Are you gonna die? -Definitely.
Hmm? What'd you say? -I said definitely.
Well with that kind of attitude you will.
Don't do it! It's for suckers.
Don't do it.
What are you gonna do? -Just not do it.
I went out there to give him this. Isn't that nice?
I found it.
Is that him? -Yeah, and his lady.  Isn't he handsome?
Look at her she's so pretty.
So she's probably nuts then...
In my experience the prettier a girl is, the more nuts she is.
Which makes you insane...
You're probably nutty-coo-coo crazy...
Its not your fault. Everybody treats you different.
Like you make jokes and people laugh  anyway even though they're not funny.
That's gotta make you nuts.
I like how you can compliment and insult someone at the same time.
In equal measure. -What's an insult about that?
That I'm crazy and I'm not funny.
I don't know if you're not funny,  tell me a joke.
So there's a child molester and a little boy walking into the woods.
The child molester and the little boy keep  walking further and further and its getting  darker and darker and they're going deeper and deeper
into the woods and the little boy looks  up at the child molester and he says:
Gee mister I'm getting scared!?And the  child molester looks down at him and says:
You think you're scared kid?  I gotta walk outta here alone.
You don't think that's funny?
No. I'm sorry. -I do.
You get along with your grandma huh?
Yeah, she makes me laugh...
Nobody else talks in my family.  And when they talk, they just yell.
I'm never getting married.
This is a nice place you live. You like it? -It's alright.
Where you wanna go? -I wanna go away to school.
What are you gonna study? -Medicine.
Really??
Yeah really! -Yeah right! -Yeah right?
Girls that look like you don't  go and study medicine.
What do I look like?
Girls like you are super-models.
You got any, like, talents? -Like hidden talents?
Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Adams,
Jackson, Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler, Polk i Taylor...
That's all presidents.
Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan! Lincoln, Johnson, Grant i Hayes.
Garfield, Arthur, Cleveland, Harrison, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft,
Wilsong, Harding, Coolidge i Hoover!
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon,
Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Bush!
That was rad.
Can you dance?
You can tap dance? -Can you? -No.
Here, I'll play a song and you dance.
OK?
Come here.
Come here, like this, right here behind  the heart. In front of the heart.
I can't really sing... I have to sing goofy  in order to sing like I'd to sing stupid.
Okey? -OK.
You're actually good!
OK, slow dance, slow dance to this part.
You're not gonna eat that? -Why don't you do something...
What do you mean? -I don't know.
What does that mean? -I don't know. Why don't I do something?
Like what? -I don't know. You're so good at so many things, you could do anything you wanted to do
you're good at everything that you do,  isn't there something else you wanna do?
Than what? Than be a husband, to be Frankie's dad?
What do you want me to do?In your dream scenario  of me doing whatI'm good at, what would that be?
I don't know, you're so good at so many things, you can do so many things.
You have such capacity. -For what?
You can sing, you can draw, you can...
Dance.
Listen I didn't wanna be somebody's husband
and I didn't wanna be somebody's dad. That wasn't my goal in life.
For some guys it is... Wasn't mine.
But somehow, It was what I wanted.
I didn't know that
and now it's all I wanna do... I don't want to do anything else it's what I want to do.
I work so I can do that.
I'd like to see you have a job where you didn't have to start drinking at 8 o'clock in the morning to go to it.
No, I have a job that I can drink at 8 o'clock in the morning. What a luxury, you know.
I get up for work, I have a beer,  I go to work, I paint somebody's house
they're excited about it. I come home, I get  to be with you. That's like... this is the dream!
It doesn't ever disappoint you?
Why? Why would it disappoint me?
Because you have all this potential. -I could  still do whatever I could do, so what, Why do you  have to fucking make money off your potential?
Look, I'm not even saying you have to make money off it. Don't you miss it?
What does potential mean? What does even potential mean? What does that mean?
Potential for what?
To turn it into what?
You know, we rarely sit down and have an adult conversation. Because every time we do
you take what I say and you turn it around into something that I didn't mean.
You just twist it.
Start Blabbing, blah blah blah  blah blah.
If you're not interested in what I have to say then maybe I just shouldn't say anything.
That's funny, huh?
What's funny about that? -Good luck.
I'd like to see you think about what you say instead of saying
what you think all the time.  Good luck, give it a try!
What are you doin?
You wanna fight me? -Yeah I wanna fight you.
Okay, there you go... -On your back.
On your back motherfucker!
Cheers, you're the best.

Why are you doing? What do you want?
That's how you want it?
This is how you want it? C'mon.
Baby I can't do it like this, I can't fucking do it like this.

They're sensitive in nature so if at any  time you're uncomfortable,  you just let me know, okay?
At what age were you when you first had intercourse?
...Thirteen.
Okay... That's not unusual.
How many sexual partners would you say you've had from when you first began?
...Maybe... 20...

Then I'm going to introduce a finger...your going to feel this... okay there you are...
Alright... that's it, okay, there we are...  deep breathing, that's it...
Alright I feel the uterus.
Its probably 11.5 To 12 weeks.  It's in a safe position for the procedure.
Okay I'm going to insert a speculum. It's gonna couse some pressure.
Here it goes...this is it...
I know it's uncomfortable...  I know it's uncomfortable.
As much as you can relax the easier it goes, okay.
It's set... good work.
Keep that breathing, breath hard...
The next thing I'm gonna do is  give you some local anesthesia.
Its a little uncomfortable...
Now I'm going to give you the first injection, take a giant breath and cough.
Good, breath... cough.
Okay, fine...
OI'll put that down and let it take effect.
Breathe deeply and slowly...
I'm going to apply and instrument so  I can hold the cervix still.
You shouldn't feel this, maybe a little  pressure, little move -I can't!
Hunny, are you OK? -Cindy?
Stop, Stop... -Okay, okay!
Okay I'm stopping, i will stop.
Alright you wanna sit up, okay, alright.

Thank you.
Let me see, -I don't know what you're talking about -Let me see. -See what? -Let me see...
Does it hurt?
Yeah. Like right now, when you're doing that. -Sorry!
Cindy doesn't usually bring her dates home for dinner.
So, uh, I'm thinking this might be serious.
Don't listen to him. -Well, I hope so.
You hope so. -Yes sir.
I mean I'm pretty serious.
What do your folks do, Dean?
Well, my mother, I don't know, to be honest, what she does.
My father is a janitor.
And a very talented musician.
What does he play? -Everything.
he can kind of play a little bit of  everything, he's one of those people.
So you don't see your mother? -No I don't. -Why?
Not that it's my business...  -No, I understand you asking.
I don't really talk about it very often, to be honest
She just... When I was, whatever, 10
My father and her just decided that it wasn't gonna work out.
and... she met somebody and I think... you know...
That was that.
You graduate from high school, Dean? -Well, sir, uh... no, I didn't, I didn't.
But I didn't feel like there was a place for me there, to be honest.
I don't think high school is  all its cracked up to be.
Cindy's studying...
I know. She's... -It's exciting.
She's about the smartest person I ever met.
How's it going?
It's good.. -Yeah?
Uh huh, its really good.
There's one teacher in particular that  I've really enjoyed getting to know
She says that I have a lot of potential.  -What's her name?
Professor Comstock. -Comstock!!
What's so funny about that?
Teachers, they just always have these names you know? Its never like... I don't know... They always have these names.
Comstock! -Is that funny? -Yeah.
I don't know why. Sorry. -What course is that?
It's a biology course.
That's good.
Cindy wants to be a doctor.
I know, that's, uh... she'd be a great doctor. I wish she'd be my doctor...
I'd trust her.
A lot of these doctors, they're just in it for the money.
It would make me relieved if someone like Cindy was my doctor, or my kid's doctor.
<i>She's got a lot ahead of her,  it's really exciting.
I know I'm not good enough for you.  -Stop it. -It's true, I'm not.
Baby, it's true. -It's not, you're  hurting my feelings. Don't say that.
No, but nobody is.
So as long as...
that's the case I want the job.
Baby! -What? -I got you a present.
That's it. Boom!
Oh, baby.
Did you make it?? -Well, I didn't  make it, but I got us a song.
You know like our song that will just be for you and me...
Becouse everyone's got songs... But they're lame  and they all share them. It's disgusting...
But not us. We've got our own song.  -We have our own song.
What is it? -You wanna listen to it?
<i>I love you.</i> -Stop it! -I love you too! Listen!
Baby!
Are you OK?? -I don't want to talk to you.
I can't play right now, okay?
What's going on, Dean?
Hey, leave her alone...
Hey! You can't lock me  out of my own house!
I don't have my oxygen out here!
You know, it's not just us, we got a little girl we gotta think about.
I know, I am thinking about her. I can't do this anymore.
I can't do this anymore.
Baby, you're just thinking about yourself. What about Frankie?
You want her to grow  up in a broken home?
Is that what you want? -I am thinking about Frankie.
You're not thinking about Frankie. -I am. -You're not.
Is this how you want her to grow up?
I don't want her to grow up in a home where her parents treat each other like this.
Don't...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry... -I can't do this anymore!
I know.
Baby I'm just fighting you know. Fighting for my family.
I don't know what to do,  I don't know what else to do.
Tell me what to do,  tell me what to do.
-I don't know what to do. -Tell me how I should be. -I don't know.
Just tell me, I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I don't know what to say
I'm so sorry, I don't know what else to do. -I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, just tell me...
We're not good together, we're not good anymore. -Don't say that, baby...  The way that we treat each other!
Don't say that, baby...  -I can't stop, you can't stop, I can't stop,
I don't know what else to do. -I can stop.
Come here. -No!, No!
Come here, just come here... -No, no, no...
What are you thinking?
I just wish they'd hurry up so you  can't change your mind.
Let's go, lets go...
Baby, you made a promise to me, okay?
You said for better or worse.  You said that.
You said it. It was a promise.
I'm sorry.
Now this is my worst.
okay this is my worst. -I'm sorry.
But I'm gonna get better. You just got to give me a chance to get better.
Come here please. Please face one another...
I'm sorry...
I love you so much...
Dean, I give you this ring... -As a symbol...
As a symbol... -Of my solemn vow... -Of my solemn vow...
And everlasting love... -And everlasting love.
For as much as you have consented in holy wedlock before God
I do, in the power vested in me
I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
Baby, baby...
You've got to just give me some space. -Thank you. -You're welcome!
<i>Hey Frankie, come back!
Daddy! Daddy!
Frankie, you got to go back, okay?
Daddy, Daddy!
Where is she? -She ran after Dean...
Go back to your mom please. Go back to your mom. -Just come back!
You want to race? -Okay. -Ready, 1..2..3... go!
Oh sweetheart, its okay, no, no, don't cry, its okay. Who's my big girl?
I love him. -I know baby...
Mommy's got you, don't cry, it's okay.
