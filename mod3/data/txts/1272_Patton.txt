Ten-hut!
Be seated.
Now, I want you to remember...
that no bastard everwon a war...
by dying for his country.
He won it by making
the other poor dumb bastard...
die for his country.
Men...
all this stuffyou've heard
about America not wanting to fight...
wanting to stay out ofthe war...
is a lot of horse dung.
Americans traditionally love to fight.
All real Americans
love the sting of battle.
When you were kids...
you all admired the champion marble-shooter,
the fastest runner...
the big league ballplayers,
the toughest boxers.
Americans love a winner,
and will not tolerate a loser.
Americans play to win all the time.
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell
for a man who lost and laughed.
That's why Americans have never lost...
and will never lose a war.
Because the very thought of losing...
is hateful to Americans.
Now...
an army is a team.
It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team.
This individuality stuff
is a bunch ofcrap.
The bilious bastards who wrote
that stuffabout individuality...
for the Saturday Evening Post...
don't know anything more about real battle
than they do about fornicating.
Now, we have the finest
food and equipment...
the best spirit...
and the best men in the world.
You know, by God, I actually pity...
You know, by God, I actually pity...
those poor bastards
we're going up against.
By God, I do.
We're notjust going to shoot the bastards.
We're going to cut out
their living guts...
and use them to grease
the treads ofour tanks.
We're going to murder
those lousy Hun bastards by the bushel.
Now...
some ofyou boys...
I know are wondering...
whether or not
you'll chicken out under fire.
Don't worry about it.
I can assure you that
you will all do your duty.
The Nazis are the enemy.
Wade into them.
Spill their blood.
Shoot them in the belly.
When you put your hand
into a bunch of goo...
that a moment before
was your best friend's face...
you'll know what to do.
Now, there's another thing
I want you to remember.
I don't want to get any messages
saying that we are holding our position.
We're not holding anything.
Let the Hun do that.
We are advancing constantly...
and we're not interested in holding
onto anything except the enemy!
We're going to hold
onto him by the nose...
and we're going to kick him in the ass.
We're going to kick the hell
out of him all the time...
and we're gonna go through him
like crap through a goose!
Now...
there's one thing that
you men will be able to say...
when you get back home...
and you may thank God for it.
Thirtyyears from now when you're
sitting around your fireside...
with your grandson on your knee...
and he asks you...
"What did you do
in the great World War II?"
you won't have to say...
"Well...
I shoveled shit in Louisiana. "
All right now, you sons of bitches,
you know how I feel.
Oh.
I will be proud...
to lead you wonderful guys
into battle...
anytime, anywhere.
That's all.
The Arabs need food and clothing.
They strip our dead
before we can even bury them.
Looks like the reports
were pretty accurate.
Sixty-one armored vehicles,
45 tons ofammunition, 2540mm guns...
three self-propelled 105's...
not counting mortars,
machine guns, rifles, pistols...
telescopes, belt buckles, G.I. socks.
1,800 men.
Our people salute you, General...
foryour brilliant amphibious landing
on the continent ofAfrica...
and, uh, foryour enlightened administration
ofour country.
I've enjoyed being here, Excellency.
Naturally, I'd prefer to be
in Tunisia fighting the Germans.
"The lions in their dens
tremble at his approach. "
- I appreciate that, Excellency.
Magnificent.
I wish our troops looked that good.
Tell me, General,
what do you think of Morocco?
I love it, Excellency.
It's a combination
ofthe Bible and Hollywood.
- These men fight at Kasserine?
- Yes, sir.
For the American Army
to take a licking like that...
the first time at bat
against the Germans-
Up against Rommel,
what we need is the best tank man we've got...
somebody tough enough
to pull this outfit together.
- Patton?
- Possibly.
God help us.
Lieutenant, where's the duty officer?
Sir, he, uh- Uh, I think
he's at his quarters shaving.
Why isn't he here on duty?
Guess he needed to shave.
We got a new commanding general due today.
Who the hell's kicking me in the butt?
Oh, sorry, uh, sir.
- What were you doin' down there, soldier?
- Trying to get some sleep, sir.
Well, get back down there, son.
You're the only son ofa bitch in this headquarters
that knows what he's trying to do.
Yes, sir.
- Brad. How the hell are you?
- Fine, George. Good to see you.
Hey, we were all under the impression
you wouldn't be here until 0900.
Yes, I gathered that.
- Uh, you know my boys, DickJenson, Alex Stiller.
- Yes.
Brad, tell me, uh,
what are you doing here?
Well, Ike wanted a report
on this Kasserine business.
Meanwhile, I'm to stay here
at your headquarters as an observer...
but I report directly to Ike.
A spy.
Get me General Eisenhower's headquarters.
Tell me, Brad, uh,
what happened at Kasserine?
- I heard it was a shambles.
- Apparently, evertyhing went wrong.
We'd send over a. 75mm shell...
the Krauts would return an. 88.
Their tanks are diesels.
And even when we managed to hit
one ofthem, they kept on running.
Our tanks-
The men call them
"Purple Heart Boxes. "
One hot piece ofshrapnel,
and the gasoline explodes.
Mmm, I warned them about the tank.
You know, I talked to one ofthe soldiers
about the half-tracks.
I asked him ifthe, uh, machine gun bullets
pierced the armor...
and he said, "No, sir.
The bulletsjust come through one side
and rattle around a bit. "
I understand we had a little trouble,
uh, coordinating the air cover.
- The trouble was no air cover.
- General Smith on the line, sir.
Excuse me for a minute.
Beetle?
Listen, I'm calling about,
uh, Bradley and hisjob here.
Look, I need a good
number two man...
and I wanna make Brad
my deputy commander, okay?
You clear it with Ike?
Fine, thanks, Beetle.
Ah.
Nowyou're not spying for Eisenhower anymore.
You're working for me.
- Okay?
- Fine. Okay.
Dick, you got those stars?
- Yes, sir.
- Let's get 'em on.
What's the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.
I know, but, uh...
it doesn't become official
until it's approved by the senate.
Well...
they have their schedule,
and I have mine.
George...
ifyou were named
admiral ofthe Turkish Navy...
I believe your aides could
dip into their haversacks...
and come up with
the appropriate badge of rank.
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.
You know, I think those stars...
would look better on a green shirt.
Did I ever tell you about the time
I designed a uniform for tank crewmen?
It was, uh, green leather,
had red stripes...
and sort ofa-a row of
brass buttons down across here...
and topped off by a gold football helmet.
The army rejected it, ofcourse.
Goddamn, it was beautiful.
Lloyd Fredendall'sjust leaving.
George, there's one other thing
I put in my Kasserine report.
Some ofour boys
werejust plain scared.
That's understandable. Even the best
fox hound's gun-shy the first time out.
I can rememberwhen nothing
frightened me as much as the idea...
ofa bullet coming
straight for my nose.
I don't know why, but the image
ofa bullet coming right for my nose...
was more horrible
than any other possibility.
Well, I can understand that, George,
with such a handsome nose.
You wanna know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it?
A blind man
could see it in a minute.
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.
Why should they be expected
to fight like soldiers?
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.
Well, in about 15 minutes we're going to
start turning these boys into fanatics, razors.
They'll lose their fear
ofthe Germans.
I only hope to God
they never lose their fear of me.
Up bright and early, General.
Uh, breakfast?
Am I to understand that all my officers
have finished breakfast?
We're open from 6:00 till 8:00.
Uh, most ofthe officers arejust comin' in, sir.
Please inform these officers
that the mess hall is closed.
But, sir, it's only a quarter to 8:00.
From now on,
you will open at 6:00...
and no one will be admitted after 6:15.
- Where are your leggings?
- Leggings?
Well- Well, hell, General, sir,
I'm a cook.
You're a soldier.
$20 fine.
Gentlemen, from this moment,
any man without leggings...
without a helmet, without a tie...
any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform...
is going to be skinned.
This is a barracks.
It's not a bordello.
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning, sir.
- Ah, Doctor.
- Sir.
I understand you have two cases
of, uh, self-inflicted wounds.
- Yes, sir, we do.
- Uh, get 'em out of here.
Sir, one ofthem's developed
a very serious infection.
I don't care if he dies.
Just get him someplace, but out of here.
He doesn't belong in the same building
with men that have been wounded in battle.
- I'll see that they're moved, sir.
- One more thing.
There'll be no battle fatigue
in my command. That's an order.
- Yes, sir.
- Battle fatigue is a free ride.
A yellow-belly's ticket to the hospital.
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.
- Yes, sir.
- Uh, Doctor?
Where's your helmet?
I don't wear a helmet
when I'm in the hospital, General.
Start.
I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.
Well...
then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can.
And get those yellow-bellies
outta here today.
Hold it.
Turn right here.
But, sir, the battlefield
is straight ahead.
Please don't argue with me, Sergeant.
I can smell a battlefield.
He was out herejust yesterday, George.
It's over there.
Turn right, damn it!
It was here.
The battlefield was here.
The Carthaginians defending the city...
were attacked by three Roman legions.
The Carthaginians were proud and brave,
but they couldn't hold.
They were massacred.
Arab women stripped them...
oftheir tunics
and their swords and lances.
The soldiers lay naked in the sun.
2,000 years ago.
I was here.
You don't believe me, do you, Brad?
You know what the poet said:
"Through the travail ofages...
"midst the pomp and toils ofwar...
"have I fought and strove and perished...
countless times upon the star. "
Uh-
"As ifthrough a glass and darkly...
"the age-old strife I see...
"where I fought in
many guises, many names...
but always me. "
You know who the poet was?
Me.
Sir, the interrogation
reports on the American prisoners...
...captured in our victory at Kasserine.
Danke.
They are not very good soldiers,
these Americans.
I'm not so sure...
...after only one battle.
Their tanks were no match for our guns.
And neither was their leadership, sir.
At Kasserine they were not
under American command.
They were under the
British General Anderson.
British commanders and American troops...
the worst ofevertyhing!
I remind you that Montgomery
is a British Commander.
And he has driven us half
way across Africa.
Anyway, we have met the Americans
for the first time and defeated them.
I'm optimistic.
You can afford to be an optimist, I can't.
There's an opportunity here now
for us to mount an offensive.
We've concentrated on
harassing the enemy's flank...
draw his strength away
from the British.
However, it appears now that-
Excuse me-
that we could split the Africa Corps...
and drive through Rommel to the sea.
I'm sorry, Bell,
but that territory's been reserved...
for General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery.
We're supposed to let him win this one
no matter how long it takes him to do it.
They're entitled to have their hero.
After all...
Montgomery did push Rommel
clear across North Africa.
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?
You have anybody in mind, George?
Excuse me, sir. Air Vice Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.
Excuse me, gentlemen...
while I ask our British friends
what's happened to our air cover.
Round one coming up.
- Harry. Glad to see you.
- Omar. How are you?
George, good to see you.
Uh, George,
you know Arthur Coningham.
- SirArthur.
- Delighted to see you, General.
I've heard so much about you.
Gentlemen, um, it appears there's been
some slight misunderstanding here...
and, uh, Ike thought that we ought to
get the whole thing straightened out.
No, no.
No misunderstanding.
We're supposed to have Allied air cover,
and we don't get it.
German planes are constantly
strafing my troops.
If I may say so, General, I'm afraid
your operations reports are inaccurate.
Report?
Three days ago...
the Krauts took offafter my command car,
ran my ass into a ditch.
My staff has assured me we have complete
air supremavy everywhere in the Mediterranean.
When I complained about lack ofair cover...
you said our troops
were not battle-worthy.
You spoke ofthe, uh...
discredited practice of using air force...
as an alibi for lack of, uh,
success on the ground.
It's bad enough I have to wet-nurse Montgomery.
I don't have to stand for that.
I sincerely apologize for that remark,
whoever made it.
And I promise you one thing, General.
You will see no more German planes.
We were discussing, uh,
air supremacy, Sir Arthur.
Damn door won't open!
All right now,
by God, that's enough!
Get that thing outta here!
Come on, you bastards!
Take a shot at me right in the nose!
Get back in here, George.
We need a corps commander, not a casualty.
How the devil did you
manage to stage that?
I don't know. But if I could find
the Nazi son ofa bitches...
that are flying those things,
I'd give them each a medal.
I can't get over how cold
it gets in the desert.
Awfully cold, sir.
Rommel's out there somewhere
waiting for me.
Yes, sir.
You know, if I had my way...
I'd send that genius son ofa bitch...
an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter-
a challenge in two stanzas to meet me
out there alone in the desert.
I'll deliver it.
Rommel in his tank, and me in mine.
We'd stop about 20 paces,
we'd get out, we'd shake hands.
Then we'd button up and we'd do battle,
just the two of us.
And that battle would decide
the outcome ofthe war.
It's too bad jousting's gone out ofstyle.
It's like your poetry, General.
It isn't part ofthe 20th century.
Yeah, you're right, Dick.
The world grew up.
Hell ofa shame.
Dick, I want a 24-hour guard
put around this area.
Ifwe don't, the damn Arabs will dig 'em up
just to get their clothes.
Yes, sir.
Our graves aren't going to disappear
like everybody else's who fought here.
The Greeks, the Romans,
the Carthaginians.
God, how I hate the 20th century.
Captain Steiger reporting, General.
Come with me, Steiger.
Field Marshal Rommel...
I hope you are feeling better...
Captain Steiger has been assigned
to research General Patton.
Very well. What do you have for me?
General Patton comes from
a military family.
His grandfather was a hero
ofthe American Civil War.
He was educated at the
Virginia Military Institute and West Point.
You're not telling me anything
about the man.
He writes poetry and believes
in reincarnation.
He's one ofthe richest officers
in the American Army.
He prays on his knees,
but curses like a stable boy.
He has one standing order.
"Always take the offensive, never dig in".
In 15 minutes we meet with the Führer.
He will want to know how you plan
to deal with Patton's forces.
I will attack and annihilate him!
Before he does the same to me.
General? General?
- What is it?
- Sir, we intercepted a German radio message.
Rommel's Tenth Panzer
is going to hit us near El Guettar.
Rommel, huh?
All my life...
I've wanted to lead a lot of men
in a desperate battle.
Now I'm going to do it.
Look.
Battalion strength at least.
They haven't spotted our positions yet.
They'll get an education
in about 10 seconds.
Wait'll they get a dose
ofthat artillery fire.
Commence firing.
Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.
What a hell ofa waste
offine infantry.
- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, I can't raise him.
To hell with that, Dick.
Tell him to hit 'em hard on their right flank.
Here's where we hold 'em by the nose
and kick 'em in the ass. Go on!
Put him in my car.
Rommel...
you magnificent bastard,
I read your book!
Captain Richard N.Jenson was a fine boy-
loyal, unselfish and efficient.
I am terribly sorry.
There are no coffins here,
since there is no wood.
We will have a trumpeter
and an honor guard...
but we will not fire the volleys, as it would
make people think an air raid was on.
I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair
in a letter to his mother.
He was a fine man
and a fine officer.
And he had no vices.
I shall miss him a lot.
I can't see the reason
such fine young men get killed.
There are so many battles yet to fight.
Battle-weary but victorious...
American G.I.'s and Tommies
ofthe British Eighth Army...
meet in a joyful Allied victory celebration
at Wadi Akarit in North Africa.
For the first time in this war...
Broadway and Piccadillyjoin hands.
Meanwhile, General Montgomery,
hero of El Alamein...
continues to lead his veteran
and victorious British Eighth Army...
in a relentless drive against
Rommel's vaunted Africa Corps.
It is obvious
that North Africa will soon be lost.
We must now anticipate
the enemy's next move.
I shall expect a staff report within 24 hours.
That will be all.
Steiger, you have said nothing.
I wasn't asked anything.
I'm asking you now.
You think Patton will attack Sardinia?
And why not?
Patton, sir... is a military historian.
He knows that Sicily, not Sardinia,
has always been the key to Italy.
If Patton has his way he will attack
Sicily at Syracuse, as the Athenians did.
Steiger, this is the twentieth century!
But you must understand, sir...
Patton is a sixteenth-century man.
May I read an example?
"On a dark street in New York 1922,
wearing white tie and tails...
"... Patton saw three men pushing
a young girl into the back ofa truck.
"He leaped out of his car,
produced a revolver...
"... and forced the men at gunpoint
to release the girl".
It turned out that the girl was the
fiancée ofone ofthe men.
They were merely helping
her into the truck.
What could be more revealing?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don Quixote encounters six merchants
ofToledo and saves Dulcinea's virtue!
Who the devil is Dulcinea?
Don't you see, sir?
Patton is a romantic warrior
lost in contemporary times.
The secret of Patton is the past.
He'll urge an attack on Sicily
because that's what the Athenians did!
General Bradley's done a tremendousjob
with Second Corps.
He's moved into Bizerte
and taken over 41,000 prisoners.
- Good. Very good.
- You're not surprised, are you, General?
After all, you trained that outfit.
- Uh, excuse me, General.
- Hmm?
Sir, this is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.
- Who says so?
- G-2, sir.
Are they telling me that
when we took on Tenth Panzer...
Rommel was in Berlin
with an earache?
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.
G-2 also reports that Hitler
probably retained Rommel in Berlin...
'cause things were going badly
for the Africa Corps.
He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.
Well, I'm my favorite general...
and I don't like to be told
that some second-stringer is up against me.
Then I lose face.
Who the hell are you anyway?
General, this is Lieutenant Colonel Codman,
your new aide.
Oh, yes, Codman. I pulled your name
offthe list because I knowyour family.
Well, I'm glad you did, sir.
Codman, Rommel is the best the Krauts have,
and I kicked the hell out of him.
Now my own G-2 section is trying to tell me
he wasn't even there.
But, General, he undoubtedly
planned the German battle.
Ifyou defeat Rommel's plan,
you've defeated Rommel.
Isn't that true, sir?
Codman...
I want you to have
a drink with me tonight.
Yes, sir.
I have a plan for the invasion ofSicily...
and I want to make sure
I get it approved.
You can help me.
I wanna give a dinner
for General Alexander...
get to him before Montgomery does.
This'll be strictly a formal affair, Codman,
but, uh, purely social.
- By that, I mean, um, purely political.
- Yes, sir.
I want the finest food, the best wine available.
Everything comme il faut.
Oh, thankyou.
George, this is a really splendid wine.
Thankyou.
Thankyou.
Sir Harold, I think it was, uh, Alcibiades
in the Peloponnesian War...
uh, 415 B.C.
He said, "IfSiracusa falls, all Sicily falls.
And then, Italy. "
He knew, you see, that Syracuse
was thejugular ofthe island...
and old Alcibiades
always went for the throat.
I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.
- How's it going?
- I think the old man has 'em in his pocket.
Now, according to my plan...
General Montgomery will land here.
I'll hit the beaches here, take Palermo.
Monty will drive north
along the coast road.
I'll come due east, take Messina,
and cut offthe German escape route.
Yes. It looks like
an interesting plan, George.
Well, gentlemen, uh,
to the conquest of, uh, Sicily.
- Well, to the conquest ofSicily.
- To Sicily.
You know, George, you'd have made
a great marshal for Napoleon...
ifyou'd lived in the 18th century.
Oh, but I did, Sir Harold.
I did.
Morning.
Is General Smith in?
- I believe he's in the lavatory, sir.
- Thank you.
- Ah! There you are, Beetle.
- Monty.
Beetle, I've been giving a good bit
ofthought to the Sicily operation.
- Yes?
- I, uh- I assume we're alone?
You know, Georgie Patton's
already discussed his plan with Alexander.
I realize that, but I have
an idea that his plan...
may lead to an absolute disaster.
Oh?
Beetle, look.
This is Sicily.
Now then, according to Patton's plan...
I would attack Syracuse here...
and he would attack Palermo up here.
Now, obviously,
our forces would be divided.
And,just as obviously,
they could be chopped up piecemeal.
Now then, what I propose,
and what I shall insist on, by the way...
is this.
I will land at Syracuse as planned...
but the Americans-
the Americans will land here at Gela.
I will advance north to Messina...
with the Americans
protecting my flank.
After all, Messina is the key.
It's the reason for invading Sicily.
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?
That the final plans
for the invasion ofSicily...
should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.
George, I've bad news foryou
about your Sicily plan, I'm afraid.
Ike has turned it down.
He feels that since the Italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time...
and since the German resistance is stiffening,
our forces shouldn't be divided.
- Well, uh, where do my people land, then?
- In the GulfofGela.
What for?
There's nothing there but a beach.
Yes, but it puts you in a good position
to support Montgomery.
And, uh, where does Montgomery land?
Well, he'll land in Syracuse and drive north
to Catania, possibly even Messina.
And you'll be alongside
protecting his left.
I see.
In other words,
we get the burden again...
while good old Monty
gets the glory, huh?
Ike had to consider all points ofview.
He made his decision
not as an American, but as an Ally.
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.
You know, I've been
in the army 30 years.
When I get an order,
I say, "Yes, sir"...
and I do my damnedest to carry it out.
But this is what happens...
when your commander stops being
an American and starts being an Ally.
Here's the gangster
Patton, landing at Gela with his Seventh Army.
This film was captured after the landing.
I didn't realize he was so tall.
Over six feet.
He's constantly giving
personal commands.
Obviously they now have two prima donnas
in Sicily... Montgomery and Patton!
There's another three-star general.
General Bradley... Commander
ofthe American II Corps.
He looks like a common soldier.
He is most capable, yet unpretentious.
Unusual for a general.
Sorry...
I don't think I've made myselfclear, sir.
It's true, Montgomery's met the toughest
resistance ofthe campaign there at Catania.
- However, ifwe're requi-
- Perfectly clear.
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.
Yes, sir, but this order
from General Alexander...
directing you to give up the Vizzini-Caltagirone
Road and turn it over to Montgomery.
And then old Bradley will have to slug-
slug, mind you-
his way up the center ofthe island...
over those tough
mountain roads, won't he?
- Yes, sir.
- Messina, Bell.
Messina!
That's the heart of it.
Ifthey'd followed my plan,
I'd be there by now.
I'd cut offthe retreat ofevery goddamn
German and Italian on this island!
Fine. Now you know what I'm gonna do?
First, I'm gonna go to Palermo.
And I'm still gonna beat that limey son ofa bitch
to Messina if it's the last thing I do!
Hey, what's all this talk about taking
the Vizzini Road away from Second Corps?
General Alexander's orders.
The road goes to Montgomery.
No, that road was assigned to me.
How can I get up north without it?
Now, you know the terrain up there.
I'm sorry, Brad, but Monty's run
into tough opposition. Very tough.
Now, you wouldn't be taking advantage
ofthis situation, would you, George?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well, without that road...
yourwhole army, except for my Second Corps,
would be out ofa job.
Free foryou to go into Palermo
ifyou felt like it.
Who said anything about Palermo?
I can read a map.
Does Alexander know that
you pushed out this far?
That's a reconnaissance in force.
George, are you telling me...
that I've got to slug it out over
those mountains with heavy resistance...
just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?
General, I just follow my orders...
like the simple old soldier I am.
General Bradley.
Sir, uh, General Alexander's
heard we're moving west.
He says here: "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.
Repeat: Stop immediately. "
That's what you think it says.
I think it was garbled
in transmission.
Ask them to retransmit the message,
and take your time about it.
That'll take halfa day at least.
Yes, sir.
Well, Brad...
where were we?
We were talking about
a simple, old soldier.
Look at that, gentlemen.
Compared to war...
all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.
Let's go, Sergeant.
Move out.
Give me that helmet, Segovich.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
What silly son ofa bitch
is in charge ofthis operation?
I don't know,
but they oughta hang him.
- Afternoon, Padre.
- General, these gentlemen are here from the States...
looking over our program
for the spiritual welfare ofthe men.
Good. Stick with us,
we'll take you right into Palermo.
Colonel Davis showed us
around your quarters, General Patton...
and I was interested
to see a Bible byyour bed.
You actually find time to read it?
I sure do.
Every goddamned day.
Sir, the Americans have taken Palermo!
Damn!
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo.
Damn!
Palermo's the most
conquered city in history.
First, the Phoenicians,
the Romans, Carthaginians...
the Byzantines.
Then came the Arabs,
Spaniards, Neapolitans.
Now comes the American Army.
This is from General Alexander, sir...
reminding you that
you are not to take Palermo.
Send him a message, Cod.
Ask him if he wants me to give it back.
All right, let me askyou
a question for a change.
You'vejust come from Washington.
How do they feel about
our boys taking Palermo?
Well, sir, the general impression
is that your Seventh Army...
barreled through token resistance...
while Montgomery faced
the brunt ofthe fighting.
My God, don't they know we took on
the Herman Gehring division?
Toughest outfit in the German Army.
Well, the people at home
are interested in you, General.
- They're curious about your
pearl-handled revolvers. - They're ivory.
Only a pimp from a cheap New Orleans
whorehouse would carry a pearl-handled pistol.
- What about your language, General?
- Well, when I want it to stick...
I give it to them loud and dirty.
- Then they'll remember it.
- What do your troops feel about that, General?
Damn it, I don't want these men to love me.
I want 'em to fight for me.
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret weapon
here in Sicily- General Bradley.
The "G.I. General. "
That's what Ernie calls him.
Omar Bradley's no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.
What's your feeling about Montgomery?
He's the best general the English have...
but he seems a little more concerned...
with not losing a battle
than he does about winning one.
He's not aggressive enough.
Is that correct?
Look, boys, I've been gettin'
into a lot oftrouble lately.
Yesterday, the inspector general's
office told me...
my Italian prisoners
didn't have enough latrines.
Hell, they didn't know
what a damn latrine was till I showed 'em.
If I've said anything a little too critical
of my distinguished British colleague...
let'sjust, uh,
forget all about it, huh?
I will tell you one thing,
though, offthe record.
I'm gonna beat
that gentleman to Messina.
Ah, Freddy. Do you realize what
this madman Patton is saying?
He's going to save our skins
by taking Messina!
Well, this report might interest you, sir.
Here I am in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria as well as the Germans...
while he's taking Palermo
without opposition and getting all the glory.
Ah! Well.
Now he's up against three good Jerry divisions,
and he's stuck for a change.
He's not going to get Messina.
That is reserved for
the British Eighth Army and me.
It's time for a move, Lucian. Terry Allen's
First Division is bogged down east ofTorina.
You're bogged down on the coast road.
What we need is another end run
just to break things loose.
Ah, Lucian.
How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.
- Uh, come in. Come in.
We need another one ofyour,
uh, amphibious specialties.
Lucian, I want you
to send a reinforced battalion by sea...
to make a landing up here at Brolo
behind the Kraut lines.
General Bradley says you want me
to tie this in with a land-based attack.
That's right. I want a coordinated attack
the morning ofthe 11 th.
I don't think we can make
the linkup by the 11 th.
- Hell, it's only 15-20 miles. - General, my
boys have been fighting and dying foryards.
Mm-hmm. Maybe you better
kick a few butts ifyou have to.
Lucian, I recommended you foryour D.S.M.
and your last promotion.
I know what you can do
when you put your mind to it.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, but I can't do the impossible.
Well, you're too old an athlete...
to think that you can postpone a match
that's already been scheduled.
You're an old athlete yourself, sir.
You know matches sometimes are postponed.
George. George, if Lucian's right
and we can't back him up by land...
our end run could be a disaster.
Now, those men might get caught up
there on the beach and cut to pieces.
- What's the matter with you two?
- All we're talking about...
is not rushing in until we're ready.
- Give him an extra day.
- Just one more day.
The landing is on.
We're going to Messina.
We're gonna get there
before Montgomery does.
What's so important about that?
General Truscott...
ifyour conscience will not permit you
to conduct this operation...
I'll relieve you
and find somebody who can.
General, it's your privilege
to relieve me...
anytime you want to.
Well, this match will not be postponed.
You have any questions?
No, sir.
You're a very good man, Lucian...
but you wanna guard
against being too conservative.
Rememberwhat
Frederick the Great said:
"L'audace! L'audace!
Toujours I'audace!"
Go on, have a drink.
Excuse me, sir. I won't be drinking
for the next couple ofdays.
Ifanything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.
Well, you're not going, so forget about it.
You believe Truscott's right, hmm?
No.
But I do know that you're gambling
with the lives ofthose boys...
just so you can beat
Montgomery into Messina.
And ifyou pull it off, you're a big hero.
But ifyou don't...
what happens to them,
the ordinary combat soldier?
He doesn't share in your dreams of glory.
He's stuck here.
He's stuck living out every day, day to day,
with death tugging at his elbow.
There's one big difference
between you and me, George.
I do thisjob because
I've been trained to do it.
You do it because...
you love it.
Those men on the beach
are really catching hell, General.
Truscott's men are doing their best.
We have no replacements for him.
He can't break through to the coast.
I'm going down there myself.
Colonel!
How in the hell did he get over there?
What the hell are you waiting for?
Looking for a place to ford, General.
I sent out a patrol to reconnoiter.
I've already done that!
Right down there!
This sewer's no more
than three feet deep.
Now, you get that outfit cranked up,
oryou're gonna be out ofa job!
- And put that helmet on!
- Yes, sir!
Move it! Let's go!
- What's holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.
Planes!
Come on! Move it!
Pull up over there.
What's going on here?
- Sir, it's these mules!
- Jackasses!
You let a whole column get stalled and strafed
on account ofa couple ofjackasses?
What the hell's the matter with you?
No. No.
Now dump 'em over the side
and clear this bridge!
The reason we're pinned down, General,
is we can't get any air support!
The hell with that!
Nobody's getting any air support.
Ifyou can't put some fire into this battalion,
Colonel, I'll get somebody who can!
- Major! You the executive officer here?
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name?
- Walker, sir.
Well, you're now
the commanding officer.
You got four hours to break through
that beachhead down there.
Ifyou don't make it by then,
I'll fire you!
Colonel, there are 50,000 men on this island
who'd like to shoot that son ofa bitch.
Take me home.
Please take me home.
Take me home.
Please take me home.
Take me home.
Please take me home. Take me home.
Please take me home.
There he goes, Old Blood and Guts.
Yeah, our blood, his guts.
Hi. How are you, son?
Where you from, uh, Gomez?
California, sir.
Me too.
Where were you hit?
In the chest, sir.
Well, this might be
interesting to you...
but the last German I saw
didn't have any chest.
Didn't have any head either.
You get well quickly, son.
What's the matter with you?
I-
I guess I just can't take it, sir.
What did you say?
It's my nerves, sir. I-
I- I just can't stand
the shelling anymore.
Your nerves?
Why, hell, you'rejust
a goddamned coward.
Shut up!
I won't have a yellow bastard
sitting here crying...
in front ofthese brave men
who've been wounded in battle.
Shut up!
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
There's nothing wrong with him.
I won't have sons of bitches
who are afraid to fight...
stinking up this place of honor!
You're going back to the front,
my friend.
You may get shot,
and you may get killed...
but you're going up
to the fighting.
Either that, or I'm going to stand you up
in front ofa firing squad.
I ought to shoot you myself,
you goddamn whimpering bastard.
Get him out of here!
Send him up to the front!
You hear me?
You goddamn coward!
I won't have cowards in my army.
I had to kick a few butts
up there, but, uh...
Truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach.
Have you seen the casualty lists?
Yes, I've seen 'em.
What's the word from the coast road?
Well, the Third Division is east of Brolo
heading toward Messina.
Good. Let's get dressed and get over there.
I wanna go in with the troops.
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.
General Bradley,
it's time to consider...
just how many casualties we'd have...
ifwe were still down there
crawling along that goddamn road.
Forward march!
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.
It's a pity, because I shaved
very close this morning...
in preparation for
getting smacked byyou.
Forward march!
You wanted to see me, George?
Got a letter here from Ike.
I, uh, was rereading
Caesar's Commentaries last night.
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe
to distinguish him from his men.
I was struck by that fact because-
"Despicable. "
That's the first time in my life...
anybody ever applied that word to me.
Well, uh, at least it's a personal reprimand.
It's not official.
The man was yellow. He should have
been tried for cowardice and shot.
My God, have they forgotten about all the
people who have taken a hell ofa lot worse...
than a little kick in the pants?
I ruffled his pride a little bit.
What's that compared to war?
Two weeks ago, when we took Palermo,
they called me a hero.
Said I was the greatest general
since Stonewall Jackson.
And now, they draw cartoons
about you. Hmm.
Dirty bastard.
They got me holding a little G.I. there
and kicking him with an iron boot.
You see that? What's on my boot?
A swastika!
On my boot!
An iron boot with a swastika on it!
"You will apologize to
the soldieryou slapped...
"to all doctors and nurses who were present
in the tent at the time...
"to every patient in the tent
who can be reached...
"and, last but not least,
to the Seventh Army as a whole...
through individual units
one at a time. "
God, I feel low.
Oh, God, thou art my God.
Early will I seek thee.
My soul thirsteth for thee.
My flesh longeth for thee
in a dry and thirsty land.
So as I have seen thee
in the sanctuary...
my soul followeth hard after thee.
But those that seek
my soul to destroy it...
shall go into the lower parts
ofthe earth.
They shall fall by the sword.
They shall be apportioned for foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in God.
Everyone that sweareth
by him shall glory.
But the mouth ofthem
that speak lies...
shall be stopped.
Ten-hut!
At ease.
I thought I would stand up here
and let you people see...
if I am as big a son ofa bitch
as some ofyou think I am.
I assure you, I had no intention...
of being either harsh or cruel
in my treatment...
ofthe soldier in question.
My sole purpose was
to try to restore in him...
some appreciation of
his obligations as a man...
and as a soldier.
Ifone can shame a coward,
I felt...
one might help him
to regain his self-respect.
This was on my mind.
Now, I freely admit
that my method was wrong...
but I hope you can
understand my motive...
and will accept this explanation...
and this...
apology.
- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!
Good evening, General. Just want to make
a report on a private poll I've been taking.
- Mmm? What poll?
- The fan mail.
11 % con, 89% pro.
And that 11 % of protest in most cases
is both obscene and anonymous.
But the pro letters are mostly
from relatives and servicemen.
"I want you to know that we are proud
our son is serving in your army.
"From the newspaper accounts, we are
not clear exactly what you did and why...
"but we want you to know
we are foryou.
Keep going, and God bless you. "
Keep going, huh?
Where?
I thought you might like
a sip ofwine, General. It's New Year's.
You didn't celebrate at all last night.
I'm sick ofsitting around
this royal doghouse.
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.
Well, maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio messagejust came in.
Cod, I've been relieved.
They've relieved me from
command ofthe Seventh Army.
I don't believe it.
Happy New Year.
Just a minute, sir.
Since they're sure to
give you another command...
isn't it logical that
they'd relieve you here first?
You mean command of
all the American troops going into Europe?
It's a possibility. I- I know it's been
discussed from time to time.
Well, the logic of it is so obvious,
it couldn't mean anything else.
Sir, I'm going to open
this bottle ofwine.
No, Sir Cod.
But ifyou find a bottle ofcognac
and open it, I'll help you drink it.
Howyou feeling tonight, General?
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
- Get me some writing paper, will you, George?
- Yes, sir.
Your wife ever give you
the devil for not writing?
All the time, sir.
Only I don't write as often as you do.
Don't seem to get around to it.
Lucky thing for us
we've got 'em, huh?
Who wants to marry a couple of
broken-down old horse cavalrymen?
That's what my wife says to me
every time I come home, sir.
What are you doing up so late, George?
Just thought you might like a nice hot bath
or a glass of milk or something.
I got a sleeping pill from the doc, sir,
just in case you might need it.
Sleeping pill?
What's going on here, anyway?
We all heard the news tonight, sir.
They announced it on the radio.
- What news?
- About General Bradley, sir.
How they gave him the top
American command for the invasion.
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Well, I- Well, I just thought...
you might be feeling kind of low, sir.
Yourwritin' things
are here on the desk, sir.
Yeah, uh, thankyou, George.
One little dogface. One measly little slap.
That's what done it.
Oh, George...
I wish I'd kissed the son ofa bitch.
He's paying tribute to the Free French forces
under De Gaulle and Leclerc.
Also to the brave men
and women ofthe Resistance...
who risk their lives every day
to help destroy the Germans.
"France will be free again.
I give you my word. "
'Just as Free French troops
landed here in Corsica...
"to liberate the birthplace of Napoleon...
I will someday land in France to help
liberate the birthplace of Lafayette. "
General, the reporters
would like a word with you.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- General.
General Patton, can you tell us something
about the purpose ofthis visit to Corsica?
I was ordered here
by General Eisenhower.
It was reported that you wrote
the mother ofthe boy you slapped saying:
"The yellow rat should have been shot. "
- Is that true, General?
- No comment.
Sir, I understand General Alexander...
suggested that you take over
General Mark Clark's Italian campaign...
but the War Department killed that
because ofthe slapping incident.
- No comment.
- Can you tell us where you're going, sir?
General Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta,
but that's offthe record.
- Interview concluded.
- You plan on slapping any soldiers there, General?
Ja?
Malta?
Yes, sir.
Malta as a base...
...then southern Greece.
That is possible.
Get me Field Marshal Keitel.
In 1528, these forts were defended...
by 400 knights of Malta...
and 800 mercenaries...
against a force of, uh, 40,000 Turks.
Oh, uh, Codman?
- Still no word from General Eisenhower?
- No, sir.
Not even any response about those, uh,
two turkeys I sent him for Christmas?
No, sir.
Uh, go ahead, gentlemen.
Take a closer look foryourselves.
Well, it looks as ifyou boys
have hitched your wagon...
to a falling star.
Pass the word.
Ifanybody wants out, I'll understand.
Sir, I can speak for the entire staff.
We wanna stay with you
no matter what dutyyou're assigned to.
Up in London, they're planning
the invasion of Europe.
That's what I've trained
my whole mind, body and spirit for.
What in God's name am I doing here?
All right.
Let's get on to Cairo...
see ifthe pyramids are still standing.
There is only
one reason for him to be in Cairo.
To confer with the Greek and
Yugoslav governments in exile.
Let the Italians garrison Italy,
it's their country.
We'll need our German troops to
reinforce Crete and the Greek coast...
...if Patton strikes from Egypt!
I have some new information, sir.
Patton is under severe criticism.
He may even be court-martialed.
He slapped an enlisted man.
You believe their newspapers?
Would they sacrifice their best commander
because he slapped a soldier?
- This place is for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, sir.
Whoever found it has a genius
for cloak-and-dagger.
Who picked this cathouse?
I believe it was General Smith, sir.
He did it to spite me,
the son ofa bitch.
- Welcome to London, Georgie.
- Beetle. How are you?
- Is Ike here?
- He asked me to greet you. Would you excuse us, please?
First, let me put you straight about Ike.
We hear a lot about
you criticizing his decisions.
Nah, not really.
Beetle, you know me. I'mjust an old fool.
Sometimes, I do wonder
whether he isn't a limey at heart.
George, this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history.
Ike sits at the top trying
to hold it together...
and lick the Germans
at the same time.
- Now, believe me, it's one hell ofa job.
- I appreciate that.
Now, we have an important
assignment foryou...
- in connection with the Normandy invasion.
- Good.
Now, I've studied the Overlord plan,
and it has a number offlaws in it...
not the least ofwhich is its dependency
on Monty taking Caen by D-day.
He'll never make it.
Now, I've drawn up an alternate plan...
which calls for a landing in Calais,
following an air bombardment-
Please, will you just
listen for a change?
Remember, Ike stood byyou
when everyone, and I mean everyone...
wanted Patton
with a rope around his neck.
We're going to let it leak out
that you are here undercover...
that you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais.
We hope to pin down
the German 15th Army there...
so they can't be used
against us at Normandy.
Is that all you people
think I'm good for?
We're going to build an army
of 12 divisions around you...
all fictitious, ofcourse.
Dummy troop concentrations,
dummy landing craft...
simulated radio traffic.
You see, the Germans are convinced that you
are going to lead the main invasion effort.
Their agents will spot you here before long.
Then we can move you...
to your new headquarters
at Knutsford.
- What do I do there?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Frankly, George, you're on probation.
Ifyou take my advice,
you'll behave yourself.
Remember, yourworst enemy
is your own big mouth.
Look at this nasty-faced
son ofa bitch, Codman.
Bred for combat. I'm gonna call him William
for William the Conqueror.
- General, maybe you ought to leave him in the car.
- Nah, it's all right.
- Good afternoon, ladies.
- Good afternoon.
Watch this, Cod.
- General, he'll kill that dog.
- Nah, I'll hold him.
I'm terribly sorry, General.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?
That's quite all right, madam.
This way, sir.
Your name isn't William.
It's Willy.
My dear friends,
General George S. Patton,Jr...
has accepted our invitation
to say a few words to you...
on the occasion of
this inaugural ceremony.
General Patton is not here
in an official capacity...
and I have assured him most earnestly...
that nothing he says will be quoted.
May I present General Patton.
- Remember, sir, watch your language.
- Mmm, yeah.
Uh, my dear ladies...
until today, my only
experience at welcoming...
has been to welcome
Germans and Italians...
to the infernal regions.
At this, I have been quite successful...
since the troops which
I've had the honor to command...
have, to date, killed or captured...
some 170,000 ofour enemies.
I feel that such clubs as these...
are ofvery real value...
because I believe,
with Mr. Bernard Shaw...
that the British and the Americans
are two peoples...
separated by a common language.
And since it is the evident destiny
ofthe British and Americans...
to rule the world...
the better we know each other,
the better we will do it.
The Russians.
Don't forget the Russians.
I think that a club like this
is an ideal place...
for promoting mutual understanding...
because, uh, as soon as our soldiers...
meet and get to know
the English ladies...
and, uh, write home
and tell ourwomen...
just how lovelyyou-you truly are...
then the sooner the American ladies
will getjealous...
and force this war
to a quick termination.
And then I will get a chance
to go to the Pacific...
and kill Japanese.
In cities all over the nation,
mass meetings are held...
to protest
General George Patton's statement...
that Britain and America
will rule the postwar world...
that Russia will have nothing to say.
Congressional leaders like
Senator Claiborn Foss are quick to react.
This man has insulted
our Russian allies...
implying Anglo-American world rule.
In my opinion,
he should be severely disciplined.
No, no, Beetle.
This time, I didn't do a damn thing.
They promised me there wouldn't
be any reporters there.
All I did was make
a few remarks offthe record.
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.
You wouldn't listen.
Don't you realize how suspicious
the Russians are ofthe British and ourselves?
I was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies.
Ifthere'd been any Russians there,
I would have mentioned them.
I don't like the sons of bitches, but I would
have mentioned them out of politeness!
Beetle, I don't know anything about politics.
You know that.
I have no political ambitions
after the war.
All I want to do is to
command an army in combat.
Well, it's out ofour hands now.
Ike sent a message last night
to the chiefofstaff.
So now it's up to
General Marshal to decide...
whetheryou, uh, stay here as a decoy,
or he sends you home.
Well, he's a good man.
At least he's a fair man.
I'll let it sit with him.
George, our war is over.
Over, sir?
It'sjust a question of
waiting for the orders now.
I feel I...
am destined to achieve
some great thing.
What, I don't know.
But this last incident is so...
trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect...
that it can't be the result
ofan accident.
It has to be the work ofGod.
Yes, sir.
The last great opportunity ofa lifetime,
an entire world at war...
and I'm left out of it?
No, sir.
God will not permit this to happen!
I am going to be allowed
to fulfill my destiny!
His will be done.
In the greatest
amphibious operation ever attempted...
a pre-dawn naval bombardment
prepares the way...
for Allied soldiers to assault
the Normandy beaches...
and claw out a desperate foothold
on the continent of Europe.
I knew Montgomery couldn't take
Caen on D-Day or "D" plus 10.
And I said so. And here they are
all hung up in the hedgerow country.
What they should do now is pivot the way
von Schlieffen planned it in the First World War.
Then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running.
But they don't listen to me.
What a way to enter
the continent of Europe, huh?
Along with all the rest
ofthe spare parts.
Sir, evertyhing on this plane
is high priority.
General Bradley wouldn't send foryou
unless he had something in mind.
Well, I'll tell ya, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.
If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
I'm gonna play the game.
- If I forget, you remind me.
- I'll give you a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.
- Yes, sir.
General.
Welcome to France, sir.
- I hope the war's still on, Hansen. Where's the boss?
- Right this way, sir.
- Patton. Haven't seen you since Messina.
- General, how are you?
I hearyou're doing a splendid job
decoying theJerries.
Well, you'll forgive me.
I'm offfor the front.
Best ofevertyhing, old boy.
By the way, intelligence confirms
that I am against Rommel again.
Rommel.
Hi, how are ya, George?
- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.
Well, my, my.
Isn't this plush?
Looks like you're, uh,
bucking for archbishop.
Well, Chet Hansen had this rig
built for me. Sit down.
Ike wanted me to talk to you. I told him
that you and I could level with each other.
That's right.
We're going to make Third Army operational
as soon as I can take over 12th Army Group.
Do I get it?
I'll be honest with you.
I've had reservations.
And you've been my senior
ever since I left the academy.
You were the boss in North Africa and Sicily,
and I just thought, uh...
well, it might be a problem
for the both of us.
Well, it wouldn't bother me.
There's one other thing.
I don't want to hit this one too hard, but...
we're different kinds of people, George.
You're right, Brad.
Goddamn it, you're always right.
With your brains and my screwy ideas, we make
a wonderful team. We proved that in Sicily.
I tell you the truth, if I'd been your senior
in Sicily, I would have relieved you.
Brad...
I'd crawl on my belly
to get a command.
For God's sake,
you've gotta get me in this fight.
Only way I can get out ofthe doghouse
is to do something spectacular.
I gotta get back in the war.
My God, Hitler's own people
tried to kill him a couple ofdays ago.
First thing you know,
it'll all be over, and-
I'll... keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.
I give you my word.
George...
I've been working on
a plan called Cobra.
I'd like to know
what you think of it.
Now, we've been slugging our way
through hedgerow country halfan acre a day...
and we've got to find
a way to break out.
I wanna use this road.
The Saint-Lo-Pierres Road.
We'll let Monty pin down
the enemy forces at Caen.
We'll pulverize an area three and a
half miles wide with saturation bombing.
And then seven divisions'll
follow through.
The Third Army will swing around here,
a sweeping end run...
right across France.
What do you think?
I thinkyou need
a screwball old horse cavalryman...
to command Third Army.
George...
Ike came to that conclusion...
in London three months ago.
He what?
Why, that dirty son ofa-
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I promised to keep my mouth shut.
What's this activity near Coutances?
Enemy armored forces driving
through our defenses at Lessay.
"American tanks moving rapidly,
slicing through to the rear areas".
This sounds like Patton, Field Marshal.
Patton is in England.
Do we know this?
The landing in Normandy is
merely a diversionary maneuver.
The real invasion will come
at Calais and Patton will lead it.
The Führer says that the Fifteenth Army
is not to be moved to Normandy.
Those men are sitting on the beach at
Calais throwing pebbles at each other...
...while our men are being
slaughtered in Normandy.
The Fifteenth Army is waiting for
Patton at Calais and he will land there.
You seem perfectly willing to
accept this nonsense,Jodl.
Why?
Because I am not prepared
to dispute the Führer.
You'd think George would at least have
the courtesy to let us know where he's going.
- Good God. Look at that.
- Where ya goin', General?
Berlin. I'm gonna personally shoot
that paperhangin' son ofa bitch!
Now, hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it! Hey, this place
isn't even on the map.
You know why?
We've run clear offthe map.
Give George a headline,
and he's good for another 30 miles.
- Atten-hut!
- All right. Hold it!
All right, now, look. Let's pay attention.
We're gonna clean this mess up right now.
Let's move this vehicle out this way,
this one out this way.
Back that thing up there.
And we'll take this one here.
All right, get up offyour ass.
Let's go, now!
That's it.
That's the way to move. Good boy.
All right, come on. Come on, now.
Here we go! Come on! That's it.
That's it. Gun it!
Gun that thing!
Okay, come on.
Watch it.
Go, go, go!
Come on. Hold it up. Come on, baby.
Yeah, yeah, come on!
That's it.
Come on, now.
- Chet.
- Yeah. Will do.
Come on! Keep comin'.
Keep comin'. Hold it up there.
Now, come on.
Hold it. Hey, dummy!
Hold the friggin' tank!
Hey!
That's it.
Come on. Good boy.
- Hold it up there.
- General.
- General Bradley wants to have a word with ya. Down there.
- All right. Okay.
Come on!
Okay. Hold it up!
Take over.
George, you'd make
a good traffic cop.
George, this drive to the Seine
has been absolutely magnificent.
- But I'm sorry to say, I'm gonna have to slowyou down.
- What the hell for?
Well, for the time being,
we're gonna have to cut offyour supplies.
Gasoline, ammunition, evertyhing.
SHAEF is up against a new set of priorities.
- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Oh, now, take it easy, George.
There are serious issues
involved here, political issues.
By God, it is Montgomery.
The launching sites for the V-2 bombs
are all in his area.
Mr. Churchill wants
those rocket bases destroyed.
Hitler's killing more civilians in London
than he is soldiers in the field.
They expect Montgomery
to do anything about it?
You give me that gasoline, and I'll gain
ground with it. I'll kill Germans too.
- Give me 400,000 gallons, I'll go to Berlin.
- George, I can't do it.
Brad, the Siegfried line
is an empty shell.
They've stripped all the equipment
and sent it to the eastern front.
It's overgrown and crawling with cows.
I could punch through it in two days.
Now, there's no use arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.
Ifyou won't let me kill the enemy,
why did you pick me to command?
I didn't pickyou!
Ike picked you.
George, you have
performed brilliantly.
You are loyal, dedicated. You're one
ofthe best field commanders I've got.
But you don't know when to shut up, George.
You're a pain in the neck.
I have a lot offaults, Brad...
but ingratitude isn't one of'em.
I owe you a lot.
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.
What I can't stand about Monty
is he won't admit it.
Captain.
Bailey's run out of gas.
The point tank has run out too.
And there's a Kraut column up ahead.
Yeah, I know.
- Are you in command here, Captain?
- I was in command.
My tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company.
Tanks ran out of gas...
so we had to fight it out.
We started at 11:00 last night.
Finished a couple hours ago.
This morning,
the fighting was hand-to-hand.
I had a dream last night.
In my dream, it came to me...
that right now, the whole Nazi Reich
is mine for the taking.
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.
Now I have precisely
the right instrument...
at precisely the right moment of history...
in exactly the right place.
- The Saar?
- This'll change too very quickly.
Like a planet spinning off
into the universe.
Moment like this won't come again
for a thousand years, and all I need is a...
few miserable gallons of gasoline.
Right now, the weak spot is here.
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.
What about the fortifications
at Verdun and Metz?
Fixed fortifications are monuments...
to the stupidity of man.
Now, when mountain ranges
and oceans can be overcome...
anything built by man
can be overcome.
You know how I'm sure
they're finished out there?
The carts.
They're using carts to move
their wounded and their supplies.
The carts came to me in my dream.
They kept buzzing around in my head.
I couldn't figure it out.
Then I remembered.
That nightmare in the snow.
The endless, agonizing retreat from Moscow.
How cold it was.
They took the wounded and what was left
ofthe supplies and threw 'em in the carts.
Napoleon was finished.
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.
Only the snow.
Look at this, Cod.
I love it.
God help me, I do love it so.
I love it more than my life.
Paris is liberated,
and French troops lead the way.
The Allies march into the historic city
after fouryears of Nazi occupation.
The hard-fighting French
Second Armored Division...
under Major General Jacques Leclerc...
gets a welcome they will never forget...
as they enter their beloved Paris.
In a powerful drive to the north,
British General Montgomery...
cuts offand bypasses the French coastal towns
of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk...
pushing on to capture
the vital Belgian port ofAntwerp.
Meanwhile, the main body of Patton's army,
resupplied now and rolling like a juggernaut...
is slashing toward the Saar.
Nazi resistance appears to be crumbling...
and it seems that nothing can stop our troops
from driving on into the heart ofGermany.
- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.
Brad? Listen, I've got a bridgehead across
the Saar. I'm on my way into Germany.
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot oftrouble up north.
Now listen, I want you to transfer...
1 Oth Armored to Middleton's
Eighth Corps right away.
Now, Brad, you can't do that.
George, now, listen.
I don't have time to argue.
There's a lot ofenemy activity
up around Ardennes.
No. No, I don't know
how serious it is, but...
Ike wants us to meet with
Beetle Smith tomorrow at Verdun.
Be there at 1100.
Yes, sir.
There's absolutely no reason
for us to assume...
that the Germans
are mounting a major offense.
The weather is awful.
Their supplies are low.
The German Army hasn't mounted
a winter attack since Frederick the Great.
Therefore, I believe that's
exactly what they're going to do.
All right. Now, I want you to start
making contingenvy plans...
for pulling out ofour eastward attack,
changing directions 90 degrees...
moving up to Luxembourg.
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.
I want you to plan for
three possible axes ofattack.
From Diekirch due north.
From Arlon to, uh, Bastogne.
From Neufchateau against
the German left flank.
We've identified four German armies.
The Seventh, Fifth Panzer...
Sixth SS Panzer and the Fifteenth.
They've hit us with 26 divisions.
They overran two regiments
ofthe 106th division...
and 7,500 ofour men
were forced to surrender.
But our immediate concern is that
von Rundstedt has the 101 st Airborne...
trapped here at Bastogne.
Bastogne, by the way,
is the key to this entire area.
Ifwe can hold it, we can break up
the entire German offensive.
Ifthey take it,
we're in serious trouble.
Ike wants to know ifanybody can
get up there and relieve the 101 st...
before they're torn to pieces.
I'm afraid there's nothing that
Field Marshal Montgomery can do.
At any rate, not for some weeks.
What about you, George?
I can attack with
three divisions in 48 hours.
Well, I'd give myselfsome leeway
if I were you.
Ike wants a realistic estimate, George.
You're in the middle ofa fight now,
and it's- it's over 100 miles to Bastogne.
My staff's already
working out the details.
Well, frankly,
I don't see how it's possible.
Not in this kind ofweather.
I should've thought you'd
want to fall back and regroup.
Not me, Freddy. I don't like to pay
for the same real estate twice.
But what about your men? You can't pull them
out ofthe line and cart them off 100 miles...
and then expect them
to attack without rest.
I trained these men, Arthur.
They'll do what I tell 'em to do.
Yeah. Perhaps
we hadn't realized...
that you were quite so popular
with your troops, General.
I'm not.
They'll do it because
they're good soldiers...
and because they realize as I do
that we could still lose this war.
Hmm. Then I think I can speak
for Field Marshal Montgomery.
He'd say you're asking
the impossible ofyour men.
Ofcourse he would,
'cause he's never realized...
that that's what
we're in business for.
Sir, General McCauliffe
turned down a German surrender demand.
- Know what he said?
- What?
He said, "Nuts. "
Keep 'em moving, Colonel.
A man that eloquent has to be saved.
This is where it pays off...
the training and the discipline.
No other outfit in the world...
would pull out ofa winter battle,
move 100 miles...
go into a major attack with no rest,
no sleep, no hot food.
God.
God, I'm proud ofthese men.
Sir, von Rundstedt's thrown
another panzer division against Bastogne.
101 st Airborne's
holding on by its fingernails.
Damned air cover's what we need. Ifwe had
24 hours ofdecent weather, we might make it.
General Mason, sir.
Hello, Mace?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.
I want you to cannibalize your antiaircraft
units and turn 'em all into riflemen.
Yes, every damn last
one of'em you can find.
Evening, General.
I just got the weather report for tomorrow.
- More snow.
- There goes our air cover.
Sir, we may have to pull up
and wait for better weather.
There are brave men dying up there.
I'm not going to wait.
Not an hour. Not a minute.
Going to keep moving.
Is that clear?
We're going to attack all night.
We're going to attack tomorrow morning.
Ifwe are not victorious...
let no one come back alive.
You know something, General?
Sometimes, they can't tell
when you're acting and when you're not.
It isn't important for them to know.
It's only important for me to know.
- You wanted to see me, General?
- Oh, yes, Chaplain.
I'm sick and tired ofThird Army
having to fight the Germans...
the Supreme Command, no gasoline,
and now this ungodly weather.
- I want a prayer. A weather prayer.
- A weather prayer, sir?
Yes, let's see ifyou can't get God
working with us on this thing.
Gonna take a pretty thick rug
for that kind of praying.
I don't care if it takes
a flying carpet.
Well, I don't know how this is
gonna be received, General.
Praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man?
Well, I can assure you, sir, because of
my intimate relations with the Almighty...
ifyou write a good prayer,
we'll have good weather.
And I expect that prayer
within an hour.
Yes, sir.
"Almighty and most merciful Father...
"we humbly beseech thee...
"ofthy great goodness...
"to restrain this immoderate weather...
"with which we've had to contend.
"Grant us fair weather for battle.
"Graciously harken to us...
"as soldiers who call upon thee...
"that armed with thy power...
"we may advance
from victory to victory...
"and crush the oppression...
"and wickedness ofour enemies...
"and establish thyjustice...
"among men and nations.
Amen. "
Weather's perfect.
Cod, get me that chaplain.
He stands in good with the Lord,
and I want him decorated.
Hiya, General!
Supported by
medium bombers and fighter bombers...
which fly countless sorties
against German positions...
elements ofthe Third Army,
spearheaded by the Fourth Armored Division...
drive into the besieged city of Bastogne...
to relieve its 18,000 defenders
on the day after Christmas.
During this operation,
Third Army moved farther and faster...
and engaged more divisions
in less time...
than any other army in the history
ofthe United States.
This is the end...
...the end.
Hurry, Steiger. I want evertyhing destroyed.
Papers, maps, evertyhing!
Evertyhing will be destroyed, General,
that I can promise you.
I'll never let the Russians take me!
I'll kill myself, like the Führer!
He, too, will be destroyed.
The absence ofwar will kill him.
The pure warrior...
...a magnificent anachronism...
Excuse me, sir.
General Katkov would like to know...
whetheryou will join him
to drink to the surrender ofGermany.
My compliments to the general.
Please inform him
that I do not care to drink with him...
or any other Russian son ofa bitch.
Sir, I-
I cannot tell the general that.
You tell him that.
Tell him word for word.
The general says he thinks that...
you are a son ofa bitch too.
Okay, I'll drink to that.
One son ofa bitch to another.
General, is it true that
President Roosevelt, before he died...
promised you a combat command
in the Pacific?
Yes, he did.
But now that he's gone...
I don't think there's
much chance ofthat.
Doug MacArthur
doesn't want me out there.
We've been told about these wonder weapons
the Germans were working on.
Long-range rockets,
push-button bombing...
weapons that don't need soldiers.
Wonder weapons?
My God, I don't see the wonder in 'em.
Killing without heroics.
Nothing is glorified. Nothing is reaffirmed.
No heroes, no cowards, no troops.
No generals.
Only those who are left alive...
and those who are left dead.
I'm glad I won't live to see it.
It's been pointed out, General, that you're
still using former Nazis in key positions...
despite the official de-Nazification policy.
Well, if I'm supplied with trained personnel,
I'll get rid ofthe Nazis.
Until then, I'll use the people who can run
the railroads and keep the telephones working.
After all, General, didn't most
ordinary Nazisjoin the party...
in about the same way Americans
become Republicans or Democrats?
Yes, that's about it.
You do agree, don't you, General,
that our national polivy...
should be made by civilians
and not by the military?
Ofcourse I agree.
But the politicians never let us finish.
They always stop short
and leave us with another war to fight.
You thinking about our Russian Allies?
Sir, did you say ifyou found your army
between the Germans and the Russians...
you'd attack in both directions?
No, I never said that.
I never said any such thing.
But I wish I had.
Sir, there's a call on your line
from Supreme Headquarters. General Smith.
- Beetle?
- Ike is furious.
How could you possibly compare the Republicans
and Democrats to the Nazi party?
And this statement that you refuse
to de-Nazify has everybody screaming.
The Russians, the British, everybody.
Well, the hell with
the Mongoloid Russians.
We've given 'em Berlin, we've given 'em Prague,
and God knows what else.
Are we gonna let 'em
dictate policy too?
George, don't be a fool. The war in Europe
is over. Washington dictates policy.
Well, the war shouldn't be over and we should
stop pussyfooting about the goddamn Russians!
We're gonna have to fight 'em
sooner or later anyway!
Why not do it now while
we got the army here to do it with?
Instead ofdisarming these German troops, we
oughta get 'em to help us fight the Bolsheviks!
George, you better shut up.
This line may be tapped!
Well, I don't give a damn if it is.
I'll tell you something, Beetle.
Up until now, we've been
fighting the wrong people.
Look, you and Ike don't have to get involved
ifyou're so damn soft about it.
You leave it to me. In 10 days, I'll have us
at war with those sons of bitches...
and I'll make it look like their fault!
George, you're mad.
You're absolutely out ofyour mind!
Well, I'm no diplomat! I'm a combat soldier.
That's all thesejokers understand.
You get Ike to give me the word, and I'll kick
their behinds back into Russia where they belong!
Shall I call the artist back, sir?
No, the hell with it.
Nobody wants to see
a picture of me. I'm mad.
Don't you know that?
Field Marshal Montgomery,
His Majesty is prepared...
to receive the next
Chiefofthe Imperial General Staff.
Good-bye, Colonel.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, and thankyou.
Thankyou.
Take care ofyourself, Cod.
George.
Well, uh, gentlemen.
All good things must come to an end.
And the best thing
that's happened to me in my life...
has been, uh-
uh, the honor...
and, uh, privilege...
ofcommanding the Third Army.
Good-bye, and God bless you.
Brad, they've, uh, taken
Third Army away from me.
I know. I just thought
we could have dinner together tonight.
Thankyou, Brad. That's damn thoughtful.
I appreciate it.
Right now, I think I'm going
to take Willy for a walk.
George, look out!
After all I've been through...
imagine getting killed by an oxcart.
You know, Brad, there's only one properway
for a professional soldier to die.
That's from the last bullet
ofthe last battle ofthe last war.
At least, the Third Army earned its pay.
In our drive across Europe,
we liberated...
12,000 cities and towns...
inflicted a million and a half
enemy casualties.
I have a feeling that from now on,
just being a good soldier won't mean a thing.
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to be diplomats, administrators.
- You name it.
- God help us.
George, I want to say one thing.
You've done a magnificentjob
here in Europe.
That's right, George. I think that soldier
you slapped back there in Sicily...
did more to win the war
than any other private in the army.
I'll see you for dinner.
6:30?
For over a thousand years...
Roman conquerors
returning from the wars...
enjoyed the honor ofa triumph,
a tumultuous parade.
In the procession came
trumpeters and musicians...
and strange animals from
the conquered territories...
togetherwith carts laden
with treasure and captured armaments.
The conqueror rode
in a triumphal chariot...
the dazed prisoners
walking in chains before him.
Sometimes his children,
robed in white...
stood with him in the chariot
or rode the trace horses.
A slave stood behind the conqueror...
holding a golden crown...
and whispering in his ear a warning...
that all glory is fleeting.
