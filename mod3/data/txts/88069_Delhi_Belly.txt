There's no water.

You get two hours of water every morning.
Yeah, we forgot to put the buckets out.
What do you mean,

Him.
What?
lt was his turn.
Yeah, but you could hear
the water running, right?
All you had to do was get out of bed
and put the buckets out.
lt would have taken you all of thirty seconds.
Yeah. But it was his turn.
Oh my god! l can't believe
you guys live like this.
What are you getting so worked up for?
We'll do it tomorrow.
Because you 're meeting my parents for lunch.
l want you to shave and look presentable.
l'm meeting your parents?
Wear this.
l've told you not to buy me
such expensive stuff.
Just wear it, Tashi.
People judge you by the way you look.
Yeah, l don't hang out with
any of those people.
Listen, l'm not joking, okay Tashi?
You have no idea how pissed l am.

Delicate.
You can work wonders with the right model.
l'm guessing this is some for you -
- and some for me.
Bacche, say cheese.
Man, is nothing sacred?
He doesn't mind. l asked him.
So that pretty young thing
was a waste of your time
and this is worthwhile?
l don't know what that says about you .
That he's a serious journalist.
Yeah. Or a necrophiliac.
Yeah, a gay necrophiliac.
Fucking idiots.
Yours.
Mine.

Listen, l got to file this.

Thanks.
Here's the address.

Oh, you know.
Work.
All work, no play, Tashi...
dull boy.
Give me one.

Let me go.
You want some of this?
200? Rate's gone up.
No, my darling.
Asshole.
Hi.
Oh fuck!
What are you doing,
lying in the dark like that?
l'm sick, man.
l feel poisoned.
Did you see a doctor?
Yeah.
So here's what you need to do.
Just take my scooter.
Why?
Just take it.
Fucker!
Why am l taking your scooter?
Tashi asked me to
drop off this package.
That fucking thing is
still floating around?
Listen if l wasn't sick,
l'd do it.
Sure.
Listen, since you 're
going out in any case,
can you do me a favour?
What?
Bastards!
Bastards.!
This world is full of uncivilized people.
Don't pay them any attention.
Again? From the top?
So, the doctor has to
check for food poisoning.
Good.
Do you mind - l have to
send him a stool sample?
Fuck off.
Patient name?
Nitin Berry.
Mr. Bhatia...
Okay, l'll talk to you later.
Sir...
this is shit.
Thank you .
Sisterfucker.
New car?
Yes.
Very nice! Beauty, great colour.
Thank you , Mr. Jain.
Mr. Tashi, l just wanted to remind you
that the rent is due next week.
l know, Mr. Jain.
Good. Good. Very good.
lt is just that it was
late last month -
- and the month before
that also, that's why.
You said you 'll speak to
Mr. Maharaj about the dancing.
Every night bharatnatyam
on our heads.
Kathak.
See, l spoke to him -
- and he said that he will try
and take his class early.
That was last week.
Really?
Hi.
What's wrong with you ?
Bastard, l'm dying.
Okay. And you ?
Meeting Ritu for a movie.
''Return of Disco Fighter''
Where are my pants?
Okay, just hang on a second -
something l want to talk to you about.
Two things.
l don't know about that Ritu .
That girl, she doesn't
give me a good feeling.
Yeah, she's my girlfriend -
- only supposed to
give me a good feeling.
You 're my witness.
l warned him.
Listen, rent's due next week.
- l'd like to pay it on time this month.
- Sure.
Nitin?
Yeah, l'm not paying rent anymore.
ldiot.
You 're moving out?
No.
You 're not moving out and
you 're not going to pay rent.
How the fuck are you
going to manage that?
Check this out.
What the hell is this?
lt's a naked man lying
on top of a naked woman -
- it's called fucking.
This is Manish, our landlord.
Yeah, the fucking wife-cheater.
And that's Leena.
She's a whore.
No.
l thought she was sucking his dick
because she's really outgoing -
- but a whore you say, my God.
Bastard, if l wasn't sick,
l'd fucking give you one.
How'd you get these?
No, that's the wrong question.
The right question is,
are we going to pay rent anymore?
And the answer is?
No. No more rent.
No more fucking rent.
What are you talking about?
l'm talking about a small
business transaction with our landlord.
He gives us some money and
these pictures don't get to his wife.
You 're going to blackmail him?
lt's not blackmail.
lt's a sign, from God.
Oh, you 're going to blackmail him.
We're living with a criminal.
lt's Nitin Sobhraj.
l'm just the higher moral authority
in Manish's life -
You 're the higher moral authority
in his life?
Yes, yes, and l'm asking
him to mend his evil ways -
- l'm not a benevolent god.
Don't tell me anymore, right -
- because when the cops
come to get you ,
l don't want to be dragged in
as an accessory.
An accessory?
Listen to him using big words.
An earring is an accessory, you choot -
- listen l've been in this business
for two years, nobody gets -
l'm sorry, you 've been in this
business for two years?
Listen, l do all the work -
- you fuckers get to save rent money.
Everybody wins.
And two?
Two? l'm getting married.
Yeah, we know that.
No, getting married next month.
Really, l thought this wasn't happening
till like next year.
Yeah, but then l thought, what difference?
Sooner the better.
Right up till the moment
they chop his head off,
the goat thinks he's going for a walk
in the park.
Bastard, you 're just too negative.
l hate this attitude.
Listen, this is great news.
Come here, give me a hug.
Great news!
Fucker, l was looking for these -
- your ass is like a solar eclipse, man.
Listen she's too hot, l was going to
marry her myself, but you can have her.
She's too sexy, you lucky bastard!
He's moving out.
You 're moving out?
Then why the fuck were you
going on about the rent?
Tashi, you really should shave, baby.
HeIIo? Menaka? Yes -
Tashi? Tashi, get back in there!
l know where it is -
Okay, should l bring Nitin?
l can't believe you !
- Okay, bye.
- Oh, my God, this guy.
Fucking buffoon.
Baby, l've got to go
Look, it's work, l swear
l'll make it up to you , okay?
Just go, Tashi, just go.
Thank you .
Do you see her, right behind me?
Don't look, don't look.
What about her?
That's Kanika Tuli.
l heard she's a lesbo.
Really? Where'd you hear that?
Oh, you know, here and there.
Considering some of the men
l've been with, that doesn't sound half bad.
Oh, come on, don't tell me you 've never
thought about being with a woman.
No! Never!
So, did you see Rajeev yet?
l think he's around.
Nope.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Do you see her? Don't look.
That's Menaka Vashisht.
She's a lesbo.
Really?
So, what's the story?
Story?
Yeah, you know, you called me, gave me
the address, told me to come over -
Yeah, l know - l'm not that drunk. Yet.
l didn't say anything about a story,
l just gave you the address.
So l came here for nothing?
No, to have a drink, have some fun.
Tashi, stop working.
l was in the middle of something -
Couldn't have been that important.
What?
Why'd you pick up the phone then?
l'm glad you 're having fun -
- l'll talk to you tomorrow.
When you 're sober.
Tash, come on.
Lover's spat?
Rajeev, l'm not in the mood
for your bullshit, okay?
So why don't you just leave?
Make me.
Listen, man - l don't know you , okay?
Do you mind?
Yeah. l mind.
What the fuck?
What's your problem, man?
What did you just say?
What the fuck?
- Come on, say it again!
- Guys!
Say it again, come on.
Listen, man, l'm not
looking for trouble, alright?
No, bitch,
trouble's looking for you .
- Should've kept your mouth shut!
- Leave me alone, you bastard!
- Now mind your fucking business!
- You bastard!
- Come here, you , come here -
- You fucking bastard!
You think you can
get away with this -
- nobody messes with
Rajeev Khanna and gets -
Let's go - he has friends.
Fucker.!
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.
Let me see that -
- that doesn't look so good.
l'm fine.
l'm really sorry.
l just wanted you to loosen up,
have a good time -
lt's okay.
What do you mean, loosen up?
No, l didn't mean it like that -
l am loose, okay?
With friends, people who know me -
- people who don't feel the need to
drag me half-way across the city -
- in the middle of the fucking night,
so l can loosen up.
Don't be an asshole.
l apologized.
l was just trying to be nice.
- Where should l drop you off?
- Just - wherever.
Fuck!
Can't believe this guy!
Hey - hey bastard!

Ex-husband, as soon as
the divorce papers show up.
l can't believe he took a shot at me.
Where'd you find him?
Oh, you know. Arranged marriage.
Parents forced me.
Really?
No. He was my boyfriend in school -
- l actually ran away from
home to marry him.
l fought with my parents.
You know how to pick them.
Sitting here with you .
l'm going to get some coffee.
You want some?
You can't just do that. That's not -
Anyone who can afford to stay
at this hotel,
can afford to buy us a cup of coffee -
Cappuccino okay?
What, you do this on a regular basis?
No, just on days
l get shot at by my ex-husband -
- hi, l'm calling from room 509 -

two cappuccinos?
Hold on.
Would you like something to eat?
No, just the coffees, thank you .

Just a little harder!
Excuse us!

Nothing is ours -
