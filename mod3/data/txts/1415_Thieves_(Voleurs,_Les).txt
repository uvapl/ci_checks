<i>Prologue</i>
<i>At first, I didn't know
what the noises were.</i>
<i>Then I heard a scream.</i>
<i>That's when I opened my
eyes.</i>
<i>I was sure it was my mother's
voice.</i>
You two better leave.
The kid's up.
Go back to bed.
Put him down, Mireille.
Come here, Justin.
Come.
Your father has had an accident.
<i>My father wasn't moving.
His face was hidden.</i>
<i>It was like he was dead.</i>
<i>My grandfather squeezed my
hand so tight, it hurt.</i>
<i>My mother made me wear</i>
<i>a suit and tie.</i>
<i>It itched everywhere.
Especially my legs.</i>
<i>My neck too, because my
shirt was too tight.</i>
<i>It smelt like cologne.</i>
<i>Mom said Rose had used too
much and it stank.</i>
Justin, stop that. You're
being noisy.
No, I'm not.
It's annoying. Like someone
banging on the ceiling.
You were noisy too.
It woke me up. I didn't
say anything.
I know.
We had to move the
furniture
and put it up against the wall.
Rose's husband came to help
us.
I'm sick of staying here.
Rose made you hot chocolate.
I want to see my father.
Yes.
Wait here for a moment.
<i>Her eyes were red.
Fortunately she wasn't crying.</i>
<i>My uncle Alex.</i>
<i>I'd seen him once, when
my grandmother was sick.</i>
<i>He almost got in a fight
with my father.</i>
Why did you come? What the hell?
Watch your mouth.
I came because my brother died.
Lots of things separated us,
but he was my brother.
Anyway, I don't care. I just
want to be alone with him.
If you don't mind, of course.
Let's go.
<i>He had on a suit and tie,
like me.</i>
<i>He had a bandage on his eye.</i>
<i>There was no more blood
in his hair.</i>
You're not coming in?
No, I don't know them.
<i>Now that everyone was in
the kitchen</i>
<i>I searched my father's room.</i>
<i>Once when he was in Lyon,
I found a gun.</i>
<i>A Walter P5 with a
cartridge and bullets.</i>
<i>Now was the best time to
take it.</i>
Justin!
Justin!
Thanks.
Yes, I'll have
a beer.
- Where do you live now?
- Same place. Vaise.
Near where I work.
- Are you getting remarried?
- No, why?
Do you like the mountains?
Me?
- Yes.
- Not much of a talker.
- Shall I make the coffee as usual?
- Yes.
Victor likes it strong.
I don't feel well. Can I lie
down?
Drink something.
- No, I'm not thirsty.
- Come on in.
Why did you come, really?
To make Mireille happy?
That idiot had to call you
right away.
I'm surprised you let her.
She didn't even ask my opinion.
She always stood up for you
with Ivan and me.
She likes having people make
up.
The truth is, you never liked
your brother.
- The same old crap.
- It's not crap.
I can read you like a book, Alex.
<i>Rose made white-bread
sandwiches with cheese and cold cuts.</i>
<i>I was the only one to eat
them.</i>
<i>White bread's my favorite.</i>
<i>I pretended I wasn't listening,
</i>
<i>but I heard every word. </i>
I wish it was you instead
of Ivan.
You'd already left us.
It wouldn't have changed much.
Excuse us, we're looking for
Victor Noel's place.
This is it. What do you want?
<i>They put my father in the
coffin.</i>
<i>Then my grandfather went
up for a nap.</i>
<i>My mother and Alex went
for a walk.</i>
<i>The girl who came with Alex
woke up.</i>
<i>She was walking around the
house.</i>
<i>Alex
one year before his brother's death</i>
<i>When I first saw Juliette,
I didn't know she was a girl.</i>
<i>She was dressed like a boy.</i>
Stop!
Stop!
Don't try to get up.
Calm down, Miss!
Use the cuffs.
Calm down.
Talk to me about perfume.
I love buying perfume. Today
I forgot to pay.
I'd have remembered if they'd
let me.
Tell me what you do with it all.
Only if you undo this thing.
I promise I'll keep calm.
I think they dislocated my
shoulder.
And I'll be black and blue
all over.
I have no control. Sometimes I
feel like killing myself.
Can I bum a cigarette?
You've had someone waiting for
an hour.
He was late. Let him wait.
Is that bitch pressing charges?
You can't throw me in jail
for this!
Why not?
Let's start.
"My name is Juliette Fontana."
"I was born on April 7th, 1972
in Vaise."
"I reside in..."
"the Jean Fournier housing
project."
"Number 15."
Fontana. You must know Jimmy.
He's my brother. Why?
I know him too.
But he prefers cars to perfume.
He also forgets to return them.
It runs in the family. Smoking
mustn't help.
- You busted my brother?
- Yes.
Don't cry. Six months is nothing.
So who's the perfume for?
I sell it to the whore on the
docks.
300 a bottle instead of 600.
Life's tough. School's expensive.
I don't have a scholarship.
1500 francs of perfume. I can
refer this to the court.
Then you're a motherfucker.
Let's swap favors.
You know people.
- Who deals in the projects?
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do..
- No, I don't.
But if I did, I wouldn't talk.
It's their business.
Call the D.A. You're at home
here. You call the shots.
What are you writing?
That you're willing to give
the perfume back.
If you agree, sign here.
Now take your stuff and get
lost.
- She can go?
- Yeah, let her.
<i>She left without a word. For
two months, I never thought of her.</i>
So, what do you think?
I'm not into clubs. You're fed
up with dealing cars?
No, I'm branching out.
For laundering money, what's
better than a night club?
You see evil everywhere.
This place is 40 % mine. It's
legit. Check if you want.
I'll redo everything: the dance
floor, the sound system, the lights.
I'll dump the drag queens. I'll
get rock groups.
Real ones. You'll see.
Soon everyone will know the Mic
Mac.
How about a brotherly drink?
Sure. Just a drop. To make
you happy.
We haven't done this in a
while.
- To the future.
- Yeah, right. The future.
I don't understand why you
asked me here.
And I don't understand why
you're suspicious of everything.
I called because I wanted to
see you. It's simple.
Maybe too simple for a cop.
Won't you sit down?
Mireille often asks how you're
doing.
She's not sick of the mountains?
She likes to complain.
How about you?
I'm okay. I'm living alone.
Fabienne got remarried.
But we always got along.
When you get along, you don't
divorce.
- She wanted a kid.
- It's only normal.
These days having kids is crazy.
- It's too risky.
- I don't understand you.
Kids are what life's about.
You're getting worse and worse.
You are you so serious?
Try laughing a little. Loosen
up.
Dress better. You understand?
You never knew how to enjoy life.
Careful...
- You're not young anymore.
- You're right.
You're always right.
You've never had anything to
complain about.
You're a star now.
- What are you talking about?
- Mic Mac, Mic Mac!
Cut the crap. Are you jealous?
- Of your boasting?
- You want us to fight?
It's been 3 or 4 years...
No, it's been 3 years and 9
months.
You can't imagine how exciting
this is!
- Hey there.
- Too cool!
Meet my brother Alex.
Alex, Juliette...
- Can I play some music?
- Consoul is over there.
Not to loud, okay.
You have to give today's kids
a chance.
The kid over there is my partner.
Running a club is his dream.
His sister's too.
I know them.
- I'll leave you to your friends.
- Come on, Alex. Why in such a rush?
Jimmy's an okay guy. He never
killed anyone.
He screwed up a litte, but
he's clean now.
- You have to help ex-cons.
- You're into social work now?
No, I'm into family and friends.
What can I say? Business is
booming.
You keep great company. I'm
happy for you. Congratulations.
You're not happy. You never
are. You can't be.
You're a freak.
Can I be honest? You need to
get laid.
You need to get laid.
Let me fix you up with a girl
here.
What the hell, Ivan?
I don't need you to meet girls!
Don't take it badly.
I always make the first move.
I invite you here.
I leave the door wide open...
- And you slam it in my face.
- Okay, I'll stop by one night.
Alex.
We can kiss goodbye. Brother
to brother.
<i>lvan knew there was nothing</i>
<i>I hated more. Kissing him
made me nauseous.</i>
Alex, take this.
- You missed the baptism.
- Sorry I couldn't come.
Hi.
- Didn't know you were Ivan's brother.
- What's it to you?
Why were you so nice to me?
You could have called the D.A.
Why didn't you?
You don't have to answer. I'm
just curious.
Maybe you were up to something.
- Listen...what's your name?
- You forgot?
I see girls like you everyday.
Shoplifters come a dime a dozen.
What's a name to me?
That's your life?
An endless stream of identical
losers? Sounds deadly.
Leave my life alone. I already
had to endure my brother today.
I have nothing to tell you.
No, one thing.
You're just a two-bit
delinquent.
I figure the prisoners are
crowded enough with top-notch ones.
That's why I let you walk.
Good enough?
Kiss me. Don't worry, no one
can see.
Sorry, you're not my type.
Be a good girls and get out.
Tell my brother that I prefer
pretty women.
Women of the world.
Understand?
You really think your brother
sent me?
You're sick. I'm no whore.
So why are you here?
Too see if a guy like you,
deadened by the rut he's in
can show signs of life.
I don't want to sleep with you.
I hope that's clear.
Funny, because you're hard.
That means nothing.
You feel me up. I react.
It's normal.
<i>I began seeing Juliette
once in a while.</i>
<i>Not loving her did me a
world of good.</i>
<i>I wasn't out to please her
because I didn't feel attached.</i>
<i>We were united by a feeling
of mutual comtempt,</i>
<i>the natural outcome of which
was immense pleasure.</i>
Have you slept with lvan?
Yes, two years ago.
By the way,
does Jimmy ever moonlight at
Ivan's dealership?
Cut it out, Alex. That's their
business.
Tell me something.
If you had evidence against Ivan,
proof about what he does,
would you turn him in?
Could you rat on your own
brother?
Yes. It would be the best day
of my life.
What do you have against him?
He keeps pissing me off.
Like the other day, when he had
to show me his new toy.
The "Mic Mac,"
He had you and Jimmy come
just to bug me.
- We came on our own. You're paranoid.
- No I see things clearly.
Ivan always has to impress me
with his money.
He's only happy
when I see how well he's doing.
He lives his life to get at me.
Does he know we're fucking?
No, why? He never talks about
you.
No, he mentioned you once.
It's wasn't mean. He said you
were a crackpot.
That's typical.
Me, a crackpot...
I'm perfectly methodical and
logical. He's the crackpot.
I hope you agree.
Can we change the subject?
In a month we've never made
love naked.
You're not into that?
I don't enjoy sharing my bed
or feeling a naked body.
A naked body holds no interest
for me.
It's not my thing.
Look at my tatto. You've never
seen it.
Whose Marie?
The only person I admire.
I'd like to be like her.
In what way?
In every way.
She's my role model. Isn't it
good to have one?
When you're young.
Stop acting as if you're old.
You can be such a pain!
I really can't stand youth.
Maybe I don't know what it is.
It's probably meant to be
shared. You can't be young alone.
That's why I was never young.
When I was your age, I didn't
see anyone.
Or rather...no one saw me.
I didn't exist.
<i>One night I went to the Mic Mac.
Fortunately, Ivan wasn't there.</i>
<i>That's when I first saw
Marie.</i>
<i>I knew it was her at once.</i>
<i>Juliette didn't know I was
there. At the coat check,</i>
<i>they kissed and left before
the drag show started.</i>
Come have a drink with us.
Nabil, move your ass!
Make room for the owner's
brother.
- Nice way to treat Arabs.
- I treat you fine.
You think you're Swedish now?
Hey, Sabrina.
- Sit back down!
- Take this.
I'll go prepare.
Why don't I get a bottle on
the house?
You're differnt. You have money.
You can afford one.
I heard you got robbed.
- Took the cops 20 minutes to show up.
- What's that about.
The guys had ten mintues to
rob me blind.
Jimmy.
Who was dancing with your
sister?
Her professor. I never talked to
her.
- Open your bottle.
- The one from Marseille was a widow.
Pick a card.
No, that is not a woman.
<i>I watched my brother's
friends.</i>
<i>They were like my colleagues.
No difference,</i>
<i>just as stupid.</i>
- You're not showering?
- What we do isn't dirty.
How many showers do you take
a day?
Three.
Plus one before and after sex.
All that water's bad for your
skin.
Here's a present.
I guess old habits are hard to
break.
Relax we're done.
It's fun changing hotels.
Like taking trips. Do you get
a deal or is it free?
Mutual favors.
I won't smell like a floozy?
We have to hurry.
- When do we meet again?
- My next day off is Friday.
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.
It'd be fun to try it in a four
star hotel once.
I may have an angle.
But I'd want something in return.
- It's only normal.
- What would it be?
You suck. Nothing's ever free
with you.
Tell me...
Is Marie your friend or your
lover?
Butt out. Don't you ever
mention her.
Sometimes I wonder why I'm with
you. I must be a masochist.
Want to stop seeing me?
You haven't answered.
You remind me of Ivan.
When I was with him, he acted
like you.
Maybe deep down, you're alike.
- Don't ever mention Ivan
- Same goes for Marie.
We'll bury the hatchet and
keep our secrets.
<i>I asked around. Her name
was Marie Leblanc.</i>
<i>She taught graduate
students in Lyon.</i>
<i>She wrote a book. It cost
127 francs.</i>
<i>I didn't buy it. It was
called "Traces." It flopped.</i>
The truth behind this, which
we're all so quick to disavow:
man is not a gentle creature who
retaliates only when attacked.
Part of his instinctive makeup
is a large dose of
aggressiveness.
His neighbor is not only a
potential helper or sexual object,
but an object of temptation.
Man is tempted to satisfy his
need for aggression,
at his neighbor's expense: to
exploit him at work,
to take advantage of him sexually,
to plunder and humiliate him,
to torture him and kill him.
It's then that a dignified
voice admonishes me:
"It is precisely becuase your
neighbor"
"is not worthy of love,"
"and is, in fact, your enemy,"
"that you must love him as
yourself."
<i>For months we respected
the contract.</i>
<i>Juliette and I met
regularly in hotels.</i>
<i>I knew she was seeing
Marie on the side.</i>
<i>Instead of bothering me,
it made her more desirable.</i>
<i>Then I learned my brother
had died.</i>
- Your radio is lousy.
- Turn it off then.
I don't understand why you
came.
You prefer classifying to
understanding.
But people aren't files.
You're pretty hostile.
You know, Alex,
if I hadn't met Ivan,
I'd be in prison or dead.
Jimmy too.
- Stop it.
- I won't.
You ask questions but you
never listen.
Go on, talk. I'm all ears.
Well...
Thanks to Ivan, I could clean
up my life.
You can't imagine.
Jimmy and I were in serious
shit.
So Ivan was a do-gooder.
- He was!
- I'm trilled to hear it.
He was generous. But that's
beyond you.
You're a tightwad. Nothing
but a pen pusher.
Today's my day.
I'm sorry.
I'm confused as hell.
I feel nauseous.
You want me to pull over?
No, I'll be okay.
Why did you buy today's paper?
I always buy the paper. To
keep up on local news.
<i>For four years I hadn't set
foot</i>
<i>in my father's chalet.</i>
<i>A child was watching us
from the window.</i>
<i>It was Ivan's son.</i>
<i>I'd totally forgotten
about him.</i>
You're not coming in?
No, I don't know them.
<i>I managed to see Mireille
alone. As expected she broke down.</i>
He said not to call you. That
you're a cop.
You'd start investigating.
But I told him you'd never
do that.
I preferred to come across as
dumb.
It's been ten years.
I have to put up with so much.
I really envy you.
I wish I'd gone to school.
I married too young.
What can I do now with a kid?
All I can do is shut my mouth.
Even when they bring my
husband home dead.
I have to pretend it's normal.
Butt out, this isn't for women.
Mind your own business.
Dress the corpse and shut up.
What time did they bring him
home?
I don't know.
Around three. Why?
Look.
It happened in a railway yard
last night.
Around 1 a.m. The times
correspond.
Who brought Ivan back?
I know one of them.
Could you identify the others?
Yes.
But I won't.
Let's go. It's getting dark.
Will you stay for dinner? I'd
like that.
Why don't you turn them in?
Becuase it's impossible.
I'd be ashamed to.
So what do I choose, shame
or sorrow?
- I'd say shame, hands down.
- Well, I've chosen sorrow.
You can't understand. You
don't have kids.
The funeral's in two day. Will
you come?
No, I don't think so.
You're having him cremated?
Yeah, no autopsy, no exhumation.
Play it safe.
And the death certificate?
- Heart attack?
- Ruptured aneurysm. It holds water.
But there's a leak. See the
papers?
Screw the papers.
A watchman was killed.
What do you intend to do?
That's all I care to know.
I'll do my duty.
What duty? The duty of a cop?
Or that of a son and brother?
It's a great day for you.
In fact, I'm happy to see
you cornered.
Did you think I'd beg you to
keep quiet? Not at all.
I prefer to leave you free.
Totally free.
Is that all?
Yes.
Should I leave you with Ivan?
- That won't be necessary.
- Whatever.
It's going to snow.
You have to drive. I won't
keep you.
<i>Juliette asked to go to
Marie's. I felt totally alone.</i>
<i>Not alone in the usual way.
Alone like someone who is lost.</i>
When can I see you?
It's over between us.
You scare me. You'd do
anything.
What do you mean by that?
You'd tell your superiors.
Get a nice medal
Don't you realize they
killed someone?
Don't you realize this is
about your brother and mine?
But that's beyond you. You
don't love anyone.
You just want to fuck people
over.
Now you can do that to your
heart's content.
Aren't you cold?
Let's go have a coffee.
- You can spare a minute.
- What for?
I have to tell you something.
Go on, I'm listening.
It's easier over a cup of
coffee.
You have nothing to say. You
want to jerk me around.
That's not true.
Don't dump me now. Believe
it or not, I need you.
That's all I wanted to say.
There's something you don't
know yet.
Last night...
I was with them.
<i>Marie
the same night</i>
Am I bothering you?
You never do. Are you crazy?
Do you want to eat?
I'm not hungry.
I'm not in great shape.
I can tell.
If you want to talk, I'll listen
Or we can drop it, if you prefer.
Or we can do both. Choosing is
such a bore.
I can't talk now.
Come on.
Our project is coming along.
It's taking form.
- You want to see?
- No, I'm not in the mood.
It's up to you.
- Let's drink to happiness.
- Happiness...yeah right.
It's a legitimate goal.
It's good, isn't it?
I know nothing about wine.
Not just wine.
I know nothing about nothing.
You go on about happiness. For
me it's bullshit. A big lie.
Everybody lies.
Even you.
Behind all your smiles, you
wonder why I'm here.
And what I want from you.
Well I don't know.
The truth is, I never did.
You're here. That's all that
matters.
You're too nice! Can't you
see I'm here to hurt you?
- Now you're hurting yourself.
- Stop it!
I shouldn't have come. That's
all.
Just tell me what happened.
Spit it out!
Fucking idiot! Spit it out.
Spit it out!
Open your mouth!
Shit!
You're crazy.
<i>I brought Juliette to a
psychiatrist friend.</i>
<i>She'd closed up on herself
I tried to make her talk.</i>
<i>She wouldn't utter a word.
She'd become docile and mute.</i>
Come sit down.
Relax.
I'm having a hard time with
Heraclitus.
The idea of fire as the origin
of everything isn't easy.
I know it isn't easy, but keep
on trying. It's worth it.
The issue is how to reanimate
ancient knowledge.
How to bring it out of the past.
How to pass it
from generation to generation
without its becoming
a cadaver in the hands of
those who carry it.
How can we keep it vigorous.
As vigorous as Peguy's wild
rabbit.
We'll continue this next time.
Excuse me...
I thought Juliette Fontana
might be here.
How is she doing?
- Who are you?
- Alexandre Noël.
Oh, you're Alex.
Let's go.
We can't stay here.
- She mentioned you.
- I afraid she'll screw up bad.
She needs rest.
She's in a clinic. It's not
serious.
- Will you give me the address?
- I can't.
The doctors want no visitors.
- Let them tell me.
- You don't believe me?
I think you want to keep
her to yourself.
You're mistaken. It's as if
you don't know her.
Juliette is fleeting.
She'd never let herself be
retained.
Not by a teacher, not by a cop.
I want to know where she is,
I'm entitled to.
Imagine if you were me.
It's hard enough imagining
being oneself.
Listen, I'm no philosopher.
Spare me your condescending
ways of beating around the bush.
I'm not impressed.
Making people talk is your
job.
That's where we lock horns.
We have different habits.
What's yours? Screwing your
students, regardless of their sex?
You're becoming aggresive.
Have I hurt you?
Yes. Don't judge my job. You
don't know it.
I like mine as much as you
like yours.
You're right. I'm sorry. A
stupid prejudice on my part.
I guess you're busy to go
have a coffee.
Coffee, no. But why not a
whiskey?
When times are tough, it
helps me get by.
- Want some?
- No, it's too early for me.
No time like the present.
Everyone knows it helps
break the ice.
So I'll come out and say it.
Can the two of us speak frankly?
Openly. Like two rivals in
love with the same person
joining forces because she's
in danger.
We can always try.
Does Juliette mean a lot to
you?
At first...I considered it
a game.
I thought I had it under control,
but it got the better of me.
I will have some.
It's funny. For me it started
as a game too.
We'd see each other after
class.
We'd talk and laugh.
Suddenly, I'd fallen in love.
It seemed ridiculous at my
age.
God, did I hate you.
I mean, a cop of all things!
But I figured you had a
dangerous job
and with a little bit of luck,
you might get killed.
- It's rare.
- But it happens.
Rest assured, it happens
very rarely.
Statistically, I mean. Sorry
to let you down.
I wished nothing of the sort
for you.
- Then it wasn't love.
- I wished things too.
- Like what?
- To sleep with you.
You and Juliette. Us three,
happy together.
I see...A real orgy!
Like in ancient times.
Before Christ was a time of
orgies. Then came love.
Love's less fun.
Probably.
In orgies you give your all.
No more, no less.
In love, it's never enough.
It's always too much or not
enough.
I'm not big on love.
I prefer being on the balls.
Uh, ball.
Sorry. It's the whiskey in
morning.
Don't worry. I'm not fresh out
of a convent.
I'm not a nun. I like having
fun, believe me.
You only like women?
I don't know about women, but
Juliette, for sure.
It was the first time for me.
For her too.
I was married. I even have
children and grandchildren.
- And you?
- I don't have children.
It was my choice. I have no
kids.
Sorry, I don't like talking
about myself.
I better get to work.
It's the Tilleul Clinic. In
Croix Rousse.
Thanks.
I'll walk you out.
Take my number if you need me.
To talk, I mean.
Do you have a pen?
Yes.
It's 72...
40... 45 45.
I don't mean to worry you,
but you asked me to be frank.
Juliette's mixed up in
something shady.
Did she tell you?
No.
You have my word.
Strangely enough, I believe
you.
- You won't tell me more?
- I can't.
Goodbye then.
<i>I told him her whereabouts.
He'd have found out anyway</i>
<i>I shouldn't have mentioned
the clinic. I didn't trust him.</i>
<i>But he was a spider and I
was in his web.</i>
<i>I thought of Juliette's mutilated
mouth, of the things she wouldn't let us take.</i>
- Does this hurt?
- Of course it does.
You have absolutely nothing.
Not even a sprain.
Can I see Juliette or can't I?
She's left.
What do you mean?
You let her leave in such a
state?
She signed her discharge.
She was free to check in and
out. What could I do?
If you couldn't see she was in
danger, change jobs!
I saw a girl very good at
influencing others.
You're living proof. I'm
surprised at you.
You're wrong about me too.
What a diagnostician!
I worry more about you than
her.
That's your specialty. Making
others think they need you.
Listen,
you're in an unbearable
situation.
A cop came by this morning. I
think she left because she's wanted.
Slumming it can be fun, but
things have turned sour.
It's time to drop it.
''Slumming it''.
How can you talk like that?
You were always a moralizer,
but never so arrogant!
You're pathetic.
You've really grow old.
Does sleeping with her make
you feel younger?
She's a loser. A rotten, no-
good stupid bitch.
You're getting just like her.
Bravo. You're finally saying
what you feel.
That's unusual for you.
I makes me happy to see you
angry.
It makes me sad.
I'm still under your influence.
When we were together, we
should have fought.
It would have done us a world
of good.
I never dared.
You neither.
We were...to sensible, too
respetful.
Too well-bred.
It is a pity.
When violence has no outlet
in a couple, it's the end.
I can hit you if you want.
Have you ever wanted to?
Honestly, no.
I have.
Go on.
Don't hold back.
Hello?
- What is it?
- I'm looking for Juliette.
- I know she lives her.
- She's not in.
Regis...
Jimmy! You have company,
come here.
What do you want?
- I called before.
- And I hung up on you.
Wasn't that clear?
I'm her brother. I have
nothing to say.
How did you come here?
By taxi. Why?
It's dangerous at night here.
Nabil!
Come here!
What?
Can you take her home?
Why don't you do it?
Me and her on my motorcycle?
- Do it.
- Pain in the ass.
I'll get my jacket.
Where are we going?
This way is longer.
What do you mean?
I'm having fun. Fun with you.
Fun showing you around, fun...
No,
stop here. I'll get home.
- Stop!
- Sorry, I can't.
Relax. Five minutes more,
five minutes less...
I mean, that's life.
Get it?
Can I ask you a question?
You really teach philosophy?
Yes.
Cool, I wish
you could give me a lesson
now.
A philosophy lesson?
It's because...Juliette
worships you.
I can't just improvise.
I'm listening, just start
teaching.
First, find a subject you
care about.
All I'm interested in is
money.
No philosophy regards money
highly.
Except of course in everyday
life.
Money is negative in politics
too. It's capital.
You know, you're a good
teacher.
We can take it further.
Sorry.
It's even part of our sexuality.
Money takes the form of waste.
Psychoanalysts say it's shit.
It's not shit, they're crazy.
I don't understand how money
figures for you.
There seems to be
a magic to it, linked to the
undgerground, to dealing.
You're better versed than I.
I don't have much experience.
I stole something once.
In a bookstore.
I stole a book. It left a bad
memory. I was caught.
Why would they let you go?
It's their job.
Anything but intoxicating,
believe me.
- Anything but intoxicating?
- Oh yes.
Anything but intoxicating...
Do you want to hear some músic?
<i>Juliette.
six months  before Ivan's death</i>
Can I see what you wrote about
me?
They're just my impressions.
But I see too much of myself
in them.
I wanted to do a portrait
of you.
But I don't know enough about
your life,
so unfortunately, they're
just impressions.
I'd have liked to speak for
you,
without betraying you. Like
a faithful witness
I'll tell you whatever you
want into a tape recorder.
We both sign it, it'll be a
best-seller and we'll be rich.
Split the money 50-50.
It's not that easy. Writing,
I mean.
It's like painting. You just
need a model.
You do paint with other
people's words.
We can always try.
What's to lose?
We'll have a goal. Besides
having sex, we don't do much.
Why do you say that?
You're bored?
Not at all.
I'm learning tons of stuff.
But I'd like us to make
something together.
A book would be great.
You said so.
- It's life that's great.
- That's cold.
I don't think so.
You're inside life.
You can't realize.
And you're not inside life?
Less than you.
It's a question of age.
You have lots of lives before.
you. It's normal.
I'm not complaining. I'm not
unhappy. I'm even happy.
I've never been so happy.
Happier than with a man?
Yes.
It's strange but I think
what I'd always looked for in
a man, I've found in you.
You've had a lot of guys?
I had my share. But I couldn't
know.
I had no idea you existed.
I didn't know...You
weren't in my scheme of things.
- You see?
- No, not at all.
Too bad. You want to go out?
In this heat?
You have a better idea?
Which one do you prefer?
Hermès or Lanvin?
Come on, decide.
I know you hate ties.
Stay out of the sun. You're
all red.
I've been waiting for you.
For an hour.
Can I know why I've been
summoned?
You're such a ham, "summoned"
I just wanted to see you.
I see you every night at the
Mic Mac.
What's the problem?
The Mic Mac is always crowded.
We used to have private talks.
Now we're on our own
and I thought maybe you'd
want to confide in me.
- Something personal?
- What are you getting at?
Pass me the jam.
Thanks.
Look at the thermometer. 75
degrees already.
You'll fry.
<i>Let him pay taxes if he
wants to.</i>
Write him a check.
I spend and if you pay
taxes ...
You'll see with the accounting,
call me.
Have you seen what time is it?
Lousy coffee, it's cold. Is
there anymore?
Yes, hurry up.
We're always late.
Do you know what Ivan wants
with me?
Juliette, come down for a
moment.
Come on, let's go.
Yes, I am.
No, that guy is crazy.
Fifteen percent
Do you think we're stupid?
Juliette.
Ivan finds it real funny.
We have one guy taking 12%.
He's surefire. No risk.
Only if he lowers his
commission.
Tell him we'll discuss it later.
Tell him the higher the score,
the lower his take.
He may play dumb.
Now not, we'll speak later tonight.
Here I am...talk.
I have nothing to say.
You do the talking.
You're a pain, lvan.
Régis, let's go.
Move your ass.
I'm not your slave!
I'll come if I want to. Where?
First, you'll calm down.
Then I'll show you something.
You better not make a stink.
Understand?
It's really easy.
First there's Nabil,
he finds the cars.
Then it's Jimmy,
he specializes in alarms.
He's the best.
He can break any lock.
We brought this car in last
night.
What time was that, Jimmy?
I want her out.
She doesn't belong here.
I'm taking you home.
No, she stays with us.
I don't know what you told her
so I'll tell her myself.
- What the fuck is this?
- I want to keep tabs on her.
She's sleeping with a cop.
It's no accident. What's it
been? Three months?
And it happens to be the cop
that busted you.
My little brother. Now you see?
We have to do something.
Maybe it's no news to you.
With you two anything goes.
I sleep with whomever I want.
With a cop? What nerve!
If I were Jimmy...
Hold on there. You're not me.
No one's me!
I don't know what you're up to.
You're the boss, you decide.
Instead of pussyfooting about,
call the shots.
What can I say?
It's up to you to deal with
your sister.
She's not my employee. Not
my problem.
You're right. No one's you.
But if she keeps seeing Alex,
she'll end up in a garbage dump.
You as well.
If she breaks it off, we'll
forget it.
It's your call.
- Is the BMW ready?
- Except for the plates.
Change them fast.
Come on.
Get off.
- Why here?
- I have stuff to do.
- What?
- Stow it.
Jimmy,
it's all my fault.
Yes.
I know I should have told you.
I bought chicken and melon.
Okay?
Forget it, I'm not hungry.
Did you buy beer?
I'll put it in the fridge.
I know you haven't eaten. Can
I fix you something?
I said I'm fine.
We need to talk.
So you can tell me...
- Tell you what?
- What you're going to do.
It's taken care of. Drop it
okay?
Let me watch my game.
- I knew Ivan trusted us.
- Cut the crap.
He likes everyone.
He only looks out for himself.
He has no one here to take
my place.
He threatened you.
He gave us some hell!
It's normal. He was right to
do it in front of everyone.
He can't fire me. He can't
close up shop to reorganize.
He has a schedule. Delievery
dates. He's stuck.
I'll dump Alex.
Spare me your sleaze.
I'll spare you my sleaze all
right!
You couldn't understand.
You never even fuck.
I have better things to do
than fucking around.
Seeing you,
seeing what you've become
makes me want to puke.
I really disgust you?
Yeah, you really do.
Now let me watch the end of
the game.
Stop!
Calm down.
Come on.
You want to see a movie?
No, no.
No, that's okay, I like it here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm here to see Mr. Noël.
- Your name?
- Juliette Fontana.
Hi.
So how are you doing?
I thought it over. I was
wrong about Alex.
It's not the right time.
I know my brother,
if you ditch him now he'll
take it badly. Stewing over it.
He'll think you're one of us.
He'll try to prove that you
were wrong. That's dangerous.
Alex always had a paranoid
streak.
- You want a drink?
- No thanks.
Cute dress.
Don't stand there, sit down.
Alex is no Casanova.
You must be one of his few
conquests.
That might make him even
meaner.
Who knows? Your fling might
help us compromise him.
Let's play it safe. Keep up
the routine. Keep seeing him.
Understand?
Yes.
- Why are you in here?
- I didn't want to wake you.
- What time is it?
- 6:30.
I have to go home and change.
I'm due in court.
Hotels are too impractical.
You're not fed up?
Fed up with what?
Meeting like theives.
At my brother's, it wouldn't
be easier.
Why not at my place?
No, no.
I couldn't.
Not at a cop's place. Sorry.
Don't stay there.
I hate winter. Waking up in
the dark kills me.
- You want some coffee?
- No, you finish it.
- When's your next training program
- Next week, why?
Why? No reason, just asking.
Don't feel obliged.
No there just annoying.
Listening to the commissioner's
peep talks
about extinguishing the fires
of delinquincy.
I was a cop. I was thrilled
to hear I'd become a fireman!
It's nice seeing you like that.
Why are you looking at me
like that?
You never laughed before.
Three above and five below.
We want five below.
- The coast will be clear?
- Perfect, just some workers.
- I never saw a nightwatchmen.
- Alarms?
Nothing. Just serial numbers
etched on the windows.
You break in, wire them
and we drive off.
Driving is not my job.
It will be this time.
Does your father know? We've
never stolen five before.
Leave him out of this, Fred.
This heist is mine. We do it
my way.
Do whatever you want I work
the garage.
That's what you're father
decided. Discuss it with him.
Why is Juliette,
here?
Why should she be in on it.
- I don't work with girls.
- Time to break new ground.
I bet she wants to join the
team.
Juliette, how about replacing
Fred?
You have a license. You can
drive.
Yeah.
But, I don't have a license.
No problem.
You'll have one by tonight.
I'm leaving.
I'm digusted.
Here's the train track and
the entrance gate.
Just a pad-lock.
A bolt-cutter will do.
My sister is out
All she has to do is drive
the car.
I put her through school to
keep her out of this shit.
Good for you. What are you
saying?
You know how much we get for
a 320 S?
I can have a guy from
Marseille here by tonight.
You and your sister is none
of my business,
but it kills me that you never
ask her opinion.
She's a big girl, let her
decide.
She's smart.
You treat her like a baby.
Right, Juliette?
I'm easy, I do what Jimmy
says.
You're screwing up Ivan,
but you do the deciding.
But if she's in, I'm out.
- So it's you choice, her or me.
- Watch your tone.
Are you threatening me?
You want me to clear out?
I can't let you. You know too
much. Her too.
You heard what Fred said.
I hate saying I'm the boss.
That's vulgar,
be sensible.
Or you'll lose. And so will
she.
Go check out the gate.
Are you okay?
Can't the Germans pay for gas.
There's enough to get to Fred's
garage.
We said Régis goes first.
I say it's Juliette.
Or do the other cars yourself.
Forget it. We'll settle this
later.
Yeah, right.
Ivan!
Is the coast clear, Nabil?
<i>Wait. There's a car parked
near the fence.</i>
<i>-Did you see anyone?
-No. Do I open the gate?</i>
Don't move. Sit still.
I see some guys.
Juliette.
- Where are they?
- You can't see them.
On the other side of the
tracks. Two of them.
You, the guy in the car!
Come out, hands up!
Just keep cool. We're railway
security.
Don't fuck with us, understand?
Juliette,
listen to me.
Get back in the fucking car
and once you're inside
I'll cover you.
I can't.
- Yes you can, trust me.
- I can't!
- The guy ran off
- Help me put Ivan in.
- Not in the trunk.
- But he's dead!
- He may be alive!
- Then do it yourself.
- Okay, don't be an ass.
- Shit!
Hurry, Juliette,
hurry.
I don't want to!
Hurry.
<i>Justin
two days later in the mountains</i>
<i>It was colder than outside.</i>
<i>It was much longer than a
mass.</i>
<i>My grandfather wanted Dad's
body to be burnt.</i>
<i>Fortunately, no one was
crying.</i>
I have to pee. I can't hold
it in.
You want to take a walk?
No, that's okay.
I'd like us to get to know
each other.
I haven't seen you
in ten years.
Don't bother. I hate cops.
Do you know that many?
No, but I don't understand
why you became one.
Dad didn't either. That's what
spoiled everything.
You could have choosen some
other job.
I needed to break away.
Bullshit. You just wanted to
piss everyone off.
How much do you make a month?
11,500.
That's shit.
Can you come? If I go alone,
I'll get bawled out.
You're not bored living here?
No, I'm use to it.
Do you have any friends at
school?
No, they're too young. I prefer
grown-ups.
There's something I don't get.
Where is your ex-wife?
Working. She's a cop too.
We don't live together anymore.
But how are you?
Do you go out with lots of
girls or are you a one-girl guy?
Why do you ask?
To compare you to Dad. He had
lots of women.
It led to fights at home.
It's late, we have to head
back.
Did you hear me?
Your kid's sick. He needs
help.
- How much?
- 60 francs.
Why did you do that?
For fun.
What will you do now?
What do you mean?
I'm going to try to sleep.
Sorry, but...
I'm sick of you kissing me
goodnight.
I'm not a baby anymore.
<i>The next day I went back
to school.</i>
<i>My grandfather drove me,</i>
<i>in his BMW.</i>
<i>He didn't want me taking the
bus. He said he'd pick me up too.</i>
<i>I was happy. It was the
first time he'd done it.</i>
I want to know what happened
with Dad.
I need to know how it happened.
It wasn't an accident.
I don't believe that.
A job that backfired.
Thanks.
See you tonight.
<i>Alex
ten days after Ivan's cremation</i>
<i>Marie came to see me at
the station.</i>
<i>I just nabbed a dealer.
She had to wait over an hour.</i>
- It smells funny.
- It's bleach.
I have my office disinfected
once a month. Sit down.
Would you like some tea,
coffee,
juice or instant soup?
I'm fine thanks.
- It's my 1st time at headquarters.
- No it's not.
This is a police station.
It's Fort Apache here,
from six to nine.
At night, the Indians reign.
I wanted to talk, but this
isn't the best place.
- Can we go to a cafe?
- No, no.
I can't go into the cafes
around here.
I'll be labeled a drunk.
Respect is hard-earned here.
Loitering in cafes doesn't
help.
You have to find the right
distance.
Everyone has his proper place.
At least that's my method.
It's hard to believe you.
If you're so rational,
why were you with Juliette.
- Why did you send me this?
- To keep you informed.
Of the incident in question.
It happened on Feburary 4th
at 1 o'clock.
Juliette took part in it.
What else?
I'm not on that case.
- You must have an idea?
- Sure, I do.
I'll keep it to myself.
You don't trust me?
Why would I?
Do you know Jimmy?
She mentioned her brother,
that's all.
No, that's not all.
You went to see him one night.
On Feburary the 6th.
How do you know?
It's my sector.
I have informers.
What did he tell you?
Nothing, he kicked me out.
I thought he sent you here.
To get some inside information.
You're not playing fair.
Bouncing back from thugs to
cops. And you talk about trust?
I think you've got some nerve.
All I really care about is
Juliette.
I need your help. If you
prefer to kick me out, do so.
Did Juliette call you?
No, no news.
Tell me if she does.
If you do, I'll keep you
posted to. We'll be equals.
That's trust.
Is it yes or no?
So if I hear nothing, you'll
tell me nothing.
It's normal. Fair is fair.
I'm lucid. I don't know books,
but I know people.
People aren't transparent. We
have feelings. I'm here for her.
Because I love Juliette.
Love sure is beautiful.
That's disgusting of you.
Jimmy was right to kick you
out.
At least Juliette and I are
on the same ground.
You're in another stratosphere.
Go back to teaching.
Eric!
Please show her out.
You're becoming a pain,
Sabrina.
Hanging around backstage?
Ivan didn't dump the queens?
What for? Did you see the
crowds they attract?
- Where's Juliette?
- She doesn't come every night.
Two weeks ago she left the
clinic
and now she's vanished.
You're not worried?
She lives her life. She's a
big girl.
I interrogated the shrink.
A guy picked her up.
He looked like you. I doubt
you remember, but it was you.
Okay it was me. So what?
Alex.
What are you after?
You blew your chance.
You could have fingered us before
the cremation. The body was proof.
Now I don't get it.
- what are you up to.?
- Nothing.
I wanted to see how you were
all doing. Juliette and her pals.
We're all fine. Things got
hairy, but it's over.
I was sure you wouldn't bust
us.
I figured if the police found
out about you and Juliette,
it would be bad. A cop banging
an accomplice to murder can
kiss his career goodbye.
Either he's a loser
or a cop on the take.
Great, Jimmy, great.
You've won, maybe we'll meet
again.
Don't say that, Alex.
If I go down, so do you. For
keeping your mouth shut.
You betrayed the police.
That's bad.
Why don't you tell me what
they know?
- Help me out.
- For how much?
We'll work out a deal.
I like you, Jimmy. With you,
things are crystal clear.
But you got it all wrong.
We're both in deep shit, but
the stakes are different.
Just think, I might get fired,
but you'll do twenty years.
Unemployment and prison are
two different things.
I'll stop by some other night.
So where is Juliette?
I hope she's well-hidden,
because she's wanted.
She matches our composite.
Goodbye, Jimmy.
<i>Marie called. She learned
her lesson.</i>
<i>She wanted to talk. I
invited her to dinner.</i>
I got a call from Juliette.
She knows she's wanted.
She's scared to end up like
her father.
Prison scares her. She say's
she'll crack.
She cried and hung up.
- Now you know everything.
- Thanks.
We're about to run out of wine.
I have whisky.
Where's my bag?
- In the closet. You want it?
- No, I've drunk enough.
And the investigation.
It's part of our contract.
On the night of Feburary 4th
only one person was seen: Juliette.
She wasn't identified. They've
sent out a composite photo.
Will they arrest her?
Not necessarily.
Trust Jimmy.
He's smart. He's done his job
well. He's no amateur.
What can he possibly do?
Hole her up somewhere.
It's his job.
Lots of people manage to hide
forever.
I'm amazed. We're talking
about Juliette.
She's in pain. She's your
friend.
She's in danger. You don't seem
to care. You seem to enjoy it.
Keep calm. Don't start up again.
Be realistic.
What can I do?
So what will happen?
If she gets caught, what will
she do? Defend herself.
She'll find an alibi.
She'll say on Feburary 4th,
she was in your bed.
And what will you say?
I wouldn't hesitate.
I'd do anything to save her.
Prejury is risky business.
I'm sure it is.
But I love, Juliette.
I'm sorry. I know it bothers
you.
I hope...
you won't kick me out like
you did the last time.
On the contrary,
I'm happy to have you here.
I never have guests. Too bad
you haven't eaten.
I have to go home now.
- Not yet, I've bought a pie.
- I have to go.
- I'll drive you back.
- No, I'll take a cab.
I'd prefer it.
Where's my bag?
There. I put it in there.
Where's your bathroom?
On your left.
<i>She locked herself in the bath
-room. I had to break the door down</i>
<i>She was unconscious.
She fainted.</i>
<i>She said she was on medication
and shouldn't have drunk so much.</i>
Don't sit there.
Come on, I'll drive you.
<i>Mireille asked me to talk to
him. I didn't know what to say.</i>
<i>He seemed well behaved,
sad and polite.</i>
What are you thinking?
Look, Alex, don't bother.
You might as well know: you
have no right over me.
I don't know what my mother
said,
but I don't think you can
take care of me.
Pops wouldn't want me in
cahoots with a cop!
I can't take your Dad's place.
Your Dad is your Dad. I'm
me.
How much do I owe you?
Why were you two always at
war?
- Says who?
- Pops.
He said you dreamed of busting
Dad.
Is that true?
I don't know where our hate
came from.
It came from somewhere.
You don't trust kids?
What can I say.
Get in.
Can't we go over there?
It started early between him and
me.
We were younger than you.
We fought all night till we
bled. We shared a room.
I bet my father won.
It's normal. He was older and
stronger. He knew it too.
Do you hate me?
I have to.
Oh, it's you.
Am I bothering you?
I called,
but I kept getting the machine.
And you don't go to your
classes anymore.
Have you heard from her?
No.
Has she called you?
No, absolutely nothing.
- Can I come in anyway?
- Of course.
Don't mind the mess.
<i>...My mother remarried
She won't see Jimmy and me.</i>
Fortunately, there's this.
Her voice.
It keeps me strong.
You never go out?
No, I'm working.
I recorded conversations
with Juliette. She told me her
life's story. Parts of it.
Copying them down is hard work.
I holed myself up, but I'm
almost done.
I need to tell you something.
I promised myself I wouldn't.
I'm not doing this for Juliette,
but for you.
For me?
I don't understand. What is it?
Juliette is not in danger.
The police never thought it
was a girl.
That's normal. It's not the
kind of job for girls.
It was night time. She didn't
talk.
They've been looking for a man.
A man with Juliette's face.
They'll be looking for a while.
You can tell Jimmy.
You can party at the Mic Mac,
tonight.
Stop staring at me. It's not
a trap, it's the truth.
I wanted to make you happy.
That's why I told.
Or else, I wouldn't have told
a soul.
Goodbye.
<i>For the next two months,
I had no news from Marie.</i>
<i>I was sleeping well and working
normally. I wasn't in pain.</i>
<i>I was simply coasting along.</i>
<i>I didn't believe in the world.</i>
<i>I never had.</i>
<i>I've always known it was
a bad dream.</i>
<i>A bad dream and nothing else.</i>
You seem in good shape.
How's Juliette doing?
I haven't seen her. We speak
though.
Do you know she's in Marseille?
I'm not surprised, he brother
has friends there.
She decided to stay there.
She's better off without
Jimmy.
Without you, without me...
She must have meet a guy
her age.
Maybe. Nothing better could
happen to her.
She even found a job in a
bookstore.
You're not going on vacation?
No. Why?
I've finished my book.
I won't publish it unless
Juliette agrees.
Am I in it?
A whole chapter. I changed
your name.
How detailed do you get about
me?
It's about your trysts and sex.
She says it was a form of suicide.
Sex as suicide? Nonsense.
Philosophy didn't help her much.
She was never really into it.
She's into nothing. She's sick.
Yes, if you consider sick a
volcano.
You want to read it?
It's huge. No, I don't think
I'm interested.
I was wrong. I thought you
were a control freak.
Write whatever you want. It's
not my business.
Is that why you asked me here?
Yes, also to give you Juliette's
address and phone number.
Juliette...enough with her. Can't
we talk about something else?
Let's have dinner tonight.
Tonight I'm going to the opera.
Would you like to come?
I've never seen an opera in
my life.
It's my favorite passage.
Alone in the dark,
he asks if love exists.
Then he hears an answer coming
from far away.
It's yes. It shouldn't be, but
it is.
I don't believe in love.
But if you do, why are you here?
Why aren't you in Marseille?
Get moving. Go find her.
It'd be bad for her. She's
young.
She needs her freedom.
Freedom. That's a cowardly
response. You just won't fight.
And this complicity you want
us to share.
Two rivals at the Opera. How
pathetic...
- Why did you come?
- I haven't figured out yet.
Do you intend to wait for her
much longer?
I'm not waiting for her, Alex.
She fills my life.
When I go to bed, when I wake
up, she's there.
- You must think I'm crazy.
- A little.
It doesn't matter.
You are what amazes me most
in this
is you.
You've gone through this so
self-assured.
I find it suspect.
I have a goal.
- What's your goal?
- To nab Jimmy.
Why do you hate him so?
I don't like unpunished crimes.
It's a matter of principle.
You had your chance.
I couldn't.
There was my family and
Juliette.
But Jimmy will start over.
Next time he's mine.
I have plenty of time.
I should be going.
<i>Two days later, I learned of
Marie's suicide.</i>
<i>She'd jumped from her window
at ten in the morning.</i>
<i>The day before, she sent me
her manuscript and the tapes.</i>
<i>She'd left me a note.</i>
<i>Alex, in life we never
renounce, we replace.</i>
<i>I don't want to replace,
Juliette.</i>
<i>This is all for you. Do with
it as you please.</i>
Where are the latest books?
Follow me.
Here they are.
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.
<i>She had changed so much,
I stood paralyzed.</i>
<i>I couldn't have mentioned
Marie's death or her manuscript.</i>
<i>Yet that's why I'd come.</i>
<i>Then I suddenly understood.</i>
<i>The papers and the tapes
weren't meant for Juliette.</i>
<i>Marie would have sent them
directly.</i>
<i>They were meant for me and
me alone.</i>
<i>The next day I started
work again.</i>
<i>As usual, I was greeted
by shouts of hatred.</i>
<i>Epílogue</i>
- Don't say that..
- If I don't, no one will.
No one! They fill their
pockets and shut their mouths.
Ivan turned them into bureaucrats.
Five cars a week won't get us
far.
I prefer to set my sights
high.
What are you getting at?
A revolution?
Who's talking revolution? It's
time to sort things out.
You're the boss. You can count
on me for now.
But I can always go to Marseille.
What will you do there?
With no orders or contacts.
You'll be screwed.
Yeah, I'll be screwed. For
the Middle East.
But there's Eastern Europe
now.
Poland, Russia. They want to
buy.
Jeeps go for a fortune there.
<i>They're loaded. Where's the war,
there's money.</i>
<i>It's time to branch out,
Victor.</i>
<i>Luxury cars are dead. The
future is in trucks.</i>
<i>That business you control it,
others</i>
<i>will be subcontractors.</i>
<i>Teams in large cities
with a supervisor ...</i>
What are you doing here?
I can't sleep.
You've delved into my things.
No, I have not delved.
I took your notebooks and
last years schoolbooks.
To show them to Jimmy.
Why did you do that?
To show him my bad grades?
No, not at all.
Let me explain.
Jimmy couldn't go to school.
He has a hard time reading
and writing.
So I decided to help him.
You understand?
Will you two get married?
We never discussed it.
You're not too hot with this
blanket?
Listen mom. Sorry but...
your new perfume is too strong.
Okay, I understand.
I'll go now.
<i>That night, Pops said Jimmy
could stay at the house.</i>
<i>It was too late to drive
back to Lyon.</i>
<i>I knew Jimmy would go into
Mom's room and that she'd let him .</i>
<i>But I didn't hear anything.
I'd fallen asleep.</i>
Pick a card.
Remember it?
Put it back in.
Think about it hard, okay?
- Is this it?
- No.
- Not the king of spades?
- No.
Are you sure?
I'll put the king of spades
on top.
It's on top now, right?
Blow on the deck.
That's it!
The ten of diamonds?
I hate this one.
Can I make it disappear?
Okay.
It's gone.
Did it fly away?
Where to?
What's that?
What did you put in there?
What's that?
- You stole it?
- Yeah, right.
<i>Jimmy was a grown up, but
he wasn't old.</i>
<i>He wasn't lecturing me.</i>
<i>He didn't talk a lot, but I
never got bored with him.</i>
