All is one, and one is all.
Alchemy, which opens the Gate, is truly a nightmare.
Over here.
The research facility has been prepared.
We'll take you to the Cleta headquarters.
First Lieutenant Atlas and Sergeant Raul.
Please escort Professor Crichton and his family there safely.
Hey, what about home?
We're not going home?
Our home has burned down.
We're going to our new home now.
Sorry.
They will understand one day.
Bastards! Dogs of the military!
What are you doing?!
Go to hell!
What about everyone?
They're not coming with us?
Julia, don't look!
What's wrong, Julia?
I had a scary dream.
It's getting late, so go to your bed and sleep.
Okay.
Brother, are you reading a difficult book again?
This is...
Mom and Dad's research records.
It's a secret.
Brother, do you know Alchemy?
I do.
I'll teach it to you one of these days.
Mom and Dad are researching some amazing things.
I know.
It's about obtaining great power, right?
That's not all.
It's how to solve the Truth of this world.
The Truth of this world?
Yes.
Someone who knows the Truth can create a whole new world.
I don't remember seeing this page.
I feel kind of scared...
What's wrong?
It's getting late.
I'll go take a look.
Julia, you stay here.
Brother...
Brother?
Julia, run!
Now!
Happy harvest festival!
Don't scare me like that, Al!
Sorry I took so long, Brother.
I got this for buying the sandwich.
That wasn't me!
That's way too flashy for a party.
Let's go, Al!
Douse the fire!
Hurry!
Transport the injured!
A monster...
He's a monster...
Where are you off to in such a hurry?
Prison uniform? To some fancy dress party, perhaps?
Brother, he's an Alchemist!
Yeah. Careful now, Al!
He's pretty good!
Brother!
Looks like electric attacks don't work on them.
Stop!
What was that... technique...
Brother, you okay?
After him, Al!
But...!
Resistance is futile!
What'd you say?!
Brother, don't
Hey, you! Do you know who I am?
You're a State Alchemist!
A steel automail leg... and right arm!
You're...!
Yeah, that's right!
I'm the Fullmetal Alchemist.
UTW PRESENTS
THE SACRED STAR OF MILOS, PLATEAU OF SORROW
There was an Alchemist in the collective ward?
Yes. He bit his fingers and drew
Transmutation Circles with his blood.
So he was treating the prison as his villa?
The military police have closed off all the main roads.
However, we have yet to find him.
First Lieutenant Hawkeye, prepare a car.
It's already ready.
Yo!
Good day, Colonel Mustang!
What are they doing here?
Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric.
They're both eyewitnesses.
This is way too much destruction.
Melvin Voyager, 26 years old.
He was convicted of robbery and assault four and a half years ago and sentenced to five years in prison, which he was serving.
Convicted four and a half years ago and sentenced to five years?
Yes.
He would've been released on parole in two months.
Just a little longer, and he'd have been free.
He sure has no patience.
Why wasn't such a dangerous criminal placed in an isolated cell
Nobody knew he could use Alchemy, no?
We were eating dinner and listening to the radio.
Then he suddenly bit his own fingers...
What was he doing before he drew the Transmutation Circles with his blood?
He was reading his newspaper, as always.
Look, this rip is way too clean to
have been made during the chaos.
This is an article on the third page of the
evening edition of yesterday's Central Times.
So he cut out this photo.
Julia Crichton...
A Cletan who entered Table City illegally.
Table City?
You know about it, Al?
I think I've heard of it...
It's a city on the border between Cleta and the western part of Amestris.
What the hell? It looks like a balloon.
First Lieutenant, contact the military police at Table City.
Yes, sir.
But why did he quietly stay in prison all this time?
Considering his power, he could've escaped anytime.
What's more, I've never seen those Transmutation Circles before.
So this involves an unknown type of Alchemy?
There's gotta be something behind this.
The train to Table City will depart soon from platform three.
Come on, Al! The train's leaving!
But we don't have tickets
We can deal with that later!
Aozora ni kazashita te
I held my hands up to the blue sky
青空に かざした手
Sukima kara kao wo dasu natsugumo
Between my fingers, I saw the clouds of summer
隙間から顔を出す 夏雲
This'll be our first time visiting the West.
I'm pumped to see what'll we'll find.
Ushiro kara kimi ga yobu
後ろから 君が呼ぶ
I'm sure we'll discover a method to regain our bodies.
Itsumoyori mujaki na egao de boku wo miru
And looked at me with a smile more innocent than usual
いつもより無邪気な笑顔で 僕を見る
Are kara dorekurai no
How much time has passed since then?
あれからどれくらいの
Who's this guy?
The Melvin I know doesn't look like that.
Toki ga tachikizutsuite kita darou
How much pain has its passing inflicted?
時が経ち傷ついてきただろう
Soredemo bokutachi wa arukitsuzukeru no
Nevertheless, we keep on walking
それでも僕たちは 歩き続けるの
Yes, that's right.
He went to Central City to work nine years ago.
Since he left the countryside, his whereabouts have been unknown.
Sagashitsuzukeru no
We keep on searching
探し続けるの
He has no relatives.
Hadashi de kakenukete futari de waraiatta
We ran barefoot and laughed together
裸足で駆け抜けて ふたりで笑いあった
He's the perfect person to use as a false identity.
Chotto dake furimuite
If I look back just for a bit
ちょっとだけ振り向いて
Tooi kioku ni egaita mirai
I see the future depicted in my distant memories
遠い記憶に描いた未来
Brother, Brother!
Look, it's amazing!
Boku no me ni utsuru mono kimi no me ni utsuru mono
The things you see and the things I see
僕の目に映るもの 君の眼に映るもの
Wow!
Are definitely one and the same
きっとそれはひとつだよと
Kaze ga hoho wo naderu
So the wind tells me as it caresses my cheeks
風が頬をなでる
Look, right in front of that mountain.
Yeah.
That's Table City.
What a mysterious city.
Please present your entry permits.
He wants our permits! Now what?
Border cities are such a pain in the ass!
It's not like we're going to Cleta anyway.
What are you entering the city for?
My daughter has just given birth.
Well, congratulations!
They're pretty agile!
Well, I guess that's expected.
They're Cletan spies.
Please present your permits.
I don't have any.
What?!
Let us go on behalf of this.
Th-This is...!
You're a State Alchemist!
That kid is a dog of Amestris?
Please present your permit.
Al!
Surrender, or I'll fire!
Looks like I'll have to deal with some nuisances!
He's a chimera!
How come?!
A- A monster!
I have nothing to do with any of you.
What's he trying to do?
Stop the train! There's a monster on board!
Let's go!
Huh? What?
Emergency stop!
Why are you braking? We're not there yet!
Al, you stop the train!
Alone on your trip, Mr. Chimera?
Automail?
You must be the Fullmetal Alchemist!
It sure is tough being popular.
What do you want?
What?
More nuisances.
What's this?
Al, done yet?
I'm trying!
This is the boiler... the pressure gauge... the coal furnace...
The brake!
What are you doing, Al?!
The Black Bats are here!
It's an emergency! Stop the train!
Who are you?
Out of my way.
He's an Alchemist!
We're here to save you.
Sorry.
It's a trap!
A trap?
What a waste of my time...
Him?!
Found you!
Thank you for coming to me!
It's been a while.
I've been waiting!
Where'd you learn that Transmutation Circle?!
Crap, we've reached the station!
How troublesome can things get?!
We'll crash into the station at this rate!
Al!
The brake...!
Just stop the train no matter what!
We'll crash!
Damn it!
You okay, Al?
Yeah.
He's...!
After him!
The invading Black Bats are heading
southwest from the Table City station!
Them again?
Brother, look!
That escaped convict also seems to be heading in the same direction!
Watch out!
Everybody, run!
Hey, where's that illegal immigrant?
Where's she being held?
I- In the West Dome, a little ways ahead past the central plaza.
We're going there!
The Black Bats are passing through the central plaza!
Their destination is likely the West Dome!
Shit!
This is too much!
Brother!
Bastard...!
He's letting the prisoners out?!
It's the girl in the newspaper!
Julia Crichton!
Julia!
Miranda!
She's with them?!
Don't you interfere!
Stop, escaped convict!
You again?!
Al, after the girl!
Okay!
Al!
Julia!
No! Don't move.
Oh no!
Al!
Hand the girl back!
Who are you?!
None of you want to live anymore?
Take a good look around you.
Unfortunately, this valley is our territory.
Now, hand the girl back.
Let me go!
Don't worry, Julia.
Who are you?
Don't move!
At least let me pick up my head.
Empty?
A- A monster!
You must've delved into the realm of God.
So his soul is fixed onto that armor?!
The Alchemist with you uses automail, right?
Parts of his body were taken from him to the other side, no?
How do you know that?
My parents were Alchemists.
They must've seen the Gate of Truth.
No way...
I inherited this Transmutation Circle from my father.
And this one is from my mother.
My name is Ashley Crichton.
Ashley?
Are you really my brother Ashley?
Sorry, Julia.
For leaving you alone.
Please forgive me.
Damn it, what on Earth is going on?
You must be the Fullmetal Alchemist.
I heard about the situation from Colonel Mustang.
I'm Major Peter Soyuz, in charge of this city.
Where is the path to the bottom of the valley?
You wish to cross the border into Cleta?
That valley is part of Cleta?
The Death Canyon is no place for humans to tread.
I see now.
That balloon-like shape is this valley.
There's nothing but trash, germs, and the shacks of criminals on the valley floor.
What about the people flying in the sky?
They're a terrorist organization aiming to take over this city.
They go by the name of Black Bats.
So you're the one who claimed to be deporting illegal immigrants.
We're pretty close to catching them all, though.
But why would that Alchemist break out of prison to save her?
Isn't that what the Colonel is investigating?
Please be cautious.
Be wary of the Cletan secret police, too.
I'll tell them you said hi!
Who's that?
He's wearing armor!
He's huge.
Is he from Amestris?
He's really scary!
It's all right.
Julia's back!
It's Julia!
You succeeded!
Julia!
You're back safely, Julia.
Welcome back, Julia.
I'm back.
Sorry to worry you all.
Sorry I made everyone worry.
I'm fine now.
Hey, Julia!
Will you come teach at the school again?
Maybe a little later.
But I'll definitely be back.
Mt. Polos and Milos Plateau.
They've been sacred to the
people of Milos since ancient times...
Come in.
Hello, Colonel!
It's you, Winry.
Sorry for bothering you!
This is no place for a civilian to visit.
I'm here to examine Ed's automail.
He said his right arm was feeling a little numb...
But I can't find Ed or Al anywhere...
So I figured they might've been here.
Ed doesn't have many friends, after all.
I'm not his friend.
<i>Plus, he's doing extremely</i>
Huh? No way...
Colonel.
Winry!
Sorry for bothering you, Riza.
What is it, First Lieutenant?
The train from Central sustained
serious damage at the Table City station.
That fool!
What did Ed do?
Colonel, bad news.
Cleta is officially requesting for us to hand over a criminal.
A criminal?
Apparently, there's an individual wanted in Cleta among the people we arrested in Table City.
Do you have a name?
Julia Crichton.
A 16-year-old girl.
So your hideout is in the caves.
Sorry, I know you were trying to save me.
It's fine.
Anyway, I'm glad you're reunited with your brother.
Hey, Julia.
Why does Miranda want to keep this monster here?
Don't say that, Tony.
Don't take his rudeness to heart.
They don't understand the realm of God very well yet.
Don't worry. I'm used to it.
Um... Mr. Al?
I'm Alphonse. Alphonse Elric.
Elric?
The Elric Brothers of Amestris?
You've heard of us?
It didn't take long to come across the name when I was learning about Alchemy.
I see.
Mr. Alphonse, did you really violate the taboo of human transmutation?
Why would you want to know that?
Mom and Dad used to research Alchemy according to the legends.
They say he who opens the Gate and understands Truth will be able to control the power of the land at will.
According to the Legend of Milos, so they say.
Legend of Milos?
Under the ground, there exists a flow of power known as Magma.
Its energy can be absorbed and transformed into great power.
That is the Legend of Milos.
Please tell me!
If you really did violate the taboo of human
transmutation, you must've seen the Gate of Truth.
We simply wanted to see our dead mother again.
Don't do it, Julia.
You will pay dearly for violating the taboo.
Just like us.
We need great power to revive our nation!
Thank you for telling me all this, Mr. Alphonse.
I'll work to get you out of here soon, so wait just a little longer.
This place really stinks.
Hey now, are we seriously dumping
our trash into a neighboring country?
I am Miranda.
Julia has told me about you.
I didn't think we'd meet alive.
Your Alchemy is quite powerful.
The name of Black Bats suits you well.
The lot of you only know how to blindly wander around
the area between the great nations of Cleta and Amestris.
What'd you say?!
Alan.
Indeed, we are bats that cannot survive outside of these caves.
That is exactly why we need great power.
We'd like your help in order to reach the Sacred Land...
He told me everything I needed.
Please set him free.
How'd it go?
It's as you had said.
They only attempted human transmutation
because they wanted to see their dead mother.
Looks like Professor Crichton was right.
The Gate of Truth really does exist.
But he also lost his body because of that.
Looks like opening the Gate of Truth really is quite dangerous.
But we'll be closer to obtaining great power.
How foolish of them to delve into the realm of God.
Why would you say that?!
If I knew how, I'd also want to bring Mom and Dad back
Julia!
You saw him.
Do you really want to end up like him?
I just want Milos to become a peaceful country again.
Come on, please help us!
Have you forgotten how the people at the valley bottom despised us and called us traitors?
It's because of them that we risked our lives to move to Cleta!
I know that.
But why?
If Cleta really did take us in, why did Mom and Dad have to die?
Mom and Dad were murdered by wolf-chimaeras.
They were sent by the Cletan military.
By the time I got there, the wolf-chimaeras had already murdered my parents.
They were turning the lab inside out, searching for something.
They were looking for the book in my hand.
The research paper our parents wrote!
I picked Julia up and ran for our lives.
But the wolf-chimaeras chased us, following our scent.
I realized we couldn't escape, so I put Julia
down by a tree and headed towards the cliff.
I was then surrounded by the Cletan army and fell into the valley depths.
Miraculously, I survived and secretly crossed the border into Amestris.
But they continued to hunt me.
After memorizing all of my parents' research, I committed a crime.
That was because I figured I could hide from them if I managed to get into Amestris' giant prison.
I see...
Then, just when I had thought of rescuing you,
I learned that you had traveled illegally to Amestris instead of staying in Cleta.
I didn't think you'd be used by the people at the valley bottom!
That's not true!
After that, I was caught by the Cletan army.
The military kept interrogating me.
When they realized that I knew nothing,
they threw me straight into the valley depths.
I narrowly survived because the people in the valley saved me.
And now, I work with them because our ideals are one and the same.
Weren't you also in this valley when you were younger
I don't want to bring up the past.
Do you all seek the Alchemy of the Sacred Land, too?
Alchemy is but a means to the end.
We have but one goal:
The independence of Milos.
In terms of numbers and strength, we are absolutely no match for Cleta or Amestris.
There are only two paths we can take.
We can either violate the taboo of human
transmutation and open the Gate of Truth,
or we can retrieve the Alchemy of the Sacred Land.
Either way, we'll obtain the power to control Magma, the great power hidden beneath the ground.
We need a trump card.
What did the professor find out?
Cleta wants this secret as well.
They're definitely setting something up.
Agh...
Urgh...
Yo, did a huge piece of armor fall down here?
What the heck?
Bastard, are you leaving me down here?
Too bad, then.
Al!
Hey, where are you?!
I hope he wasn't scrapped.
I'm sure there's more of you hidden here.
Take me to your leader!
The escaped convict is in the valley?
Yes, he fell down with the girl.
Are you sure that was Julia Crichton?
She looked just like the girl in the photo.
This is bad.
Do you really think Cleta will believe us?
But it's the truth.
What's the fullmetal boy doing?
He went down to the bottom of Cleta Valley.
He said something about saving his little brother.
This is ridiculous!
How dare he...
Something happened to Ed and Al, right?
Riza, where is Table City?
Kudos for being able to live at the bottom of this valley.
Are you with the armored guy?
Yeah.
You're a dog of Amestris?
There's an explanation for this.
We'll definitely take back our Sacred Land.
By "Sacred Land", do you mean Table City?
It's called the Milos Plateau!
Including Mt. Polos of Cleta, this land was
where the people of Milos lived 3,000 years ago.
Why did you lose your Sacred Land?
You don't know?
Cleta took over Milos by force.
You Amestrians then approached us, saying you'd send reinforcements.
The moment we let your army in, the valley became a battlefield and our sacred plateau was taken from us.
That was also when my parents were killed.
That wasn't what I was asking, sheesh.
Gimme just a little more.
PLACEHOLDER
Metal and glass only fetch this much now.
Pedro, is it true that Julia's back?
Yeah, there was a commotion down there not too long ago.
See?!
I'm sorry.
How extraordinary!
What the heck, old man?!
I'm Gonzales.
Where are you from?
Who made this prosthetic?
M- My childhood friend...
Hey, old man!
Old man, you make automail?
Old Gon, I'm not done yet!
Oh! Sorry, sorry.
I'm gonna connect the neurons, so hold him down tightly.
All right, you ready?
Y- Yeah.
Heave!
Old man, you're being too rough!
If he keeps breaking it during rehab, he
won't get up again for the rest of his life.
Pay me when you get the money.
Sorry, Old Gon.
There's a lot of injured people here.
That's because cave-in accidents occur frequently.
Cave-in?
Cleta's trying to build a geothermal plant over there.
The villagers are ordered around like slaves for a meager wage.
That's what you're talking about?
It uses the heat from the volcano behind it.
I see.
And with Amestris on this side...
You guys sure are stuck between a rock and a hard place.
Did that Julia girl really climb that high?
She's a warrior.
She wouldn't be frightened by a mere cliff.
It's the secret police.
What?!
Pedro, over here!
Thanks a lot, old man.
Take good care of your automail.
I will!
They're like cave apartments.
It's right ahead.
I smell him.
What's happening?
Amestris shot down someone who was climbing the cliff.
Climbing up the cliffs just a little is seen as a border crossing.
They set all the rules.
Bastard...
Hey, are you all right?
Hey, Pedro!
May glory... be with Milos...
You've been studying.
I'd bring some back every time I sneaked into Cleta or Amestris.
I see.
But only a very few of them contain useful Alchemy.
You're like Mom.
Well, you're like Dad yourself.
Really?
Your wound...
It must've been tough.
I suppose.
Give me your hands.
Come on.
O- Okay.
Julia, you...
A friend taught it to me.
Although I can't use Mom and Dad's
Alchemy yet, I've remembered just this one.
Sorry you've been through so much hardship.
Brother, do you remember this?
You made this for me.
How do I look?
Take it.
I already have this one, so you should wear the other one.
Hey, come on!
I wanted us to wear the same earring.
I guess something like that did happen.
I'm really happy that I could see you again.
So, if we regain the Sacred Land, let's live here like we used to...
They're here?!
Monsters!
What's happening?
Stop right there!
You just don't give up.
How dare you murder Pedro.
I won't forgive you!
The escaped convict!
Brother!
Al, you're all right!
I didn't think you'd show yourself up.
Julia!
If you behave, then the bystanders won't get hurt.
There it is.
Bottom of the valley.
The large cave in the west.
Send more chimaeras out.
Yes, sir!
So she's not even a friend to any of you?
Al!
Mr. Al!
Just call me Al!
What the hell is that?!
It's a wolf-chimaera.
Yeah, he's of the same type as the one that killed my parents.
He said he followed your scent here.
They'll keep coming as long as you're here.
We should stop using his help, then!
It's too dangerous!
I can leave any time.
But I'm taking Julia with me.
I...
I'll stay here with everyone.
You can't do anything with this bunch!
It's not a question of whether we can.
<i>It's something we must</i>
Julia!
If we cannot open the Gate of Truth, then we must obtain the Alchemy of the Sacred Land.
Once we have it, we'll win for sure!
We just need the Sacred Land's Star of Blood.
Star of Blood?
Monsters!
Two more are heading this way!
See? I told you so.
Everyone, retreat!
Huh, a dead end?!
Dive in!
Damn it, the scent ended!
They escaped?
Seems like they slipped into an
underground river, stopping their scent.
But when did he learn the Alchemy of the Crichtons?
It'd be a waste to kill him.
The excavation project is complete.
All right, move on to the next phase.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think there'd be such a huge lake underground.
You saved us again.
How should I thank you?
Don't worry about it.
We have our own reasons for coming here, too.
We've been investigating all kinds of Alchemy so we can get our original bodies back.
Get your original bodies back?
How will you do that?
We don't know.
But my brother and I decided that we'd regain what we had lost with our own strength.
I see.
I'm a little envious, though.
You and your brother can relate to each other so well.
Al!
Hey, don't leave me behind!
Oh well.
<i>It isd to swim with automail.</i>
Julia!
We're going ahead.
Okay!
Deciding on something together with your brother...
Is the hideout really that deep in?
Yes.
There's an open space just ahead.
This is...
...a cemetery.
A long time ago, this was the home
of tens of thousands of Milos people.
You're saying this is the city of the Milos people?!
That was 400 years ago.
The Cletans forced our ancestors to the bottom of the valley in order to obtain the Stone of Immortality.
The Stone of Immortality?!
Is it a deep crimson stone?
You know of it?
We call it the Philosopher's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone...
Tell me more.
Over here!
Thank you both again.
Edward and Alphonse, thank you for saving Julia.
Where are we?
This is the center of our hideout:
The Realm of Quelled Souls.
Quelled Souls?
This is where the souls of all the people of Milos who dug the valley and died in war rest.
Dug the valley?
What's the meaning of that?
The Sacred Land did not originally have such a deep valley.
Our ancestors built a nation here with the plateau with a view of the holy Mt. Polos as sacred land.
A legend exists, telling of the Stones of Immortality buried around the plateau.
We call them Stars of Blood.
However, upon hearing the legend, the
Cletans mounted a large-scale invasion.
They took our lands and sought after the Stars of Blood.
In the 300 years that'd passed, they continued digging around the Sacred Land, resulting in this giant valley.
We, the people of Milos, were stripped of
our homes and ordered around like slaves.
We don't know how many Stars of Blood were mined during that time.
After the Cletans left, all the people of Milos had left was a deep valley and ruins.
And yet, they still continue to rule over us from above the valley.
When Amestris attacked, the Cletans sent us to the battle frontlines.
Carved here are the names of all
the people of Milos who died then.
After the war ended, we were forced into the bottom of the valley.
To serve as the shield to the border.
No records remain indicating the excavated Stars of Blood were given to the Cletans,
meaning the Stars that had been mined rest somewhere in the Sacred Land.
That is the secret of the Sacred Land.
This relief is the blueprint the Alchemists designed to dig up the Stars of Blood.
Users of Alchemy ended up creating the excuse to
drive the people of Milos to the bottom of the valley.
Alchemy is something that remind us,
the people of the valley, of our painful past.
That's why everyone hated our parents, researchers of the art.
But it's no use to distance ourselves from the past.
In order to create our future, we must climb out of the valley with our own strength.
That is why we need power.
The power of Alchemy, and the great power of the land!
Julia, listen to me.
If the Star of Blood really is the Philosopher's Stone as we call it in Amestris, then its raw material is...
...the lives of living humans.
The lives of... humans?
Yeah.
It couldn't be farther from immortality.
It's forged from the limited lives of many.
The Philosopher's Stone...
...is nothing but a blood-stained rock borne out of desire!
That's... the Sacred Land's...
That's why our parents tried so hard to hide it from the Cletan military.
Our legend of Milos is stained with blood.
How...
How can we...
How can we use something like that?
What have we been working so hard for?
Vatanen!
Julia, don't worry.
Everyone here would gladly give their lives for the freedom of our country.
If the Star of Blood is indeed created from human lives...
...then we should use these lives to create our future!
Wait a minute!
Are you seriously okay with that?!
Ashley, welcome back to the valley depths.
It's incredible you can say that with a straight face.
You're absolutely right.
We must apologize for the contempt we held for your family.
On top of that, we'd like to ask:
Will you and Julia lend us your strength?
Do you have any idea how much blood will be spilled in vain?
It's true that much of our blood has been spilled.
But the blood was not spilled in vain!
Ashley, there are things people would gladly give up their lives for.
Hey, Julia!
Sacrificing the lives of others to realize your own dreams...
Do you really think you can obtain happiness that way?!
I understand what you're saying...
But we have no other choice!
Julia...
Your nation is strong, so you don't have to worry about its ruin.
You don't have to live each day fearing it'll be your last.
But we're different!
We've always been threatened by our powerful neighboring countries fighting over Alchemy.
Getting back our Sacred Land and obtaining the
Stone of Immortality will put an end to this past.
Thank you for your advice.
I know.
But there's no way we can accept that.
Please remember that.
Let's go, Al.
Brother.
Hey, wait!
Let them go.
They do not know where the Star lies.
Julia.
I will make your dream come true.
Let's live in this valley together
after we get the Sacred Land back.
Brother...
What do they mean, "they must"?
They're basically just fighting over the Philosopher's Stone!
But this used to be their territory.
They're willing to sacrifice their lives for it.
That method of thinking will bring them their destruction!
Anyway, we have to confirm this Alchemy they talk about.
Kid.
Old man.
Would you like to give them some flowers?
Huh?
Looks like he was killed by the monster from Cleta.
At least he's fortunate enough to be sent off by his comrades.
I was right next to him, and yet...
Sorry.
Aren't they Amestrians?
Hey, what are you doing here?!
That's right!
Shut up, these two are different!
Sorry, kid.
These are the people who died today.
Tia was injured while collecting trash.
Anita is fortunate enough to be leaving with her children.
And Lucio was shot went he tried to climb the border cliffs.
But everyone's still so young.
This is everyday life in the valley.
Hey, Pedro.
You fought to try and change this situation, didn't you?
Old Gon!
Karina.
Please give this to Julia.
It's a charm I made with Tia.
Oh, I see.
Okay, I'll give it to her.
Thank you.
Look, Brother.
The valley is already pitch-black.
The people of Milos have always been
looking up at the sky from the dark depths.
Yeah.
If this continues, blood will flow in the valley once again.
Alchemy isn't omnipotent.
They can't rely on a great power.
Let's go.
I don't get it.
Get what?
The man passing under the name
of Melvin Voyager is being hunted.
Probably by a Cletan.
Tired of a life of being pursued, he hid himself in a prison.
But why five years?
He could've used Alchemy to escape from prison any time he wanted.
Maybe he needed to conceal himself and wait for five years.
Indeed...
Five years is a long time.
Ed, Al, and I were all innocent kids five years ago.
It's so cruel.
We can't bring back the past.
Indeed.
However, everything starting from right this moment is shaped by ourselves.
Let's hurry.
We can't let those two get there before us.
There's no way that shorty would know about the secret of the Sacred Land.
This is what Cleta wants!
Right before Dad died, he ripped off his skin and gave it to me.
The path to the Star of Blood is right here.
All right, that should do the trick.
I'm done too, Brother.
Let's go investigate the entire city first.
Do you have any leads?
Yeah, there are some things I'm curious about.
The Fullmetal brothers are back in Table City.
They returned not to Central, but here?
They must've found something in the valley.
Wasn't there a blueprint in the underground hideout?
Yeah.
Do you remember there being several towers in Table City?
Yeah, I do.
Don't you think it's strange?
Huh?
They're just digging the valley, so why did they bother recreating the towers on the blueprint?
Now that you mention it...
What's more, they didn't do it for the other buildings.
Just the towers.
The people who made that blueprint must've been
searching for the Philosopher's Stone using some rule.
So, does that rule have to do with the towers?
It's just a hunch.
Look at this.
These are the positions of the towers from the blueprint in the hideout.
And these are the actual positions of the towers.
Look at the southern side of this bisecting line...
There are less towers.
Someone destroyed the towers that once existed.
So is there some meaning behind the destroyed towers?
No, they're concentrating some sort of
power by reducing the number of towers.
Right onto this remaining point on the southern side.
This is our destination.
The vanguard team will go there first and attack the
Amestrian garrison on the opposite side to draw their attention.
This is "Rat Seven", prepared and ready to move out.
Roger.
Is it really okay for us to seek the Star of Blood?
We need its power.
Julia, isn't this the path you showed us?
Yes.
You are an Alchemist.
You have the ability to use the Star.
And you should be proud of that.
That's...
Julia.
Old Gon, why are you here in such a dangerous place?
Lucio and Tia...
I see.
Karina gave this to me.
It's a charm Tia and Karina made together.
They want to you keep it.
Thank you.
That's right.
There's no time to hesitate.
I need the power of the Star to protect the children!
Don't push it.
Brother, this is...
I didn't think we'd come back to a place like this.
It looks like a regular church.
Brother!
There's wind.
I see.
The towers from the era of Milos are covered by Cletan buildings.
And could this be the entrance to another world?
Is this...
...a city from the era of Milos?!
Why is it underground?
It's probably the Cletans' doing.
In the past, the people of Milos forged the Star of Blood here.
After hearing about it, Cleta conquered Table City and sealed it in its entirety.
They wanted to keep the legend's secrets to themselves?
But before they could figure out the secret,
this place was taken over by Amestris, intent on expanding its territory.
It looks like...
...someone from Amestris found out about the secret, too.
The church is just a dummy to disguise the underground entrance.
Which means the secret of the Sacred Land is right ahead.
Huh?
There's nothing here.
So much hype for nothing.
I'm sure this room was built for some special purpose, though.
Brother.
Special purpose, indeed!
Is this a coffin?
Shall we open it?
Heave, ho!
What the hell? It's empty!
What?!
What a pity.
And I was thinking you'd at least solve part of this room's riddle.
Soyuz!
I had this coffin built to catch those useless Alchemists.
So you're the bastard searching for the Philosopher's Stone!
All I know is that there's some secret to this room.
All that's left is to wait for those flies from Milos.
A bastard like you can't possibly make good use of the Philosopher's Stone!
No need to worry.
There are plenty of people in this world who want the Philosopher's Stone.
And they've got plenty of money, too.
Major, we've got trouble!
What?
There's an explosion on the Amestris border!
It's Miranda and her team.
What an impatient bunch.
I'll just wait in anticipation, then.
Take care of them.
Yes, sir!
We should've brought an army division with us.
Who would've thought the valley bottom people would set the stage for their own destruction?
Colonel Herschel, it's ready.
Everyone, attend to your stations.
I repeat. Everyone...
Multiple terrorists are flying over the fire on the other side of the valley!
Calm down! It's a distraction!
Keep your attention here!
What just happened?
It's almost time.
We're counting on you, Miranda.
Just a little more!
We'll get rid of you before the flies arrive.
Can I ask a question?
What?
Are there many other underground chambers like this in Table City?
How regrettable.
Had you been able to solve the city's riddle, you could've seen them all.
I see.
Regrettable, indeed.
How kind of them.
We were ready to welcome them even if they hadn't visited so courteously.
Hey, you hear me, Soyuz?!
We're coming to kick your ass!
What are you doing?! Get rid of them!
Don't let them meet up with those flies!
Major, watchpost four is under attack.
They're here.
The Black Bats are heading for the underground church!
Capture those Alchemists before they get there!
This isn't the only secret chamber!
We can't solve this riddle even if we find them one by one!
Black Bats!
They're not heading underground?!
Julia!
Julia, it's dangerous!
This city's in trouble!
Ed, Al!
This is a trap!
A trap to catch all of you!
Julia!
There's a mechanism in this city!
You mustn't touch it!
Both of you should leave this city quickly!
We will proceed forward for the sake of our future.
Sorry, and thanks for your advice.
If punishment awaits, let it fall onto me.
Hey!
Julia!
Let's go, Al!
We've broken into the watchpost on the west side.
And with that, we've killed all the
infiltrating mice with an explosion.
We'll fly at very low altitudes in the town areas.
We'll use the heat from the fires to rise
straight up and attack the central watchtower.
Why?
Why aren't they going underground?!
The second defensive line has been breached!
They're headed towards this watchtower!
What the hell are the ground troops doing?!
Their men, having infiltrated our troops, are
now causing chaos and halting our movements!
So they intend to hide underground after paralyzing my troops?
What nerve.
Major, we must escape.
There'll be no way out once they reach the stairs!
They're going to attack that tower!
Is the Star of Blood there?
There they are!
Geez, what a pain in the ass!
Major, above you!
How could he...
Don't mind him! Let's go!
Is it here, Ashley?
Yeah.
Where is the path to the Star?
Right here.
Look at this.
What is that?
The voice pipe to relay orders.
Many pipes like this one run throughout the city.
Although it's now being used as a voice pipe, there was another use for it in the past.
Another use for it?
Yes.
That is the secret of the Sacred Land.
Ashley...
What are you doing?
Brother, stop!
Alan!
Why?
This must be done.
What are you talking about?!
Listen, Julia.
A network of voice pipes like this one
was laid out throughout the Sacred Land.
Do you know what'll happen if we spill human blood into it?
Miranda!
Yes, there isn't a single drop of blood in this world that isn't useful.
This is a three-dimensional Transmutation Circle drawn with blood of living humans!
No way...
First Lieutenant Atlas, it's been a long five years.
Good work, Sergeant Raul, for helping me look after Julia in the valley.
What's going on?
He used to be a Cletan soldier.
Right, Sergeant?
This is all for the Star.
We can finally create a nation that won't lose to Cleta or Amestris, First Lieutenant Atlas!
No way...
Alan...
Good work, Sergeant Raul.
First Lieutenant... why?
There isn't quite enough blood yet to complete this Transmutation Circle.
Julia, do you remember me?
I've been waiting for this day to come ever since I eavesdropped on your parents' conversation.
What? Is everything all right?
It all started the moment I was made to guard that filthy family of scholars from the valley!
Atlas?
Officer Atlas!
You lied to us...
Unforgivable!
So you do remember me.
I wanted to test my Alchemy skills...
...so I joined the Cletan army.
But I got fed up of all the politics within the army.
It was then that I met your family.
Your father was an incredible man for
branding his research onto his two children.
But you were still too young then.
Too young to complement Ashley's map.
I've waited so anxiously for five years!
What did you do to my brother?!
I ripped off his skin and placed the map on myself.
You killed... my brother?
What's the point of asking that now?
You... You killed my brother...
You bastard!
Let me take a good look at that map on your body.
Get mad! Get even madder!
That's it, very good.
With this...
With this, the true map has been completed!
That's the secret Mom and Dad left behind?
That's right.
It's the map that'll show where the
Star of Blood will be once it's forged.
I have no use for you now.
Like the rest of them, you can contribute your blood to the Transmutation Circle
Run...
Miranda!
How annoying.
Miranda!
You... must live...
Miranda!
These guys really waste my time.
Bastard, what's the meaning of this?!
You...!
Sorry we took so long.
Al!
And I was thinking you were some powerful Alchemist.
But you're just a little thief!
It's more unfortunate for the Star if it ends up being used by some ignorant tribe!
The Star has been forged.
What?!
There are stairs!
It's fine!
We got this.
The Star is born.
It's time to bury this revolting valley.
A new era shall begin.
Graz, detonate the trenches.
Yes, sir.
The preparations are complete.
What's going on?
What? Did something happen?
What's that?
No way...
What's that?
We didn't plan this!
Damn it, now what?
The Star of Blood.
If we use it...
We can't use that!
That man wants the Star, too!
Indeed.
Both of you, go after him.
I'll block the magma.
Al...
I'll be fine.
I'll leave the valley to you, then.
You can count on me.
Go!
It's him!
Star of Blood...
My Star of Blood!
This is the Star of Blood...
With this, the world will be mine!
Don't even think about it!
I finally have it!
Take this!
Julia!
Damn brats!
I hold the Star. Don't take me lightly!
Smartass!
This is the end!
Ooh, so scary!
That attack again?
Julia!
This is the Star of Blood?
The Star belongs to me!
Julia, take it and go to the surface!
Throw it into the magma! Hurry!
With this, I can save the valley...
Without it, everyone will...
No, Julia!
The Star will devour your soul!
Julia.
Julia!
Hey, can you hear me?!
Give me my Star back!
Give the Star back to me.
What?
Julia...
Dad...
Mom...
Brother...
No!
You killed them all!
Stop, Julia! That's enough!
It's all because of this place...
If this thing didn't exist, people wouldn't have fought...
...and they wouldn't have died!
It's time.
Lieutenant colonel!
I will settle this myself.
Please hold up.
The magma'll reach the village if it advances any further.
Retreat! Retreat!
What's happening?
What the hell is Soyuz doing?
A terrorist?
Colonel!
She's not an enemy!
Fullmetal!
Edward!
Wait for a bit.
Fullmetal, what's the meaning of this?
Colonel, could you give me a hand?
What happened?
Table City has fulfilled its purpose.
Purpose?
The purpose of creating a Philosopher's Stone.
What?!
The escaped convict came here to forge the Stone.
It's all over for me if they find out.
I gotta make it look like the colonel
was killed by the Black Bats!
Son of a bitch!
Arrest him!
Yes, sir!
My valley...
Julia?
I will stop the magma!
Julia, wait!
Colonel!
Ed?
Julia!
You can't be serious...
Ed!
Winry!
Are you okay?
Sorry, my right arm's broken.
Geez, it's because you keep doing crazy things.
Let's do this!
Yeah!
What was that sound?
It came from the armory!
Let's go!
Occupy the explosives bunker!
Free Milos!
Oh no, the gears are broken.
You don't have replacements?
I only brought the tools for adjustment.
Winry, come with me.
Hold on tight!
I'll go too.
Colonel!
Children first!
Children first!
Move forward! Slow and steady!
Hey, Old Gon!
Old Gon, I need a favor!
My arm's broken!
Fool!
The magma's coming! You should be evacuating too!
I can't stop the magma without my arm!
Please, could we have some replacement parts?
Huh?
Could you be...
Please hold up.
Al.
Julia.
I'll stop the magma.
Julia, don't tell me you swallowed the Star of Blood...
I should be able to use the power of the land now.
It's him!
There you are, my Star.
Atlas!
Won't you give it back to me?
Wh-Who the hell are you?
Thank you for forging the Star of Blood.
Do you still remember me, Officer Atlas?
Don't tell me you're...
I am the person whose face you ripped off...
...Ashley Crichton.
Ashley...
I think about what happened that day every passing moment.
After you ripped off my face and the skin over my ribs,
I survived using the Star of Blood my parents hid for their research.
How dare you murder my parents, Atlas!
Damn it, I've come so far...
You can apologize to my parents in the underworld!
Brother...
Are you really my brother Ashley?
Julia, it's been so long.
If you really are my brother, then tell me.
Why didn't you let me know you were still alive?
Forgive me.
It was all so I could kill the man who murdered our parents.
I had the wolf-chimaeras protect you.
Protect me...?
Julia, come with me to Cleta.
Cleta isn't my home!
This is the place I grew up in!
Have you forgotten how the people of
this valley called our parents traitors?!
This valley has no future.
It does!
We'll create one!
We can do it!
You're wasting your time.
I will send an army to bury this valley.
Bury?
What are you saying?
I'll make the Sacred Land mine.
Julia, you and I will continue to create Stars of Blood.
I can't allow that.
Brother! Colonel!
Oh my, it's a commanding officer from Amestris.
Unfortunately for you, the ruins of Milos have been destroyed.
I'll have to thank you for that, then.
The Star's Transmutation Circle is in my head.
I'll simply rebuild it.
Why are you so obsessed over the Star?
What are you trying to do?!
I'll use the Star to open the Gate of Truth.
And a new world no one has ever known will be mine!
The Sacred Land and the Star are merely tools.
The Truth is the only object of value!
Now, Julia.
Come with me and
Enough of your crap!
You want to become God?
The Star you swallowed has consumed your soul.
Become yourself again!
What right does someone who
violated the taboo have to lecture me?
The wall won't hold!
I won't allow the valley to be buried!
Please help me stop the magma!
All right!
Don't even think about it!
Bastard, are you trying to kill your sister?!
What?!
What's wrong?
The magma...
The magma's flowing into the water!
It's coming here fast!
Ed!
Wait, young lady!
Please, stop it!
Get outta the way!
Julia.
Why do you care for this foolish and ugly
world that puts us through so much pain?
Now, come with me.
I won't go.
A mountain of trash it may be, but this world isn't ugly.
To me, you're the one who's foolish and ugly.
Get out of my way!
Is that the power of the Star?
I thought you'd be the only one who'd understand me.
But you're no different from all that trash!
No!
What?!
Julia!
Julia!
Stop, Ashley!
Julia!
Al!
Julia, if you can't understand how I feel...
...then you can go down with this valley!
You're the one who doesn't understand!
How stubborn are you?!
Are you seriously Julia's brother?!
Al!
Seal the spots where the magma's flowing out!
Hurry, or the valley will...!
Al...
Rise!
Sacrificing the lives of others to obtain the Truth...
What enjoyment will you gain?!
Well then...
What about the wars your nation fights?
Foolishly killing over and over again in the name of justice...
There is no worth in a world with people like that.
I'll obtain the Truth and cleanse this world!
You're just trying to run away from reality.
A new world, you say?
The Truth isn't a tool used to destroy reality!
You think you're so smart...!
Al!
I'm fine!
Even if there really is a new world,
it does not result from opening the Gate of Truth.
It exists right beneath your feet!
Bastard...
Do you have any idea what the pain of cruel misfortune is like?!
I can't reach the top!
Julia!
I will recreate...
...this world!
Stop!
Do you not understand the feelings of our parents who
protected the secret of the Sacred Land to their deaths?!
What they were trying to protect wasn't
the Sacred Land, but the people of Milos!
What?
Julia will...
Yeah, they'll both die if this continues.
He's too strong...!
What should I...
Please...
Please!
Julia...
Brother...
Brother!
Julia, now's our chance!
The magma!
If we can't reach it from below,
then we'll reach it from the other side!
From the other side?
Right?
We have no other choice.
Go!
Unbelievable...
What was that?
What's that?!
Mommy, I'm scared!
Don't worry. Everything'll be all right.
Has the magma been stopped?!
We did it...
We stopped it...
Brother...
I won't let you die.
No way...
Julia!
Hey, stop!
Hey, Julia!
Julia, you can't!
Let go of me!
Or Brother will... Brother will...!
The magma stream has been stopped!
They're rebelling!
The people of Milos are invading our base!
What?!
The enemy is retreating!
Charge!
The central gate has been breached!
Where's Colonel Herschel?
There's no response!
We'll have to recapture the Sacred Land all over again?!
All units, retreat for now!
Julia!
Stop!
Brother!
Julia!
Julia!
Hey...
We have to stop her bleeding.
This'll be pretty rough, so hang in there.
Julia, wake up!
Didn't you say so yourself?
You said the people of Milos would climb out of this valley with their own feet!
Julia...
Al, the bleeding stopped.
Ed, Al!
Winry.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for fixing my arm.
I gotta thank Old Gon, too.
Looks like it's best to leave the rest to them.
I hereby announce the creation of the country of Milos!
Today is the very day of our rebirth!
Julia...
You're awake.
Vatanen.
The Cletan army has retreated.
They'll probably be back soon, though.
Amestris has also begun strengthening their army.
I heard about Miranda.
Sorry about that, Julia.
You did well in holding out on your own.
Ashley left.
I... see.
The armored guy left those earrings with us.
You mean Al?
He said it was something you treasured.
How strange.
There should be another one.
Nah, one is enough.
One is enough for me.
Vatanen, we've got plenty of things to do.
The hard part starts now.
Yeah, you're right.
But man, we built something pretty awesome.
Yeah, I'm glad the valley's safe and sound.
It'd be great if the wishes of Julia
and her comrades could be granted.
Well, it's them we're talking about.
They'll definitely fight until it's granted.
Julia!
You shouldn't be walking around with your leg like that.
I wanted to properly thank you both.
Well, it's great that you're all right.
Al, Ed.
Without the two of you, the valley wouldn't have been saved.
Thank you so much for everything.
Julia.
I'll never approve of what you did.
Brother!
We shall continue to carve our path
with what we believe to be the right way.
A path that only we can find.
And one day, we'll come and tell you about it.
Yeah.
But y'know... what was it?
You're good.
Pretty darn good.
Thank you.
Well, see ya.
Al, I'm leaving first.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
You have such a good brother.
It's nothing.
You guys have such a good relationship.
Julia, you seem kind of different.
Oh, this?
I'm not used to it yet.
No, that's not what I meant.
You've...
...gotten prettier.
Thank you.
I think I understand.
I've always thought that I had to obtain power
to do something for the valley and everyone in it.
But in the end, I was simply clinging onto the memories
my parents left behind and the power of the Sacred Land.
I finally understand that after losing so much.
Even so, what I want to protect is definitely here.
That's why I won't regret what I did.
I'll live on here, standing firmly on my own legs.
Julia, it looks like you've obtained something precious.
I guess so.
I'll definitely get my own body back.
After that, I'll come see you again.
Yeah, I'll be waiting.
They sure sent a lot of them here.
The higher-ups are preparing for war.
The enemy is the terrorists within the Cletan border.
What's more, our side has also made
mistakes in dealing with the terrorists.
We can't afford to act lightly.
Which means we should wait and see what Cleta does?
That's all we can do.
By the way, Fullmetal.
That wasn't a human transmutation, was it?
He didn't die.
Julia restored him from the tiny bit of life he had remaining,
using the Star of Blood and her own body.
I see.
Life that has been lost cannot be brought back.
That very truth is what shows us
the meaning and value of living.
Look.
We can no longer see the valley.
