So gentle.
Whatever works.
Jesus.
No.
No! No!
Don't! Leave him alone!
Get off.
You're just screwing everybody, aren't you?
- No.
- You son of a bitch.
That should do it.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
It's all right.
It's all right.
The worst part's over now.
Yeah.
We'll go away.
We'll visit my family.
You'd like my family.
I just love this house.
It's such a classic Victorian.
It was built around 1886,
probably remodeled slightly in the '40s.
I know what you're thinking.
Needs a lot of TLC and it's a little pricier
than what we talked about originally.
But you've got two units downstairs
to help you cover the mortgage.
And I really think, relatively speaking,
we can get this place for a song.
- Up here...
- So, what do you think?
Seven hundred and fifty grand, huh?
That's not a song, it's an opera.
Between my savings and Drake's,
we can cover the down payment.
Realtor said we could get one of those
home equity loans for improvements.
You'll be totally tapped out.
Well, we'll have rental units.
Well, what if you can't rent them?
The vacancy rate in this area
is less than 2 percent.
Look, you want my advice
or my approval?
- Your advice.
- Your approval.
Pass. It's too risky a call.
I mean, if someone misses
one month's rent...
you'll go down like the ritanic.
I don't think you can get approval
for the loan at your income level.
We'll fudge the numbers a little.
Yeah. Everybody does it.
It's expected.
"Legal description of building".
It's a building.
Well, I don't think that's what
they mean. It's like, you know...
It's a wooden building with windows.
All right.
We'll come back to that one.
My previous employment.
Equestrienne.
That's too pompous. Self-employed.
Okay.
"Manner in which title will be held"?
Like this.
Please, please.
Held with both hands
with a goofy expression.
I can't believe
we're actually gonna do this.
Marital status.
- Single.
- Single? Yeah.
- Yeah, do it, do it!
- Yeah!
Come on! Yeah.
Come on! Get it down, buddy!
Come on!
Come on! Knock it down!
Mine! Now it's all mine!
If we rent the studio for 1000...
and the one-bedroom for 1200...
Thirteen hundred.
You should go up and down.
All right, 1300.
- That leaves us...
- Fourteen hundred.
fourteen hundred
to cover the mortgage...
which is $300 a month less
than we used to pay...
for our two old apartments.
We're saving money.
Yeah. Assuming we don't go broke
before we rent them.
Then you've got to replace the plumbing
and rewire the electric.
Remember this is an investment.
Can't afford to do everything at once.
It's not just an investment.
It's our home.
Well. You want something
to drink?
Sure.
Hey, there's a cat outside.
Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Could be good luck.
- Could be hungry.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I'm pooped.
Is that your manly walk?
It's the only walk I've got.
- You feel comfortable.
- Yeah?
Like your old saddle?
Better. I just wish I had some spurs.
You taste like turpentine.
Hold on.
That's better.
- Hi there.
- Good afternoon!
- Welcome to the neighborhood, huh?
- Well, thank you.
I like your place.
Come on, Dad.
Nice!
Hi. How you doing today?
Fine, thank you.
How do you like the color?
Pretty good.
Hi! Mr. and Mrs. Thayer.
Drake Goodman.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Ran into double overtime
and I forgot about our appointment.
This is the apartment.
We're asking $1300 a month...
plus a $2000 security deposit.
You pay the gas and electric,
and we pay the water and garbage.
Here, take this.
In the back, we have the kitchen.
- Oh, it's great.
- Brand-new gas stove...
disposal, microwave,
brand-new refrigerator.
Stop that!
There's a full bath.
All the original tile's been redone.
It's the original bathtub.
We would want to repaint.
- Yeah, we'd pay for all the materials.
- It's just so chalky now.
What color did you have in mind?
- Black.
- Black.
Here's the gas stove, the dishwasher,
the microwave, the disposal.
I'm sure Drake showed you all this.
And your credit and references
all checked out, so...
Oh, we'll paint over that.
We'll paint over it.
- You don't have children, do you?
- No. This is a very nice place.
- We wanted to look at it again to be sure.
- I understand. Yeah.
Just got separated from my wife.
I'm hell in the kitchen.
I've been thinking about
taking a cooking class or something.
Excuse me.
We will take the apartment.
Oh, great. Okay.
We would like to start moving in
by tomorrow.
Pardon me. A thousand a month?
Yeah. Oh, and a $1500
security deposit.
I can handle that.
I'll have the key for you
in the morning, then.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Watanabe.
Domo, Mrs. Watanabe.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Any chance I can pay you half now,
half at the end of the month?
- I'm in this 90-day C/D, and...
- We'll have to check your credit.
No sweat. My credit's solid.
I've been looking to buy a place...
but I haven't found anything I like
for the price.
- Here you go.
- I said, my credit is solid.
You still have to
fill out an application...
- and Drake will want to check it out.
- Understand something.
I want this apartment.
My credit is good.
- I don't want to lose it...
- Obviously, you're at the top of the list.
You're the first person
who's seen the place.
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Miss Palmer?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry. I just get the runaround
so much, you know?
That's okay. No sweat.
- I'll get this back to you soon as I can.
- Okay.
Patty?
In here. I'm sick.
- What's the matter?
- I'll be all right. Answer the door.
It might be Mr. What's-His-Name
for the key to downstairs.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Mrs. Watanabe.
These are the keys
to the back apartment.
I'm so sorry so early.
That's okay. I'll just go get dressed.
All these people
aren't moving in with you, are they?
Mr. Palmer, right?
Goodman. Drake Goodman.
Sorry.
Very good.
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Carter Hayes.
I stopped by a couple of weeks ago
and spoke with your wife...
- about renting the studio apartment.
- Girlfriend.
Oh, your girlfriend. Oh, sorry.
We don't want to rush anything, do we?
- I assume it's still available?
- Yes, it is.
Is Patty here?
I don't want to keep you...
No problem.
I'm taking care of the rentals.
- Did she show you the apartment?
- No. I'd like to take a look.
Good. Yeah, we can go this way.
- Is it all right if I leave my car? Thanks.
- Yeah.
Boy, you've done
a beautiful job here.
Thank you. It's taken
just about every cent we've got.
Yeah. I'll bet.
I love these old Victorians.
My grandmother...
My father's mother, I guess it was.
- grew up in a mansion
in Pacific Heights.
Oh, yeah. Whereabouts?
Broadway and... I don't know.
I don't know. They tore it down.
I'd never actually been there,
but I'd seen photographs.
And I'd heard all the stories.
Can you imagine what that piece of
real estate would be worth today?
- Well, we all got to start somewhere.
- Yeah.
- Is this your first place?
- Yes, it is.
You and your girlfriend
went in on it together?
Yeah, you know, partners.
Yeah. It's hard, isn't it?
Well, it's the first time
we've lived together.
It's working, though.
Not to mention the rent we're saving.
When can I move in, Drake?
Well, I just have to have you
fill out an application...
I'd like to, if you don't mind,
pay you the first six months in advance.
- I still need you to get this...
- I may even have it on me.
The reason for the six months
is I travel a lot in my business.
I'm in and out of the country,
so I can't guarantee I'll be here...
the first of the month. Damn,
I've only got about $2900 on me.
How about if I pay you 2000 now...
and pay the rest next week?
Or wire you the entire amount...
which would be...
- Seventy-five hundred.
Seventy-five hundred
from my bank in San Antonio.
You know, I'm sorry...
but I have to get this application
filled out. It's just a formality.
Yeah, it's a credit history,
that sort of thing.
Yeah, is there a problem?
Well, no. It's just that
I work for a private trust...
and the trust pays me
my expenses and my salary.
They pay my bank cards,
my room and board, et cetera.
So I don't really have that traditional
kind of credit, you understand?
Could I verify the trust?
Well, see,
I'm bound by client confidentiality.
I mean, they're a prominent family
and they've got interests worldwide.
Boy, believe me, I would if I could.
Let me think.
I'm always running into this problem,
you know?
- Do you have a phone?
- Yeah. Upstairs.
You know, better yet,
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I give you
some personal references?
Or call the trust private attorney,
Bennett Fidlow.
- Yeah, okay. A previous landlord.
- I got it.
Yeah, I hope you don't mind
calling out of town.
I don't think you'll have a problem.
No, no. Mr. Hayes listed Mr. Fidlow...
as a personal reference
on a rental application.
I'm sorry.
What was that name again?
- Carter Hayes.
- Hayes. Mr. Fidlow only handles private...
Ma'am. Yes, Mr. Hayes told me
that it was a private family trust.
This is a personal reference.
He'll have to give you
that information himself.
I see. Well, when Mr. Fidlow gets time,
could you please have him call me?
I will. Goodbye.
Mo. no. He was a model tenant.
Always paid rent on time,
left the unit spotlessly clean.
In fact, I think I gave him
his whole security deposit back.
That was the first time
I've ever done that.
So you can definitely
recommend Mr. Hayes?
I can recommend him to you
with no hesitation at all.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Listen, just out of curiosity...
where has Carter moved to, Mr...?
- Goodman.
- Mr. Goodman.
Just out of curiosity,
do you have that address?
- What about Mr. Baker?
- What about him?
He was here first.
Well, where's his application?
Maybe he's one of those
minority scam artists.
What are you talking about?
They try to get you worried
about discrimination...
so you don't check their credit.
- That's not what happened.
Some of these people
can be pretty shrewd, Patty.
How would you know?
It's not a racial thing.
It's just common sense.
Look, I spoke to
the woman at the bank...
and she told me that Carter Hayes'
income is over $200,000 a year.
I've checked him out.
Okay, fine. Then let's rent to him
if you say he's okay.
- He's a nice guy. You met him.
- When?
A couple weeks ago.
He said he came by and talked to you.
I don't think so.
He knew your name.
Why would he say that if he hadn't?
I don't know.
Look, Patty,
I'm just taking up the slack here.
You're worried about
paint and wallpaper.
Somebody's got to rent these
so we can make next month's mortgage.
You're losing your sense of humor.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
You're becoming a crotchety old man
with his building.
Next thing, you're going to have hair
growing out of weird parts of your face.
Be wandering around
with a toilet plunger...
griping about property taxes
and people who take long showers.
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.
No, I won't.
You don't think I can handle this?
Yes, I do.
Is somebody in here?
Oh, hi.
I thought you were
from the phone company.
Who are you?
I'm your new tenant.
I'm Carter Hayes.
You must be Patty, right?
Yeah.
- I think I spoke with you a couple of...
- No, you didn't.
How did you get in here?
Well, the door was open a little
and I just opened it and came on in.
I didn't wanna ring the buzzer,
bother you so early...
so I just let myself in.
Hope that's okay.
Drake said it would be all right
if I came by for the phone installation.
Was that you hammering?
No.
You did a great job
restoring this place.
Thanks.
Did you pick those light fixtures out?
Yeah.
You have nice taste.
Thanks.
Nice meeting you.
I found a roofer. It's gonna cost us
75 bucks for an estimate.
It's a good thing I rented
that other apartment.
Mr. Hayes is downstairs.
What do you mean
he's downstairs?
In the apartment.
Did you let him in?
He was already in.
I told him he can't move in
till we get his money.
Well, I heard hammering,
and there he was.
What was he hammering?
He said he wasn't.
Mr. Hayes.
It's Drake Goodman.
Carter?
Is anybody in there?
Sorry, but we have no record of a wire
transfer to your account, Mr. Goodman.
My tenant assured me
the money would be wired today.
Bank of Texas.
Seventy-five hundred dollars.
Maybe the bank lost the money
or it got credited to the wrong account.
It's doubtful. But I'd need
the transaction numbers...
to tell you anything more.
It is possible he never
wired the money, Mr. Goodman.
For his own reasons.
Look, please, just check the account
one more time.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm the landlord.
Carter went to Seattle on business.
He'll be back on Friday.
Carter was supposed to wire me some
money for his rent and security deposit.
I don't know anything about that.
You're gonna have to talk to Carter.
What's your name?
- Greg.
- Greg, listen...
if you speak to Carter
before Friday...
tell him that he's got this problem
with his rent...
Sounds like your problem.
Ask him to call me
with transaction numbers...
or give them to you to give me
so we can straighten this out.
Yeah. I'll be sure
to give him the message.
You just hit a wire. It's okay.
I'll go down and fix it.
Don't pull that nail
until I say it's okay.
All right.
You require new wires.
This is a very dangerous situation.
Okay!
I got it!
Is it on?
No!
How about now?
Not yet!
Drake?
No, Patty!
Did that do it?
Not yet.
There you go.
Okay.
Mr. Hayes?
Is that you?
Mr. Hayes?
- Drake.
- Hey, you fixed it.
Hayes is down there,
sitting in his car.
He was just watching me.
Hayes!
Hayes!
No, thank you.
I've left my number before.
And Mr. Fidlow has never
returned my phone call.
- What was that name again?
- Carter Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.
I've left you this information before.
Well. I'm sorry. sir.
We do not have a client by that name.
Well, maybe,
maybe you can explain to me...
how it is that Mr. Fidlow
doesn't know Carter Hayes...
when Mr. Hayes, who's locked himself
into my goddamn apartment...
hasn't paid rent...
keeps telling me to call his
goddamn attorney, Bennett Fidlow...
in San fucking Antonio, Texas!
Hello?
Hello!
What's the most important thing...
I said to remember
when we're riding?
We're the boss.
That's right.
And why are we the boss?
Because we're smarter.
Absolutely.
Okay, that's enough
for today. Dismount.
- Will you take over, Jonna?
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Okay, guys, remember:
Take the reins in your right hand,
stay on the left side of your horse.
You look so serious.
Rough day at work.
It's a kite-eat-kite world
out there, Patty.
You know, I was thinking
we could sneak out tonight.
I made a reservation
at Mama Chiam's.
I don't know if I'm up to it.
A bottle of wine, a nice dinner.
It will do us both good.
I went to the doctor today.
Why?
I can't seem to shake this flu
I've been fighting...
so I figured I'd just
make an appointment and go.
- What did he say?
- It's definitely not the flu.
That's good, then.
Maybe we'd both feel better...
if we went out and had fun.
Hayes' rent didn't come, did it?
No. Tomorrow probably.
- Probably?
- Yeah. It's a bank mix-up.
- I'm on top of it. Don't worry about it.
- Drake...
Look, I got us into this, Patty,
I'll get us out.
End of discussion.
End of discussion?
The doctor says I'm pregnant.
Congratulations.
- Hello.
- Miss Palmer?
Who is this?
Yeah, I come here and knock.
Nobody answers.
Hammering stops.
I go back, bang, bang, bang.
I don't like this guy.
It's Drake Goodman, the landlord.
May I come in?
Look, I know you're in there.
I can hear you in there.
I've got a key. So if you don't open
the door, I'm gonna come in anyway.
He's changed the locks.
You changed the fucking locks!
All right.
Good night.
I don't care if he comes through
with the money now or not.
I just want him out.
No harm, no foul.
He leaves right away,
he doesn't owe us anything.
Goodbye. Good riddance.
Now what?
Jesus.
Yes? Who is it?
San Francisco Police Department.
They were doing construction
at 2-fucking-30 in the morning.
Won't answer the door.
I can't use my key to get in.
They've changed all the fucking locks.
I don't appreciate foul language, sir.
Officer, may I say something?
My friend is a sculptor.
He was working late last night.
- Sorry if he kept anyone up.
- Bullshit!
- You back off.
- He hasn't even paid his rent. Ask him.
There has been a mix-up in the wire
transfer of my money. Sorry.
They've moved in there.
Changed the locks so I can't see
what he and his buddy are destroying.
He hasn't paid the rent
or even a security fucking deposit!
- Take it easy.
- Look, I can handle this, Patty!
- Fine.
- Listen, listen, listen.
I understand
why Mr. Goodman is upset.
His bank lost my money.
I was out of town.
He's in the middle.
I don't wanna file a complaint.
I don't understand why he wouldn't
want to straighten things out...
unless he's found somebody else.
- Bullshit!
Look, let's take a walk.
Come on. Now!
I just want the guy to pay his rent!
Come on. Cool it down.
What? What?
- What you did is against the law.
- Well, my other tenants...
Listen, I'm truly sorry
it's come to this.
The bank assures me
the money's been sent.
- I don't think Drake un...
- I'd like you to not talk to me.
Listen, I just want the guy
the hell out of my house!
Listen, or he's gonna be
so far up your butt...
you're gonna be picking him
out your nose.
I want you to turn back on
all the heat and all the power...
to this man's apartment.
You apologize, and you do not,
and I emphasize "do not"...
harass him again.
Then go out and get yourself a lawyer.
According to California Civil Code...
Mr. Hayes can sue you
for this stunt you just pulled.
And most likely, he'll win.
He doesn't have a right to be in
the apartment. He hasn't paid rent!
Are you listening to me? If he's in,
he's got rights. That's how it works.
And I'll tell you something else, friend.
If he decides to fight an eviction...
you're already knee-deep in shit.
Get a lawyer.
He's taken possession.
So whether he signed a lease...
or whether he paid you money or not.
he's legally your tenant now.
And he's protected by laws
that say you have to go to court...
and prove that he deserves
to be evicted.
However,
the net effect of these laws...
is to protect
any pointy-headed cretin...
who moves into your property...
and slowly drives you
bankrupt and insane.
So, what do we do?
I can take on the case.
What are our chances of winning?
No guarantees.
My base fee for an uncontested case
is $250.
We charge $90 an hour thereafter...
and a minimum of $360
for any court appearances.
- How long will it take?
- Uncontested, six to eight weeks.
- If he contests?
- Six to eight months, worst case.
Then you have to go after him
in court again to collect.
Wouldn't it be easier
to throw him out?
Easy and wrong.
This is the process, folks.
There aren't any shortcuts.
I need a description of Hayes
for Mr. Revilla. my process server...
and I need the key
to your front door.
- Is Carter Hayes in?
- No.
I have some important
documents for him.
Okay.
All right.
Get them shined, get them shined.
Buddy, you need to get in that bank
and get a loan.
Look at them shoes.
All right. Low-investment loans
for people like shoes like yours.
Come. Get a good shine right here.
I'll put a glow on that sole.
All right. Who's next?
Ladies in skirts, half price.
Come here, sunshine.
Get that half-price special right here
on Dr. Shoe Love.
Get them shined,
get them shined here.
Shine them up, shine them up.
Where you going?
All right. All right.
Let me just guess what they said.
"As much as we'd like to help you,
we can't afford to string out the loan.
It wouldn't be fair to us,
it wouldn't be fair to you".
- Right.
- They say the bank is pulling for you...
that no one wants to foreclose a loan?
They tell you that?
That's horse-puckey. Bankerspeak.
So, what do we do now, Reed?
I can loan you maybe a grand,
but that's not gonna help.
It's not gonna do it. There are
alternative lenders, you know...
high-interest houses
that specialize in burying you.
"Let a smile be your umbrella".
Great.
- I could start riding again.
- Oh, that's a good idea, Patty.
You're pregnant with a blown knee.
- You think you could ride in competition?
- Wait. Are you pregnant?
My knee is fine.
And I don't have to be pregnant.
I'm not going to lose you,
I'm not going to lose our child...
and I'm not going to lose our house.
Well, I guess we can just
stop worrying now.
Listen to this.
"Dear Drake and Patty...
I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding
that has come between us.
Please accept this gift in my sincere
hope that we can work everything out.
Carter Hayes".
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Mrs. Patty! Mrs. Patty!
What? What, Mrs. Watanabe?
Kitchen! Kitchen!
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
In here?
What?
Oh, shit!
Shit!
The San Francisco roach
is generally German...
or oriental in derivation. With your
krauts edging out your rice grinders...
in the overall disgustingness factor.
But I think these are American.
How are we supposed to pay?
We're $1100 short this month!
- Don't yell at me.
- Yankee roach...
If we don't do it, MacDonald says
we lose the eviction.
We can't afford that either.
Maybe we should borrow money for this.
No. No, we're not
gonna borrow money.
This is stupid!
We should just let this building go.
Okay, fine!
You do whatever you want.
I'm not letting this jerk
chase me out of my property.
It's that promiscuity factor
that makes it hard to hammer down.
I'll be using pyrethrin
in a high-pressure injection system.
I've also got the R.S.U.
- What's that?
- Roach-sucking unit.
It's just a backup.
They're coming in from next door.
Oh, shit.
Oh, reinforcements. Holy...
They're probably camped
in the other apartment.
If we could go at it from there,
we'd have a chance at containment.
What if we can't?
Get a whole bunch of little tiny leashes
and pretend they're pets.
I'm sorry.
You know?
Our luck
has gotta change tomorrow.
Maybe.
- Yeah?
- Carter Hayes lives here, doesn't he?
- Yes.
- Yeah, well, do you know if he's in?
There doesn't seem to be
any answer.
I don't know.
- Is Carter Hayes in there?
- No, he's not here.
Look, I'm Ann.
Did he tell you about me?
He must have told you about me.
Ann from the desert.
I've been driving all night. I don't
have time. I'm not leaving until I...
- Why don't you just come in here, okay?
- Let go of me.
- Shut up.
- Are you his partner?
- None of your business!
- I need to talk to him.
- About what?
- You're not that stupid. Figure it out.
No, I'm sorry. It was a gift.
Was it 18-karat gold, 14-karat gold?
I have no knowledge of jewelry.
I just... I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- I just need money desperately.
Next.
All right, what we got?
The only way I can swing it
is if you deposit $5800 with us.
If you do that,
I can give you $5000.
That's what we call a secured loan.
You'll get the money
in a couple of days. No qualifying.
If I had $5800,
I wouldn't need to borrow anything.
Right.
I guess we won't be
doing any business.
Wait. Your ad in the Yellow Pages
said that you give high-risk loans...
that you specialize in giving loans
to people who can't get a loan anyplace.
Don't believe everything
you read, okay?
I've gone through the figures
three times. I cannot do it.
All I'm asking for is $5000
to get us through a few months.
You have a $750,000
piece of property here.
Sell your building
and keep the change.
I can't sell the building.
- Is she done yet?
- She's done.
Damn.
- Is there something you wanna tell me?
- What do you mean?
I think there's stuff
you're not telling me, Carter.
There are a lot of things
I'm not telling.
- Your girlfriend came by the other day.
- So?
So she told me that the two of you
made 250 grand...
on a real-estate deal like this.
She didn't see any of it.
She's mistaken.
She's a useless bitch anyway.
She didn't have to do anything.
I had the whole thing wired.
Listen to me, and listen to me carefully,
okay? This is my business...
and I'm very good at it, Greg.
- Yeah?
How come we're getting evicted
so soon?
- You said that wasn't gonna happen.
- Not an issue.
I told you from the get-go
there was gonna be risks involved...
and you have to be flexible!
- Yeah, well, don't bullshit me, Carter.
I just want you to know
that I know...
if you cut me out...
- What?
- Just don't do it!
- Or what? Or what?
Drake?
Drake!
- Drake?
- What?
Oh, God.
I almost ran over
that guy from downstairs.
I thought maybe you'd gotten
in a fight with him.
They've got our cat down there,
and they're breeding roaches.
Apparently, screwing people over
is just a job to them.
What are you talking about?
Isn't that the best?
I mean, our life is coming apart...
and this son of a bitch just thinks
it's business as usual.
- Oh, Drake.
- This is what he does for a living.
You're drunk.
Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
- You'll like this too.
This was under the door
when I came in.
It's from the Watanabes.
It's the noise and the bugs...
and my wife, she can't sleep.
Me, I'm so sorry. It's no good.
You signed a lease for one year,
Mr. Watanabe.
I will try to pay you back.
Moving expense,
new apartment expense...
lots of expense.
You can take me to court.
Sue me, but...
So sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Well...
I guess there's nothing else to say.
Good fortune.
Yeah.
In answer to your suit
against him...
Mr. Hayes has submitted to the court
Affidavits A and B...
confirming plaintiff's attempted
unlawful eviction of a Mr. Hayes...
on the 15th of last May.
I turned his gas and electricity off.
There was a policeman there.
- Your Honor, my clients and I...
- I assume you have received these?
Yes, I think there's been a mix-up.
I think the law is quite clear
on this point, don't you?
Mr. Hayes is entitled to a reduction
of rent due to uninhabitability...
caused by Mr. Goodman's attempt
to force him from the premises...
by disconnecting his utilities.
The court rules
for the defendant, Carter Hayes.
Let the record show,
according to the lease...
Mr. Hayes' legal cost
is to be paid by the plaintiff.
I would like to ask
for a 10-minute postponement.
Miss MacDonald, you have other cases
before this court.
Hope you're better prepared
for them.
I assume you'll want to cooperate
in keeping things moving.
Yes, sir.
That's it?
Why didn't you tell me
you tried to force him out?
- I didn't think it mattered.
- It set us back months.
- He's lying.
- This guy has been playing you...
like a piano concerto.
Me? What about you?
I got a guy living in my building
who hasn't paid me one cent.
Not only can't you get him out,
but now I owe him money?
Maybe you'd like to
retain another attorney.
Stephanie.
Please don't quit.
Drake's been under
a lot of pressure.
The bank is threatening
to foreclose on us.
This isn't a moral question, Patricia.
Morally, you're right.
You win. Big deal.
This is a game,
and the object of the game...
is to get Mr. Hayes out of your
building before he destroys your lives.
He knows you're gonna get him out.
He's trying to stay as long as he can.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Because it's possible,
because he's evil.
What difference does it make?
It's nothing personal.
God forbid he ever makes it personal.
- Drake!
- Son of a...
Stop it!
No, stop! Damn it, Drake!
- Goddamn it.
- What?
What is happening to you?
I want him out of here!
Patty?
Patty?
Patty?
Oh, hon.
- Patty.
- Oh, God.
Just a couple more tests for you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How do you feel?
I feel like Lady Macbeth.
There was so much blood.
Everything's gonna be all right.
You know, the doctor says...
we can even try again
after a few months.
911 Emergency.
Get me the police, please.
Something's gotta change, Drake.
You and me in this place...
it's just not working.
Drake.
What do you expect me
to say to that, Patty?
Fine? Nice knowing you?
Jesus.
That's not what I meant.
I don't know
what I expect anymore.
Maybe that's part of the problem.
I'm sorry I talked you into
buying this place.
You didn't talk me into anything.
Patty.
Something was right
about us before.
Whatever else has got screwed up,
we have to remember that.
Hi, I didn't want to intrude...
but I heard the ambulance
last night.
I called the hospital.
They told me what happened.
God.
Nature can be so cruel sometimes.
Anyway, Patty,
I wanted to offer my condolences.
If there's anything at all
I can do to help...
Drake!
Drake!
Drake, stop! Stop it!
Drake, stop it. You'll kill him. Stop it!
Drake, goddamn it!
Stop it!
Drake, are you all right?
Are you all right?
- I'm sorry, Patty.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Get down from there.
No, no, no. Officer!
Officer! Hey! Hey!
Don't hurt him!
What are you arresting me for?
He didn't do anything.
You have the right
to remain silent.
- He didn't do anything.
- We got an ambulance.
It's the other guy.
Please don't hurt him.
- to speak to an attorney
and have an attorney present...
You're arresting the wrong man!
- Can I go with him? Please?
- No.
Keep struggling, I'll break your
goddamn arm. Watch your head.
Fucking bastards.
You got the wrong fucking man!
You arrested the wrong man!
There's nothing you can do
until the arraignment tomorrow morning.
He needs a criminal law
specialist, Patricia.
I'm out of my depth here.
I can recommend somebody.
My guess is that Hayes doesn't care
about the criminal charges.
He's gonna go after Drake
with a civil suit.
This is what he wanted.
Game's over. Drake loses.
Can I give you a ride home?
What does this do to the eviction?
Ironically, nothing will get him out.
Of course, Hayes might get the building
before he's through...
because of the civil suit.
It's lucky you're not married, otherwise
Drake would pull you down with him.
I had a miscarriage last night.
I know.
I need to know
where Drake will be staying.
- He'll be at home with me.
- Patty...
Hayes is asking for a temporary
restraining order because of the assault.
Drake can't come within 500 feet
of the building as long as Hayes is there.
This is our home.
This is all happening to us
in our home.
I know.
Want a hand?
No, no, I got it.
Better get some clean sheets.
These look pretty rude.
Hello.
Hello?
Patty.
You know...
I think that under
different circumstances...
you and I could have
gotten to be good friends.
The time allotted for you to dial
has been exceeded.
Please hang up and dial again.
The time allotted for you to dial
has been exceeded.
Please hang up and dial again.
Get it started, huh?
Now watch this.
Voilà.
I'll get that. Hang on, man.
Don't burn the house down.
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.
Is everything all right?
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.
Fine. You know,
it only hurts when I blink.
Is something wrong?
No, I just... I miss you.
Why don't you come over here?
This is ridiculous. Why don't you
come here and spend the night?
It's okay. Somebody's gotta be here.
Nobody has to be there.
- Tell me what's wrong.
- Everything's fine.
- Mo. Patty...
- I better...
- I better go. Don't worry.
- Patty.
- Bye.
- Patty. you're not...
You're a very brave
and stupid man.
What are you doing, Drake?
You can't come in here.
Listen, Carter...
it's no big deal.
I just want to go upstairs
and see Patty, okay?
But you're breaking the law, Drake.
Wait a minute.
Oh, goddamn it.
Hi.
I really screwed things up.
I don't know
what I've been trying to prove.
Don't talk.
What was I trying to prove?
You don't have to prove anything.
Go to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too.
We have no case, because Hayes...
was technically within his right
to protect himself.
Goodman threatens Hayes,
who, fearing for his life...
based upon
the previous complaint...
defends himself.
- You're the DA, Henry. Make a case.
There's a history
of mutual animosity here.
There's a history of Goodman
assaulting Hayes.
I can make a case, but I can't win it.
What's the point?
- They're a nice couple.
- Right.
Well, at least the default judgment
came through today.
We're evicting the son of a bitch
tomorrow.
I'll need you to sign right here.
Mr. Carter Hayes?
It's the sheriff's department, Mr. Hayes.
We've come to see you out.
Appointed locksmith, Manfred Bagil,
will facilitate entry at this point.
Oh, God.
Damn.
God, this is bad.
How much can he make
off of this crap?
God!
Look, I don't have his name here.
He's probably at the station.
I I
Gas stove, microwave...
disposal, dishwasher...
two sinks, one toilet"?
About how many electrical fixtures
would you guess?
I don't know.
Okay, it's not important but, you know,
we will need it for your insurance.
- We're gonna need a complete list.
- Our insurance was canceled.
- Yeah.
- Patricia Palmer still with you?
- Yeah.
- I'd like to speak with her.
Sure, come on in.
That's my boss.
Here you go.
I recognized the name on the report.
You two know each other?
Why don't you take these, see if we can
get a start on where this cretin...
might fence appliances. Thank you.
- Sure thing, lieutenant.
I guess you're wishing now
you'd rented to the black man.
You never brought back
your application.
I brought it back.
I never got it.
The Porsche in your garage
was leased.
Hayes made one payment,
put stolen plates on.
They've been looking for him since.
I sent a tow over
to haul away what's left of it.
He shot my boyfriend.
I know.
You're lucky he didn't kill him.
This is a sick individual, Ms. Palmer.
Be grateful he's out of your life.
Right now,
you don't mean a thing to him.
Leave it that way. If he's gonna
get caught, we'll catch him.
He shot my boyfriend.
My boyfriend is in the hospital.
He destroyed our property.
There are lawsuits, there's a foreclosure.
I had a miscarriage.
And you're telling me
to forget about him?
Next time, maybe he ain't so lucky.
Next time, maybe he runs into the man
who blows his brains out.
Next time?
Let him go, Ms. Palmer.
- Mr. Fidlow.
- May I ask what it's concerning?
It's regarding James Danforth.
- Yes, ma'am.
- It's a Patricia Palmer on Line 1...
regarding James Danforth.
- Put her through.
How can I help you?
Yeah. you represent
Charles and James Danforth?
I'm executor of a family trust...
a special conservatorship
benefiting James Danforth...
but this should not be confused
with being his attorney...
whatever he's told you.
- Are you aware...?
- Furthermore...
whatever James has done,
the trust cannot be touched...
and neither I nor his brother
can or will...
be held accountable
for his activities.
You mean his family pays him
to stay away?
I'm afraid I can't comment on that.
Well, where is he now?
Look. you just best
let this sleeping dog lie.
- Where...?
- Lady...
he's been out of control
for a long time.
Well, maybe I should just
go to his brother directly.
You can't touch him, Ms. Palmer.
James has no assets...
the trust cannot be attached...
and he is legally severed
from his family.
I don't want money, Mr. Fidlow.
I just want to know where he is.
He doesn't tell me where he is. Ever.
Well. then tell me where he's been.
He's far and away
the most intelligent man I've ever met.
He's not your type.
Oh, it's okay to want him.
It's a free country.
I could tell, you know,
when I saw you up in Frisco.
I could tell you had a thing for him.
Are you his type?
What do you think?
I think you're sitting here
waiting for him...
and meanwhile,
he's blown you off...
and it's pretty pathetic.
You don't even know him.
You don't even know his real name.
It isn't Hayes, you know.
It isn't Carter Hayes.
Carter Hayes is the stupid old man
who owned this condo.
He tried to throw us out...
he sent his tough guys after us
to rough us up...
but now look who's here
and look who's not.
You're the pathetic one.
And he didn't blow me off.
He sent me a postcard
just yesterday.
Read it.
He's not like anyone else.
He does what he wants.
We understand each other.
That's what we have.
You?
You're just chasing a shadow.
Yes, Andre.
I need it delivered immediately
to Room 1550.
Excuse me.
Yes. Thank you.
Do you have someone named
Carter Hayes staying here?
Hayes? I'll check.
No, I'm sorry. We don't.
How about Goodman?
Drake Goodman?
Goodman?
I'll check.
We do, but I see that he's out.
Well, he left this
in the store where I work.
- Think you could give it to him?
- Certainly.
- Would you care to leave your name...?
- No, thank you.
Front desk. Victor.
Hello?
Special delivery. Room 81.
- Special delivery? Has not yet arrived.
- Yes, special delivery.
- It's not here.
- Room 81.
- Special delivery has not yet arrived.
- Really?
It's not here.
- Special delivery is not here.
- It must be.
Not arrived? Sure?
- Bye. Bye-bye.
- Later on.
- Yes.
- Later.
- 1031.
- 1031?
- Mr. Goodman?
- That's right.
No messages.
Oh, a young woman
returned your wallet, sir.
- Pardon?
- She found it in the store...
where she works.
Oh, yeah. Great. Thanks.
Mr. Goodman, how are you?
- Hi. How are you?
- Come on in.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was just wondering
if you could let me into my room.
My dumb husband's locked me out
and I thought...
Which room?
1031. Goodman.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
That damn son of a bitch!
Goddamn motherfucker!
Is everything okay?
Yes.
- Hello.
- Oh. good. I'm so glad you're home.
You're not. Where are you?
- You went after him?
- Absolutely.
Look, I don't have much time
and I need you to help me, okay?
Call and cancel your credit cards.
Hayes is using duplicates
with your name.
- Great.
- Then call the bank...
put a hold on our checking account.
- Why?
There's a 24-hour hot line.
I think the number's on top of...
On top of the last bank statement.
I know. What are you doing?
Something that's gonna make us
feel good.
- Be careful.
- I'll be back tonight. Bye.
Hello. Room service.
Gary speaking.
Hi, this is Mrs. Goodman
in Room 1031.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
My husband and I would like to have
a dinner party up here...
and charge it to the room.
- What would you like?
- I'd like to have vichyssoise...
- Vichyssoise.
and caesar salad and filet mignon.
- Caesar salad. Filet mignon.
What do you have for dessert?
Do you have crème brûlée?
Of course we do. yes.
With raspberry sauce.
- Sounds good.
- Yes. What beverage would you like?
- We'll need a full bar, coffee, dessert.
- Full bar.
Of course.
How many people is this for?
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen?
- Very good.
- How long will that be?
- At least two hours.
- Two hours?
- Can you put a rush on it?
- We try. We try, yes.
Great. By the way...
it's our anniversary today,
and my husband would like...
to send a bottle of champagne
to everybody on the 10th floor.
Everyone on the 10th floor?
That's very generous.
Well, that's the kind of man
that he is.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Goodman.
- Any messages?
- 1031?
- No messages.
- Mr. Goodman...
may I please have a word with you?
I'm sorry to trouble you, sir...
but we seem to be having
a problem with your credit card.
Really? What kind of problem?
This is Lieutenant Palmer from
the San Francisco Police.
Yes. can I help you?
I was wondering if you leased
a black Cadillac Coupe DeVille...
with the license plate number
2PET764...
to a man named Drake Goodman.
Let me check.
- Yes. we did.
- You did?
- Why?
- There's some things that I think...
you might be interested in knowing.
Why don't I write a check to take care of
things until we get this straightened out?
That wouldn't be acceptable.
I'm sorry.
We called your bank... As a backup.
- Yeah.
- They said your account has been frozen.
Yes. I'd like to report
some stolen traveler's checks.
- Lost or stolen?
- My husband is certain...
they've been stolen.
All 30 of them.
I assumed you got the necessary
approval when I checked in.
Yes, but when a customer charges
over $100 to their room...
we run a card again for approval and
that's when we discovered the problem.
- I didn't charge anything to my room.
- It's probably clerical error on their part.
We have to look out for ourselves.
You understand?
- I didn't charge anything to my room!
- Well, maybe it was your wife.
My wife?
Mr. Goodman?
Excuse me, Mr. Goodman.
- Not now.
- Mr. Goodman...
- Taxi.
- I cannot allow you to leave...
- Evening.
- until we get this straightened out.
Mr. Goodman! The hotel has
a very strict policy in this matter.
We will... I assure you,
we will take legal steps immediately.
Mr. Goodman, we will call the police!
Get out of the street!
They're lying.
These people
are completely pathological.
They took a half year's rent from me,
and they said I never paid them.
They evicted me, they slandered me,
they totally destroyed my credit.
They physically assaulted me.
They threatened my life.
And now this.
These people are parasites.
Florence...
I am so sorry...
that you were even touched
by any of this.
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.
When I first met you,
I was enchanted...
and I was dazzled.
I'm sorry.
It's not like I can't prove they're lying.
I can prove they're lying.
It's gonna take a little time.
I'll have to take them to court, I guess.
But for right now,
it's my word against theirs, isn't it?
I don't know
what these people want.
You know that if they hadn't
tied up my trust...
I would never ask you for anything.
But if the bail isn't paid,
I can't get out of here...
and I cannot prove to you, sir...
what I hope Florence
already knows in her heart.
At least, I would hope
that you know.
Look...
I'm just asking you to do...
whatever it is
your heart tells you to do.
Oh, not again.
TV 20.
And now one of the most unusual
buys you will ever see.
A six-piece faux-pony-fur desk set.
And we have a caller right now.
Hi. Who am I speaking to?
- Hi. This is Mary.
- Where are you calling from?
- From Santa Fe.
- Santa Fe?
- This desk set is perfect for you, isn't it?
- David, I just love this, so I got three.
- You got a great buy on these.
- I know.
- You know. They're only $54 right now.
- I know that.
- Isn't this unbelievable?
- Yeah.
I have varicose veins.
and I hate to shop at malls.
This is perfect. I can pull out
my Visa. dial the phone...
- it's great.
- You just prop up your feet...
relax and enjoy yourself.
and keep on shopping.
Okay. you guys.
stay here and keep me covered.
Kitty?
Kitty?
Kitty?
Kitty?
Kitty.
Kitty.
Kitty, you bad cat.
Where have you been?
You scared me to death
down there.
Kitty. Kitty!
Kitty.
Kitty?
Help!
You crossed the line.
You were in my room.
You were in my private things.
You and your boyfriend...
you insult my intelligence.
You got into my area.
What are you doing?
How am I gonna make a living now?
What am I gonna tell my family, huh?
Did you know half of all homicide victims
are killed with their own handguns?
- Did you know that?
- No, no.
Stop!
Stop!
What am I gonna do with you, Patty?
What are you making me do here?
Don't you know
I have responsibilities?
I've got people. I've got my brother.
I mean, I've got a lot of people
who depend on me.
Then you come along. I mean...
what was the point?
How did it feel, huh, Patty?
- Did it feel good, is that it?
- No.
When you were in my private things,
spying on me...
it felt good, didn't it?
- No.
Yes, it did.
You crossed the line, and it felt good.
- No. No.
- You're lying.
- You're lying.
- No. No!
Help me!
It's a Victorian.
It was built in 1883.
Somebody remodeled it in the '40s...
but we tried to restore it back to its
original state the best that we could.
- You did all the work yourself?
- Yeah, most of it.
Do you know how hard it is
to find packing boxes?
- Hi. I actually had to buy these.
- Hi.
Honey... This is Drake.
This is Bill and Amy.
- I'm Bill.
- Nice to meet you.
Amy, nice to meet you.
We were just telling Patty
how impressed we are...
with all the work you've done.
Thank you.
So you wanna buy the place?
Well, it's a little more money
than we thought of originally...
but it's great.
Well, you know, you've got the two
rental units to help make the mortgage.
Well, we'd sure need it.
Oh, honey, look at these floors.
They're gorgeous.
- Yeah, we just refinished them.
- We just had them refinished.
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Why don't we leave you alone to talk?
And we'll be right upstairs
if you need us, packing, okay?
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah.
- Patty?
- Yeah?
Do you mind if I ask you
why you're selling?
You've done so much to this place.
You obviously put your heart in it.
No, not really.
It was just an investment.
I know you love it,
but we're talking about $900,000.
I bet we can offer them 850 or 825.
Oh, that's all. Okay.
What if we don't qualify
for a bank loan?
We will.
First thing I'm gonna do is take
these curtains off these windows.
Can we talk about the purchase price
before you redesign the entire place?
Oh, I just have so many ideas.
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay, huh?
Well, as long as you say so.
I know so.
