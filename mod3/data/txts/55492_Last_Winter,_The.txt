<i>Alaska: vast wilderness of the North.</i>
<i>Land of great natural
beauty and diversity.</i>
<i>This is rugged country.</i>
<i>Land of black gold.</i>
<i>Alaska's north slope
has been producing oil</i>
<i>out of Prudhoe Bay since 1968,</i>
<i>delivering to refineries and ports
800 miles to the south</i>
<i>through the great
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.</i>
<i>But another northern region</i>
<i>known as the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge</i>
<i>has remained untapped.</i>
<i>Only once have prospectors
gained access</i>
<i>to this barren landscape.</i>
<i>In 1986, the KIK Corporation,</i>
<i>a partnership between native
and business interests,</i>
<i>commissioned the drilling of a test well.</i>
<i>The results of that drilling</i>
<i>have been a carefully
guarded secret ever since,</i>
<i>with only a solitary white box</i>
<i>marking the footprint
where the rig once stood.</i>
<i>Now, at last, after
an historic vote in Congress,</i>
<i>the KIK well will reveal her secrets,</i>
<i>and North Industries will be there.</i>
<i>Working in consort
with environmental experts,</i>
<i>North Industries will send
advance teams to map the area</i>
<i>and determine strategic drilling locations.</i>
<i>Ice roads will be constructed
to transport the rigs,</i>
<i>and drill sites and pipelines</i>
<i>will be operational within the decade.</i>
<i>One step closer
to energy independence.</i>
<i>We have got the vision, the experience,</i>
<i>the know-how.</i>
<i>North Industries.</i>
<i>Trust. Risk. Results.</i>
Jesus Christ, Ed.
I could use a longer runway.
Sounds like a personal problem, Gary.
It's on my list. That's a for-sure.
Go get my gear, will ya?
<i>- Oy, Ed.
- Motor!</i>
Rise and shine!
Where's Abby?
Where's my welcoming party?
<i>A good 30, 40 miles per hour.</i>
<i>Occasional flurries after midnight...</i>
Abby, God damn it, you're beautiful.
You took my room!
I want it back.
With you in it.
- Hiya, Ed.
- How you doin'?
- A hundred percent, Abs.
A hundred and fifty.
Hey.
Yeah. I put on a few.
- Well, you know...
- Is that Ed Pollack I hear?
Aw, baby! You sight for sore eyes!
How's that new exercise regime going?
<i>Okay. Put me down.
Dinner's almost ready.</i>
Lee. Pipe down, will ya?
You're far too excitable.
Yeah, Lee. Pipe down.
It is good to see this
team taking shape here.
You know? The big boys,
they send their love.
Everybody's gearing up.
Where's the kid?
<i>Oh, Maxwell is out on the flats.</i>
Should be back by now.
I'm supposed to keep my eye on him,
you know? For the old man.
Gary's taking off.
He wanted to beat the snow.
Aw. I wanted him to stay for a drink!
Hey, Dawn, find some glasses, will ya?
Boy, he's sure in a hurry.
What ya got in the bag, boss?
Mind your damn manners, Motor.
Hey, Dawn, where's those glasses?
<i>Oh. This is Elliot Taylor.</i>
He is doing the impact evaluations.
I thought the new green
flag was named Hoffman.
That's my boss.
They sent two guys?
This what you were looking for, Motor?
Mm-hmm.
A little fish.
Cigarettes.
This one looks sexy.
<i>Harvest Nights.</i>
Stogies.
Good one, Ed.
And...
more fish.
Is this gonna be Maxwell?
Hi.
James Hoffman, meet Ed Pollack.
How ya doing?
I'm doing fine.
Before your time.
Listen up. This is what I want to say.
Now, I know you've...
all been in a holding pattern,
and I want to apologize for that.
These ice roads have been
a bitch to get in,
and Hoffman can give you
the reason for that.
It's not cold enough.
Hell, it feels cold as a witch's boob
out here to me.
Well, you need a sustained sub-zero
to build those roads.
Well, then find me some sub-zero!
I mean, we're in fucking Alaska!
It's the Arctic Circle!
It's the dead of winter here!
Well, that's exactly the problem.
The temperature's
been all over the place.
So, ... how is it
that you come to work for North?
I mean... you're not the type.
We don't work for North.
We work for the American people
to make sure that North
keeps its end of the bargain up here,
being on this land.
What the American people
want is energy independence.
That's what
the American people want.
Hell, the amount of oil
that they're gonna get out of here
they could save by inflating their tires
and caulking their windows.
Hoffman knows all that crap.
He's an oil geek.
He was at the Kuwaiti oil field fires.
Right? ... and Valdez?
<i>He was there
when the Titanic went down.</i>
This was a chance for me
to come to the last piece of pristine...
untouched wilderness on the planet
before we fuck it up.
So if North... is willing to pay me
to be here, then so be it.
Maxwell, you're on my team.
 Here we go, Pipe Dogs, here we go 
 Here we go, Pipe Dogs 
- Hey, Dawn! Dawn!
- Yeah?
<i>- You're gonna be my center over here!
- Okay. You got it.</i>
Maxwell. I think we're
gonna call you "House" out here.
What do you think of that, Maxwell?
That's okay, Mr. Pollack.
- You can call me Ed. All right, House?
- Yes, sir.
When do I say "hike"?
You're gonna go to the right.
You're gonna go to the left.
- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!
Hut, hut, hut!
I don't even know the fucking rules.
Run, House, run!
Go!
Get him!
- Yeah!
- Gimme some love, bro.
- Yeah!
- I got it!
- You can't kick to yourself!
Go! Run!
It's all right.
He's down. He's down.
Right here! We're here! All right, we're here.
Flag on the play.
Get off me!
Hike!
1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi,
3 Mississippi, 4 Mississippi!
I got it!
- Yes!
- Whoo!
Yeah, baby!
What happened?
Hike!
<i>Out! Go long! Go long!</i>
You're a tough
little woman, I'll give you that.
Back! Back!
That's pass interference, Elliot!
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
I didn't see you. The ball...
Are you okay, Elliot?
<i>Okay, okay. Step aside,
House, let's have a look.</i>
<i>- Aw, jeez.
- Oh, fuck.</i>
He just took a little elbow.
Just got a little blood.
Hey, Dawn?
Let's get him inside
and get him fixed up, okay?
All right, come on. Bring him up slow.
<i>Okay.</i>
All right, you're going to be all right.
<i>떰</i>
<i> My baby don't care for shows </i>
<i> My baby don't care for clothes </i>
<i> My baby Just cares for me </i>
<i> My baby don't care for </i>
<i> Cars and races </i>
<i> My baby don't care for </i>
<i> High-tone places </i>
<i> Liz Taylor is not her style </i>
<i> And even Lana Turner's smile </i>
<i> Something you can't see </i>
<i> My baby don't care who knows </i>
<i> My baby Just cares for me </i>
<i>떰</i>
You okay?
Yep.
Ready for the big meeting today?
Sure.
What's it about?
Well, he flew in to talk to you, basically.
Sounds ominous.
You think everything is ominous.
Wasn't this supposed to be
a one-night stand a month ago?
I think you should
hear him out, you know?
He's got a lot riding on this.
This is not a fair conversation.
Let's go, Ab.
I- I'll be right there.
Come on, he must know.
I'm not so sure.
He sees what he wants to see.
Hey, man.
I got your stuff.
Thanks.
It's weird. You almost don't need
your gear, right?
Yeah, right.
We just, uh, take it, just in case.
Hey, have you ever been
out to the KIK well?
Yeah.
I mean, yeah. It's that box.
I mean, I go by it on my way to site 7.
Right.
What's under there?
A pipe?
With a valve on it?
Why?
What's under that?
What?
Nothing.
Wait, you saw the... the...
you know, the North video?
They talked about it.
Yeah. I watched it. Yeah.
Yeah. Whatever.
I mean, I'm gone for what, five weeks?
And she hooks up with this guy?
I mean, Jesus.
I thought Abby was smarter than that.
Hoffman's cool. He's a sharp dude.
I saw some of his articles.
It's some deep shit, man.
It put me right to sleep.
It's just... It's just
bad judgment on Abby's part,
you know what I'm saying?
She's too young for you, man.
Hey, take it easy, will you?
<i>Hoffman heading out.</i>
How long have they been
at it, Abby and him?
I don't know, man. Ask her.
Hand me that Allen wrench,
will you, boss?
How long?
Three to four weeks.
It won't last. I'll tell you that much.
I guess he just got lucky.
Here's his thing, you know,
if you want to check it out.
Yeah, this guy's seen it all, hasn't he?
That's him.
Thanks for the Allen wrench,
by the way.
I mean, North thinks
they can win a PR campaign,
hiring greenies to do
the impact statements.
It's a waste of money, you know?
The public is with us on this.
They can see the potential.
They don't need to get bogged down
with a lot of hand wringing.
He thinks there's something off-kilter
going on out here.
Is that what he's telling everybody?
Yeah, the permafrost is melting.
That's what he says.
Haven't you smelled it?
Fucking dick.
<i>Saturday, week 9.</i>
<i>Radical temperature rises
continues from last week.</i>
<i>Since blizzard of February 7th,</i>
<i>low of 15 Fahrenheit.</i>
<i>Temperature on consistent rise</i>
<i>with seven day
average of 31 degrees.</i>
<i>High of 36 on February 12th.</i>
<i>Anecdotal weather
fluctuations continue,</i>
<i>with consistent sub-surface warming.</i>
Ground reading's 3 to 7 degrees
increase over same week.
Same quadrant average of last five years.
It's you again.
Mess up all my stuff, hmm?
Is that you?
<i>- Beggar.
- Something up here is off.</i>
<i>It's in the numbers, but also I can feel it.</i>
Maxwell, over.
I don't know why they don't
just lay tarmac down
at the start of these projects
instead of fucking around
with these ice roads.
That would be a violation of the terms
that got North Industries onto this land.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, my only concern
is getting my equipment in.
My only recommendation is that we wait
for a sustained temperature drop.
I'll tell you what.
Change of plans.
We're gonna bring the rigs in on rollagons.
Rollagons?
Has that been approved?
Everybody's behind it back at the office.
Nobody wants to miss the season.
That's going to be very expensive.
Rollagons would cause
serious damage to the tundra
with the temperatures this high.
Well, luckily I don't have to have this
discussion with you.
I need Hoffman. Where the fuck is he?
I don't know.
He was coming right back.
Well, I need for him to sign off on this.
This is what I came back here for.
We should be careful
how we handle that.
Hey, Motor, what's up?
We're a little busy here.
Maxwell's not back yet. I'm worried.
The Ski-Doo is acting up.
Maybe it copped out on him.
Hey, Abby, what's going on?
Where the hell have you been?
Maxwell's not back.
He's not answering the walkie.
He's not answering?
Do you need any help?
I wouldn't worry about Maxwell.
The kid could walk from here
to Vegas on his hands.
- Maxwell, do you read?
- Where have you been?
So you guys didn't get
any kind of a sudden wind down here?
Anything strange like that happen?
Yeah.
Yeah, we had a meeting,
and you never showed up.
That was strange.
Lee, let's go!
Look, I am sorry about being late.
We need to talk, you and me.
We don't need the others.
Hoffman, I don't know you,
and I'm not going to try to handle this
with some diplomatic mumbo jumbo.
I'm just going to tell you what I need,
and I'm going to expect you to deliver.
Go ahead.
I got environmental impact statements
I need you to sign,
saying we can bring
the rigs in a rollagons.
What?
The ice roads aren't working.
It's what we gotta do.
<i>Okay.</i>
What, is that a yes?
I'll look at your proposal.
It's not a proposal.
It's an okay I need you to sign.
Ed, I'm not going to sign something
just because you need me to.
I think we should make
sure Maxwell's back safe
before we get into this.
Foster, yeah, he's not biting.
Yeah. Yeah?
We should go through with that.
There you go.
You should call her.
I just tried. Nothing.
These things ever work?
Maxwell was bound to get lost eventually.
Is that right?
He seems overwhelmed.
This whole damn operation
needs an attitude adjustment.
It's unacceptable.
Go ahead.
Hello?
Pollack here.
Hoffman?
No, he's here.
Yeah. Hang on.
Hoffman!
Hoffman!
Foster's on the line.
Make it quick, will you?
Hello.
I'm good.
Really?
Just like that?
Tuesday. Fine.
I'll be out of here.
Visibility is turning to shit out there!
We checked his route,
he abandoned his Ski-Doo.
What?
It started up fine.
He is out there on foot.
Where's his Ski-Doo?
Didn't want to leave him stranded.
We gotta call a plane for a real search.
No way! No way!
That'd mean we'd have
to wait until morning.
No, we do this ourselves,
and we do it now!
I'm not losing a man!
I'm going out there now.
I'll go with you.
Jesus.
House!
You had everybody's
panties in a knot, man.
Hey, are you all right?
I'm... I'm okay.
I- I don't think this works.
According to this thing,
you walked 300 miles.
We looked for you.
So you got lost. I mean, what happened?
- Hot tea.
- Welcome back, man.
You gotta stay in contact, all right?
Let somebody know where you're going.
Standard procedure.
And never, ever turn your walkie off.
It wasn't working.
It was just screeching at me.
Sorry. I'm gonna go lie down.
That boy has got big eye.
He hasn't been out here long enough.
He'll be fine.
They're calling it a promotion.
Can they even do this?
<i>Of course they can.</i>
You don't like the message,
you get a new messenger.
I'm gonna quit.
You should stay on.
Take some notes on this new guy.
You're giving up pretty easy.
Look, man, I've been reporting
on this stuff a long time.
People just don't want to deal with it.
It's tiring.
<i> I won't tell you
I don't need you tonight </i>
<i> Won't pretend I ain't burning inside </i>
<i> Your skin glowing soft
in the silver moonlight </i>
That was intense.
What's up with you?
I'm leaving.
They're pulling me off the project.
I didn't know if you knew.
Why weren't you at that meeting today?
I'm gonna recommend that
they shut the project down.
I don't think they can get those rigs out.
Jim, it's too late for that.
How's Maxwell?
Try to get some food in him, will you?
Work some of your magic.
I figure, take him out here first.
We tell him we're gonna get
the rigs in here in nine days.
They're gonna stay until March,
I don't know, 19th,
and then we're gonna get them over
to the Northeastern site.
I mean, you know, we just tell him that,
you know, like it's a done deal.
Yeah, well, you tell him that, Ed.
I mean, Jesus.
I'll handle him.
Is this...
Is this Maxwell flagging these sits?
What is he, sniffing glue out here or what?
I don't know what this is.
Jesus.
We're gonna have to check
all these sites now.
Yeah, okay.
Lee, this is going to be you.
All of them.
Will do.
Excuse me.
You're gonna have your
work cut out for you.
Yeah, I think this is going
to take more than one of us.
Better you than me.
<i>Oh, nature calls.</i>
So, Hoffman, what do you figure,
we bring the rigs in here on rollagon?
Is that gonna work?
The tundra is barely frozen.
It won't support the weight
of those vehicles.
Well, now...
how do you propose we get
the equipment in here, then?
Maybe you won't get it in.
Maybe you're gonna have
to reconsider your plans.
That's the wrong answer.
<i>It's the CO2 feeding back up.</i>
As the ground warms,
permafrost, all this organic material
that's been frozen for thousands
of years is thawing,
which accelerates the warming.
It's exponential,
what we're talking about here.
What is this, some
global warming bullshit?
I mean, don't you think
it's a little late in the day
to be having that particular debate?
It's not a debate
about global warming, Ed.
It's just what we're
dealing with out here now.
Yeah, well, fortunately,
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
You asked.
Just making conversation.
<i>"Empathy with the land.</i>
<i>Is this learned in childhood?"</i>
<i>"The land is changed.</i>
<i>"The biosphere turned,
become unfamiliar and erratic.</i>
<i>"I would say vengeful,</i>
<i>"but nature's indifferent to us.</i>
<i>"We fight for our survival, not nature's.</i>
<i>"There's a fierceness in the wind
I've never felt before.</i>
<i>"Something is being unleashed
from the softening permafrost.</i>
<i>"Why do we despise the world
that give us life?</i>
<i>Why so alienated?"</i>
<i>"Why wouldn't the wilderness fight us,</i>
<i>"like any other organism
would fend off a virus?</i>
<i>"The world we grew up in
is changed forever.</i>
<i>There is no way home. "</i>
<i>"Is there something beyond science</i>
<i>"that is happening out here?</i>
<i>"What if the very thing
we were here to pull out of the ground</i>
<i>"were to rise willingly and confront us?</i>
<i>"What would that look like?</i>
<i>"This is the last winter.</i>
<i>Total collapse. "</i>
<i>"Hope dies. "</i>
Something happening, Dawn.
That's brilliant! Do that again!
<i>Very Twilight Zone.</i>
Would either of you like
to comment on the fact
that it's fucking raining out,
February in the Arctic?
I'm freaking, man.
<i>- Uginaca.
- What's that, Dawn?</i>
Well, it means like a familiar friend
acting strangely.
It's how we speak of weather.
It gets worse every year.
What's happening?
What do you say about it, Hoffman?
The climate's changing exponentially.
It's collapsing. It's altering.
I'm talking about
right now, today, what happened?
That's what I'm talking about, today.
It was rain.
For Christ's sake, the temperature's
already dropping back.
It was a fluke.
Well?
He's staring out the window.
He say anything?
No.
Did you tell him I said it was dinnertime?
Yep.
Send him home, Ed.
That's what I say.
He's not going anywhere.
Well, if he doesn't eat, he can't work.
I realize... Jesus Christ.
Can I get a little fucking positivity here?
And wipe your face.
You're pathetic.
You do realize that there are restrictions
on alcohol consumptions
at this station, don't you?
And what about you?
Would you pass a piss test?
And where do you think you're going?
Let him try, Ed.
Yeah. House likes him.
May I come in?
Yeah.
I brought you this.
What happened out there yesterday?
When we lost you?
I don't know.
<i>Out by the KIK well...</i>
it's haunted.
All right. Just... take a deep breath
down on that one there, Maxwell.
We shouldn't be here.
We're grave robbers.
It's coming up from the ground.
Ghosts.
I mean, what is oil anyway but fossils?
Plants and animals from...
whatever... millions of years ago.
Listen. Maxwell.
That's...
Maybe...
this has gotten to be
a little too much for you.
It's pretty intense out here.
You can go home.
Have you thought of that?
I can't.
My... my parents would kill me.
Your parents aren't going to kill you.
It was my father's
idea for me to be here.
Satisfy my love of the outdoors
by drilling for oil with Uncle Ed.
Well, maybe your father would listen
if you explained to him.
Have you thought about that?
Man...
eat some food.
I'm telling you!
There's something out there
<i>- that's trying to drive us out of here!
- Okay...</i>
It's like a force, fighting back!
- Maxwell, you gotta...
- No! People need to know! Isn't that your job?
To let people know what the fuck
they're supposed to do here?
What the hell is going on?
- Tell them! Tell them what you know!
- Hey!
- Calm down! You, get the fuck out of here!
- You know what's happening!
You know! You've said things!
- You know what's going on...
- Calm down!
You gonna calm the fuck down?
Yes, sir.
Just need...
I need to rest.
Sorry.
He's resting.
Dawn's got him on something.
What the hell was that in there?
I got Maxwell out here, you know.
Told his old man how good
it would be for him.
Known that kid since the day he was born.
I know, Ed.
It's Hoffman!
I have no idea how you ended up in
the sack with that guy.
But I gotta tell ya,
I consider it a security breach.
We had nothing to hide, Ed.
Everything is by the book.
He works for North.
Every report he does goes through us.
I think you made a big mistake
transferring him out of here.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let him
or anybody else fuck this up for me!
I had his confidence.
I had my eye on him.
You let me down, Abby.
I did not, Ed.
I mean personally.
I guess that's over with.
Yeah, it is.
Good night.
Sure hope you don't like
the new guy as much.
- Who you got?
- Hmm.
Marshowitz.
Abby.
I'm tired.
Maxwell...
saw something out there.
Something's going on here.
Don't think you need
to get involved with Maxwell.
We'll take care of him.
That sounds ominous.
You know, you're getting awfully vocal
about what we're doing up here.
It's not gonna work with Pollack.
You should've just signed
those impact reports.
Pollack has no idea
what's going on out here.
<i>- Oh, and you do?
- No, I don't, either.</i>
That's why I'd like to
take a giant step backwards
and get some people up here
who can figure out what is going on.
You know your deal with North prohibits you
from saying anything
about this to anyone.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just need to make that clear.
Abby!
You don't feel that something is off here?
Listen, Abby.
You can make a real difference here.
Draw a line in the sand.
If they shut this project down,
the others could be called into question.
You could be part of
a change for the better.
Take your case to North, if you need to.
At this station, we're fighting
to get those rigs in.
Whatever it takes, and on schedule.
What's been going on with us
these last three weeks?
I gotta sleep.
This is on the fritz, too.
We gotta do something to get these systems
up and running, Motor.
I fix stuff around here.
Two hours later, it's broke again.
Maybe we need to get somebody
down here who could figure this shit out.
Hey. Look at this.
How's he doing?
What is this now?
There's my camera, man!
We should thaw the fucker out
and see if he shot anything with it.
God damn it!
Where was he?
Up by the KIK well.
You should have send him home, Ed.
You should have sent him the fuck home!
We'd better call and report this.
- Radio's dead.
- We wait until morning!
Foster's flying in here with what's-his-name.
We get Maxwell flown out by Gary.
That's final!
<i>Ever since I got here,</i>
<i>I could tell that there
was something wrong.</i>
<i>Not the Job. Not the cold.
Not being isolated.</i>
<i>But feeling... how?</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>
<i>I've seen something out in the snow.</i>
<i>I want to show you.</i>
Jesus. What's he doing?
<i>Do you see it?</i>
<i>Did you see it?</i>
<i>Did you see it?</i>
<i>Up ahead. They're out now.</i>
<i>Listen! Listen! That!</i>
<i>It...</i>
<i>Dad, do you hear that?</i>
<i>Listen!</i>
<i>Do you see it, Dad?</i>
<i>They're out there!</i>
<i>They're right out there!</i>
<i>You see... you see that?</i>
<i>Do you see it? Do you see it?</i>
All right. That's it.
Ed...
Ed!
You can't burn that!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Ed! Ed!
I'm in charge here!
And that tape does nobody any good!
Back off, Pollack!
You want his parents to see that?
Is that what you want?
Their kid whacked out?
Wandering around in his birthday suit?
You're out of your mind.
That was evidence, Pollack.
There'll be an investigation!
He wandered off,
and he died of exposure!
Did you hear what he was saying?
You're on the next plane outta here, Elliot!
You and Hoffman! Until then,
you stay out of my way!
We should all be on that plane, Ed.
And what did you put
in his head last night?
Elliott, your nose. Come on. Get inside.
Get inside.
Go, go, go, go, go. Come on.
What do you say, Lee?
<i>Is it the coming of the shinu?</i>
<i>Shinu?</i>
<i>A shinu is a dark spirit.</i>
Sometimes called...
<i>wendigo.</i>
What do you say, Lee?
I believe...
what I see with my own eyes.
God damn it!
Motor.
What are you doing, man?
I have to check the engine.
Just... think... I think...
we might have to get out of here.
Yeah. Yeah. I understand.
Listen, man. Listen.
<i>It's cold out here. Okay?</i>
You should go inside, okay?
- Your hands...
- My hands are fine.
I'm... can hardly feel 'em.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking maybe you ought
to lay off the hooch just a little bit.
'Cause you're not
thinking so straight.
Look, I'm... I'm headin' down south.
After this winter, I'm...
I've had it. I'm outta here.
I need to talk to you.
Can it wait?
No.
Maxwell's father...
is a friend of mine.
I lost his kid on my watch.
I know. I'm sorry.
It wasn't your fault.
Well, I'm responsible.
For this crew, and everything
that happens to 'em.
Your sorry ass included.
Well, then do the responsible thing
and let's get everybody out of here tonight.
Why? 'Cause you say so?
Because it's not safe.
I think there's
an atmospheric abnormality here
that's affecting everyone's judgment.
I think that's what
happened to Maxwell.
Now Motor is out there
not making any sense, either.
- Don't you start any new shit.
- Look.
It's some sort of low-level sour gas.
It's seeping up out of the ground.
H2S is a half a mile
under the earth's surface.
It doesn't just seep
out of the ground, for Christ's sake.
Do you even know what the fuck
you're talking about?
I say it does. This
permafrost is melting.
Somehow, this hydrogen
sulfide's making its way to the surface
- like a low-level blowout.
- Bullshit!
All right, well.
Then it's some kind of contagion.
<i>Or a virus. Or spores.
I don't know! All right?</i>
I don't know.
But I do know that this
ground's been frozen
for the last 10,000 years.
We have no idea
what's coming out of it.
Do you even realize
you're putting everybody
at risk with this kind of talk?
Have another drink, Pollack.
Fuck you.
I got a series of alarmist ideas.
The warming is melting the tundra.
But then you are worried
about a whole sour gas scenario.
You haven't made yourself clear!
Well, it's a lot of factors.
<i>Okay? All at once.</i>
None of which I fully
understand at this point.
But I think that we should err
on the side of caution.
Well, I can't make a run for it
based on a hunch.
I need evidence.
There's a corpse outside.
That's evidence of something.
Yeah. That's evidence
of a major malfunction
on Maxwell's part.
Well, you should know that Motor
is now totally freaking out.
He's taking apart the Snowcat.
What?
Look, we're all under
a lot of pressure out here.
You guys.
You guys, who?
You. And Pollack.
You're perfect for each other.
I can't email out of here.
You should be packing.
Listen, Elliott,
I want you to come down
to Fairbanks with me.
Staying here's just bullshit.
All right?
And dangerous.
<i>Listen. Listen...</i>
<i>Did you see it?</i>
<i>Did you see it?</i>
<i>They're out there.</i>
<i>Right out there.</i>
<i>Ghosts.</i>
<i>What is oil anyway but fossils?</i>
<i>Plants and animals from...
whatever. Millions of years ago?</i>
<i>We shouldn't be here.</i>
<i>We're grave robbers.</i>
<i>People need to know! Isn't that your Job?</i>
<i>I Just hope this isn't
happening everywhere else.</i>
Abby has decided...
in light of recent goings-on
that we should all ship out of here,
and get our heads checked.
I'm gonna second that motion
for the good of the team.
But make no mistake.
We're coming right back.
We're just gonna go to Deadhorse.
We're gonna get checked out there
in the infirmary.
I want everybody's bags packed.
Just the essentials.
Lee, I want you to go out
and tell Motor what's going on.
Foster and Marshowitz
will be here any minute.
Get Gary to radio for another plane.
It'll be fine.
<i>He is getting that age, right?</i>
Pollack is an animal.
He'll never retire.
He'd go crazy without this job.
My bottom line is he's...
he's just not delivering.
He's all right.
Hey, what about Abby?
What about her?
She's a piece of ass, right?
I got one of those, too.
Wind pick up, Gary?
Doesn't look like
it has a whole crew, huh, Marshowitz?
Ugly as sin out here.
It's pure white nothingness.
It looks like the last place on Earth.
God's country.
North country.
Down!
Down! Down!
<i>Oh, my God! Gary!</i>
See if you can get inside!
Foster!
Foster, are you with me?
Can I get on the other side?
Fuck.
Hang on, pal.
Maxwell? How the fuck
did you get over here?
Ed, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Where's Gary?
Did he make it out of there?
Couldn't get him out!
Jesus Christ.
We gotta get Foster out of there!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Pull him out! Pull him out!
Easy, guys. Easy.
Lee, I need that fire out now!
Foster. Foster! Stay with me!
Give me the morphine! Come on!
- All right. Let him have it.
That's it.
Hang in there, brother.
<i>- Okay.
- Hang in there.</i>
You're gonna be all right. Hang on.
It's all right, buddy.
Fucking Gary...
Fucking Gary. Right, man.
We gotta stop the bleeding.
See the liver right here.
You gotta get us out of here.
You gotta get us out.
There's no heat.
No electricity.
I have to get some plastic or...
some tarps over these walls...
and move everybody back
through the kitchen...
into Dawn's room.
If they haven't heard
from us by tomorrow,
they'll send another plane.
We can hold out till then.
I don't think so.
What?
There's one snowmobile working.
I could take it to Fort Crow.
Fort Crow? What are you talking about?
It's an Inuit village
19 miles southwest of here.
Is the gas in the tank?
It's full.
No, no, we're not leaving the station.
If we stay here, we could
all be dead in the morning.
He's right, Ed.
It's... 25 miles
to the ice road camps.
It's a flat route.
They're working today.
It's 9:20. They'll be there until 5.
That's what we'll do.
We'll hook up with these guys
and we'll radio for help,
and we'll have somebody
here by nightfall.
I'll go to Fort Crow.
It's closer. They'll have a plane.
It's North's equipment.
We're gonna do it North's way.
If you want to come along,
that'd be fine.
We could use your help.
Two of us doubles our chances.
We better get going.
It's a straight shot!
Straight shot.
Keep this on channel 3.
Yeah.
It should work for a while.
See you tonight.
Abby, you're in charge.
Stay strong, everybody.
We'll be back with help.
Won't leave you guys here.
You see that?
What did I tell you?
Hey!
Anybody here?
Supposed to be here. This is...
This is Tuesday, isn't it?
All day.
What is going on?
God damn it.
Hey!
No juice at all.
Must have got a ride out of here.
Well?
There's a pumping station
about 25 miles west of here.
No, Ed. Fort Crow
is about 8 or 9 miles south of here.
Ed! Fort Crow is gonna save our ass!
Uhh!
Come on! Fucking piece of shit!
Pollack! Pollack!
What?
We lost all our oil.
She's not gonna start.
Fuck!
All right, Ed, listen.
Fort Crow is 9 miles
south of here, maybe 10.
We got three hours of daylight left.
Let's not squander it.
9 miles.
<i>Out there on foot.</i>
God damn it.
He's gone.
Let's cover him up.
Where's Lee?
Pollack! You see that ridge?
Fort Crow is on the other side.
River around here somewhere.
What are you doing?
Think he was one of those drivers?
From the ice road?
Pollack!
Pollack!
Hang on!
Hang on, Pollack!
Pollack!
My foot!
The belt!
Can you grab it?
That's it.
All right.
Hang on a second!
Pull! Pull!
Fuck!
Get it!
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.
I can't do it.
Yes, you can. Come on, Pollack.
We gotta get off this ice.
It's not stable.
Come on. Come on.
Come on!
All right. You're doing great!
You're doing great.
Come on, we gotta get this off.
- Shit!
- Ah, fuck, man!
My boot.
- Forget about the boot.
- I gotta go get my boot.
No! Forget about the boot, Pollack!
The boot's gone.
Boot's gone.
We gotta get those clothes off you.
Thanks, man.
Fucking...
I'm fucking burning up.
No, you're not, you're freezing.
Keep moving, keep moving!
You're gonna make it.
Let's go. Here we go.
<i>Okay.</i>
Come on.
Atta boy.
Take it easy with that stuff.
It doesn't mix well with hypothermia.
We could die out here.
That gonna be a boot?
Yep.
Anyway, I...
Well, anyway...
You know.
You and Abby.
I guess I get it.
She's a...
She means a lot to me.
I guess we had our go at it.
She's a handful.
Believe in God?
No.
Not the way you mean.
Jesus Christ, Jim.
I would not do what you've
chosen to do up here.
Whatever god it is that sanctions that,
then no.
I'm not a believer.
What's needed out here is a pipeline
and a base camp...
and a couple of wells.
That's what God wants.
Lee!
Dawn.
Dawn?
Dawn!
Dawn?
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Oh, my God! Motor!</i>
Motor?
Motor!
Motor!
Dawn, what did you do?
Motor!
Motor!
Dawn!
What's wrong with you?
Dawn!
No!
Motor.
God.
Dawn!
Dawn!
Listen up.
This is how it's gotta go.
I want your boots.
What?
I'm in charge here,
and that's the decision.
What is it?
Hoffman, what is it?
I can't tell.
It's wind!
Enough of this shit!
You got into Maxwell's head,
but you're not getting into mine.
Now I'm not afraid of this place!
You see it? Do you see it?
Do you see it?
Hoffman, you are as crazy
as a shithouse rat.
Now I'm going for help.
and help is over that rock.
We gotta stick together.
We can't split up.
We have no idea what we're dealing with here.
We gotta watch each others' back.
You gotta calm down, man!
Look!
<i>Open your eyes!</i>
I don't see anything!
Look!
The boot! Gimme the boot!
<i>Open your eyes!</i>
Crazy bastard, you're making me do this!
Hoffman, are you there?
Hoffman, are you there?
<i>Abby?</i>
Jim? Are you okay?
<i>I'm a... I'm a...</i>
I'm okay.
<i>Where's Pollack?</i>
Uh, he took off.
I'm alone.
Me, too.
<i>All right. Well, Just hang on.</i>
<i>I'm so close.</i>
<i>I'm so close.</i>
<i>We're gonna get out of this, Jim.</i>
You know, daylight's coming,
and they're gonna
send somebody for us,
so we're gonna get out of this.
<i>You're gonna get out,</i>
<i>and you're gonna tell the
whole world what happened.</i>
You're going to sound the alarm.
You're going to tell the whole world.
And people are gonna
rise up, make change.
Hell, they might build you a monument.
Yeah.
The whole world's gonna
band together, Jim.
<i>There it is, Abby! Abby!</i>
<i>I can... I can see the town.</i>
<i>We're... We're gonna be okay.</i>
<i>Just hold on.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
Jim, what's happening?
<i>It's Pollack. I think he's fallen.</i>
Is he... is he alive?
<i>Abby?</i>
Jim.
<i>I can't tell if this is happening.</i>
Jim?
Jim, what's happening?
Jim!
Jim!
Jim!
Shoot it!
Town's right over there!
What are you waiting for?
Mom, I'm home!
No!
<i>Let's take a look at the big picture.</i>
<i>We have got a lot to talk about.</i>
<i>Mother Nature outdoing herself right now.</i>
<i>Let's take a look up north.</i>
<i>The folks in Buffalo
are watching snow come down today.</i>
<i>Today they had snow,</i>
<i>but yesterday, a record high of 67 degrees.</i>
<i>So how do you deal
with those weather swings in Buffalo?</i>
<i>Mood swings as well, I bet.</i>
<i>Down in Florida, of course,</i>
<i>we've still got that recovery effort going on
for the flooding last week.</i>
<i>We've got some video here.</i>
<i>This is, I believe,
Durgin Street in Ormond Beach.</i>
<i>Wow, those folks Just
really taking a pounding.</i>
<i>Now we got a couple of storms
up and down the East Coast,</i>
<i>some flash flooding, and of course,</i>
<i>Cape Cod is hit with
another big winter storm</i>
<i>that almost split through the bay.</i>
<i>While that's going on,
we've got bright sunshine</i>
<i>out in Atlanta, and Phoenix as well.</i>
<i>It hit 79 in Phoenix.</i>
<i>That's a record for this time of year.</i>
<i>Spring dropping in a little early.</i>
<i>Now, out in Seattle, this is something.</i>
<i>Seattle. We're getting reports...</i>
<i>this is no exaggeration...
of hail earlier this morning.</i>
<i>In some places,
hail reported the size of baseballs.</i>
<i>For all you Mariners fans
who've Joined us,</i>
<i>that's one for the record books as well.</i>
<i>So we've got something for you
wherever you are in the country.</i>
<i>Now, here's something
that's got folks scratching their heads.</i>
<i>Anchorage, Alaska, 68 degrees...</i>
<i>In Fairbanks, 71.</i>
<i>That's correct.
All up and down the state,</i>
<i>they're dealing with record highs.</i>
<i>It's caused a lot of problems
for the folks up there.</i>
<i>They're used to some very bitter winters,</i>
<i>and a lot of people
scratching their heads...</i>
<i> Tomorrow is gone yesterday </i>
<i> Silly to try and run faster </i>
<i> There's nowhere you can go, I'm afraid </i>
<i> There's nothing left past here </i>
<i> Runnin' out of road </i>
<i> We're Just runnin' out of road </i>
<i> And from that look
there on your face </i>
<i> I can tell you've been cryin' </i>
<i> Here in this cold light of day </i>
<i> There ain't no reason to deny it </i>
<i> No, no </i>
<i> Runnin' out of road </i>
<i> Ah we're Just runnin' out of road </i>
<i> Would a word on us two </i>
<i> Mean something more to you and me </i>
<i> If we could cut through our lies </i>
<i> And try to catch it in time? </i>
<i> There's a hole in this heart </i>
<i> But it goes right on beating </i>
<i> Someday I know it's gonna stop </i>
<i> Till then, I'll go right on breathing </i>
<i> Said I'm runnin' out of road </i>
<i> Said I'm runnin' out of road </i>
<i> Oh, said I'm runnin' out of road </i>
<i> Runnin' out of </i>
<i> Runnin' out of
runnin' out of road </i>
<i> I'm runnin' out of road </i>
<i> I'm runnin' out of road </i>
