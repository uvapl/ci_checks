Lila! Lila! Lila!
Do you think this will affect
the sales of your book?
-Lila, are you sorry you did it?
-I'm not sorry.
I am sorry.
I don`t even know
what sorry means anymore.
I'm not sorry.
So I spend the rest of
my life in jail. So what?
I've been in jail
my whole life anyway.
A jail of blood and tissue...
and coursing hormones.
A called the human body.
The only thing I know
is that I'm sorry.
Sorry for my expulsion. Sorry for
my Lila rotting in her jail cell.
And sorry for Nathan...
rotting in his grave.
I don`t even know what
sorry means anymore.
lt`s odd.
When I was alive, I knew.
Maybe it was all I knew.
But here...
sorry is meaningless.
Love is meaningless.
-Jealousy is meaningless.
-My story begins when I was 1 2.
Jesus.
Something terrible happened
that year.
My mother said because of it, l
would never be able to get a man.
So I should get used to the idea of
dedicating my life to the pursuit...
of knowledge or religion
or whatever.
lt`s hormonal. Nature is
a funny and complex thing.
lt could get worse with time.
By the time I was 20,
l looked like an ape.
The way that mouse looked at me.
lt didn`t care if I had hair
all over my body.
l was just what I was.
l felt so free.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
Something about a mouse, right?
l don`t think there`s anyone in
the world who doesn`t know...
by now that I was raised
in the wilderness by an ape.
Well, to be fair, by a man who
thought himself an ape. But...
it amounts to the same thing,
gentlemen, does it not?
After spending years in a mental
hospital for attempting to...
take up residence in the ape
house of the local zoo...
he did his best to live by your
rules. He got a job...
he married a human,
they had me.
Until a national tragedy undid
all those years of therapy...
and reminded him what the
human race was truly about.
Apes don`t assassinate their
presidents, gentlemen.
So, he stole little me
from my human mother...
and raised me with love and
tenderness and respect.
Until quite recently gentlemen,
l believed myself to be an ape.
Although, I didn`t know
specifically what type.
Apes don`t think in terms of type.
lt might be argued, gentlemen...
that apes don`t even know
they`re apes.
ln retrospect, however,
l`d say I was a...
pygmy chimp.
l have to say
l always hated apes.
Of course, I don`t any longer.
Now I don`t even know
what hate means.
But while alive, I hated apes.
l blame my parents.
l mean, I don`t blame them.
l don`t know what blame is
really, anymore, but...
l think they influenced me
in my ape-hating tendencies.
Mama, look! Monkey!
Nathan, chimpanzees are apes,
not monkeys.
And furthermore, Harold,
tell the boy.
Tell him, Harold.
The ape is our closest
biological relative.
Specifically...
the pygmy chimp.
A single chromosome separates us.
But do you know what...
-truly separates us?
-No, Papa, what?
Civilization. Without it, we
might as well be living in pens...
throwing our feces...
masturbating in public, sniffing
red, swollen female rump.
Your adoptive father and l
whisked you away from a life...
that most certainly would`ve been
one of degradation and alcoholism.
Your part of the bargain is
to never wallow...
in the filth of instinct.
Any dumb animal can do that.
An animal saved my life...
so I decided to go live
among them in the forest.
You see, animals have eyes
that don`t judge.
Look at all the hair,
everywhere, everywhere.
On the possum and the woodchuck
and the cuddly old bear.
l used to be embarrassed of hair.
Not fit to caress.
Now, I'm so sure
it`s a blessing...
I've got no need of dressing.
I once thought God
A Creator diabolical
He gave the nod
To each one of my follicles
Head to my baby toe
Now I`m free
No more cares
I`ve accepted
My millions of hairs
My new friends
These split ends
Far away from
Those terrible stares
Squirrels don`t mind
Nor do ravens
If a girl is furred
Or clean-shaven
Creatures are kind so I have
Found my new green haven
And I ain`t gonna go
`Cause I`m one of them
You know
l figured out a way to stay
in the woods forever.
l became a nature writer.
Last night, on my mountaintop...
l felt the wind whip
through my hair.
lt was violent.
l almost died.
All my petty concerns were sent
flying with those gale force winds.
l was in nature.
l was nature!
An otter, a stork, an oak tree.
A woman.
When I became a famous nature
writer, I said to myself...
``Fuck humanity.`` I never saw my
public, I never saw my publisher.
l never saw another human being
and it was wonderful.
But I have to admit by the time
l was 30, I was very horny.
l had to have a man in my life.
l would become what I needed
to become to achieve this.
My success would allow me to
afford to become a hairless lie.
-Progress!
-Yeah?
Yeah. Honey, you are getting
smooth, smooth, smooth all over.
-Smooth as a baby`s butt.
-l love it, Louise.
-I'm getting like a real girl.
-You still in the market for...
-a real boy?
-Always.
`Cause my brother knows this guy.
Might be right up your alley.
Tell me. I could use
someone up my alley.
l don`t get that.
Something sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
-Handsome, 30`s, psychologist.
-Loves animals?
-Must love animals, Louise.
-Loves animals. Loves you.
What do you mean?
Well, somehow it came up that
you`re a friend of mine...
and Mr. Handsome Animal-loving
Psychologist said...
-that he would love to meet you.
-Won`t he be able to tell?
My brother says the guy`s a
35-year-old virgin.
So, maybe he won`t know how
a woman usually feels.
Plus, he has bad eyesight.
Almost legally blind.
Which is very helpful in this
situation. Plus...
he has an extremely small penis of
which he is mortifyingly ashamed.
And chances are...
he will be so grateful for any
non-judgmental attention...
-he will be yours forever.
-He must be really close...
to your brother to tell him
such personal stuff.
Oh, yeah.
My brother`s his shrink.
-Fuck Humanity`s a delightful read.
-Thank you so much.
-Yes, I'm a real animal lover.
-l work with animals.
Right now...
I'm teaching mice...
well...
table manners, to be candid.
-And how`s it going?
-l hope you don`t think me daft.
lt`s important work. lt`s part of
a larger sociological experiment.
-I'm federally funded.
-What`s the larger experiment?
My thesis is that courtesy,
decorum, manners are all...
sadly lacking from our daily
intercourse. Rudeness and...
vulgarity are the norm. Ergo,
if I can teach table manners...
to mice, then I can
teach them to humans.
And if I can teach table manners
to humans, then maybe... I can...
make the world
a little bit safer.
Lord, thank You for this bountiful
gift we are about to receive.
Amen.
Oh, God, Nathan. No.
That`s the wrong fork, young man.
Harold, tell him.
-lt`s the wrong fork.
-I'm sorry.
l`ll use the right one.
l forgot.
Harold.
Tell him.
lt`s too late.
You`ll have to go to your room.
And do you think, maybe, this...
early childhood indoctrination
has something to do with...
your interest in table manners
in the present?
Seems a tad convenient,
don`t you think, Wendall?
Well, do you have any thoughts
then on where this passion...
-might`ve come from?
-lt`s my work.
You can`t reduce my passion
to parental indoctrination.
Why did Picasso paint?
Why did Mozart compose?
Picasso`s father was a painter.
Mozart`s father was a musician.
Yes, okay. Now you`re being nasty.
Now you`re just showing off.
l really didn`t come
here to be mocked.
Well, that certainly
wasn`t my intention.
lt`s my work, Wendall.
That`s all.
Voil?
This looks wonderful.
You look wonderful.
I'm on top of the world
tonight, Lila.
My work is going splendidly
and my personal life...
The fork. Fork!
I'm sorry?
lt`s just...the outside fork
is usually the salad fork.
-One goes from the outside in.
-Oh, I'm sorry. I never really...
-learned these things.
-lt`s no biggie.
Oh, boy, this is good.
-I'm sorry if I became upset.
-No, I'm sorry.
I'm a little backwards
in some ways.
lt`s just that I really
enjoy your company.
-You do?
-Yes.
Please, Lila.
Please don`t talk when
you have food in your mouth.
You`re so pretty,
and it only mars your....
I'm being critical.
l can`t believe
you think I'm pretty.
l have some peculiarities,
you see.
-l think you`re pretty, too.
-You do?
Yes, I really do. And I have
peculiarities, also.
Well, I don`t care. I don`t care.
-No?
-No.
Like what, for example?
Like.... Nothing.
l cannot believe how in love
with this man I am.
Louise, he`s so cute.
Even his little penis.
lt`s like a little pig`s penis
or something. lt`s charming.
Well, you`ve always
been an animal lover.
-He`s gonna find out, Lou.
-You`re a wonderful woman.
-He`s lucky to have you.
-Louise...
you`re removing hair from
my feet as you say that.
So you have a physical quirk.
Big deal.
l`ll tell you what I fall in love
with in a man...his mind, period.
-There`s a limit.
-No, period. End of sentence...
end of paragraph,
close the book, we`re done.
me a man with intellect,
like my brother.
l know he`s average looking,
but he`s so smart. You know?
l could care less
about the packaging.
-You don`t fuck the packaging.
-Yeah, you do.
You fuck the mind, Lila.
You fuck the mind, period.
Close the book, end the sentence,
close the whatever.
Hey. I have a really smart friend
for you. He has an l.Q. of 1 70.
-What`s he look like?
-Oh, he`s gorgeous.
-He`s sort of a midget.
-Jesus, Lila.
I'm not dating a fucking midget.
What is love anyway? From my new
vantage point, I realize that...
love is nothing more than a messy
conglomeration of need...
desperation, fear of death
and insecurity about penis size.
But I'm not judging it. I know
how miserable it is to be alive.
Listen...
l don`t want to be dead yet.
ls there any way to...
Hello?
No, I suppose not.
No biggie.
Anyway, Lila moved in.
We had our problems...
but we both wanted love so badly,
we turned a blind eye.
Like the first time I brought
Lila to meet my parents.
lt`s lovely to finally meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman.
Nathan`s told me so much about
you. All good things, of course.
Thank you, dear.
I'm sorry, will somebody please
tell me who this little boy is?
Your father and I have adopted
an additional son.
Wayne just returned
from a week at Peace Camp...
and a week at Science Camp. Tell
everyone what you`ve learned.
Conflict resolution and
flatworm dissection.
-Very nice to meet you, Wayne.
-Nice to meet you. Our mom`s...
-told me so much about you.
-Yes, I wish I could say the same.
By the way, his elbow
is on the table.
-Good boy.
-Good boy? That`s it? Good boy?
You shouldn`t be speaking to your
mother in that tone of voice.
Forgive me, but it seems to me that
Wayne needs a tad more disci--
Sorry, Mom.
l don`t know where my head was.
Wayne is quite
self-disciplined for his age.
-Meaning?
-He does seem very disciplined.
But I wonder, do you think it`s
the best thing for a child--
Lila`s a nature writer, Mother.
Did you know that?
She writes about animals and
nature and other things...
about nature in addition to that.
Wind, animals, what have you.
Squirrels.
l love nature.
As long as it stays in the zoo
where it belongs.
l hate Wayne. Don`t you?
Listen. I'm sorry about my
mother`s reaction to your work.
-What are you doing in there?
-You didn`t seem sorry when...
you were laughing at her endless
stupid, cruel animal jokes.
l was simply attempting to
keep the evening light.
You know I feel similarly
to you about nature.
-Do you?
-Oh, yes. Of course. I love it.
-Do you? Oh, do you, darling?
-lt`s my favorite, nature.
I'm so relieved.
Let`s celebrate tomorrow with
a long hike in the woods.
Oh, what a great idea.
That shaving cream?
l don`t think so.
Why?
Then, gentlemen, one day I saw
something I hadn`t seen since...
my father`s death.
l saw other apes.
They chattered away in
what seemed to be gibberish.
Later, I learned it was English.
Now I wonder if perhaps my initial
assessment hadn`t been correct.
l saw a flash of white.
-Did you see that?
-What?
-l don`t know. Something.
-A deer?
No, too upright.
A person?
lt might behoove us
to turn back at this point.
lf it`s a person,
why should we go see it?
lt`s not like it`s nature.
Lila, people who live in the
woods don`t want to be seen.
We should respect their wishes.
This is how you get ticks.
This is it. Lyme disease.
For God`s sake, what are you--
An ape as I had never seen before.
Like me, yet different.
And all at once I felt
a heat pass through me.
Gentlemen, I wanted to touch her,
caress her, to be one with her.
l had urges I could not explain.
And so I did what any animal
would do in that situation.
He bolted.
Who are you?
You don`t understand my
language, do you?
Now look what you`ve done.
ls he dead?
-No.
-Please put something on.
lt`s cold, you`ll catch a cold.
What do you suppose he is...
-a survivalist?
-l think he`s feral.
Feral? Oh, don`t touch him.
He might be diseased.
Oh, my God, rabies!
-He looks perfectly fine.
-My God, I think we should go.
Nathan, I don`t understand you.
This is fascinating.
Here`s a human being, totally
uncontaminated by civilization.
And all you want to
do is run to the car.
-You`re starting to annoy me.
-Forget the mice.
Forget guinea pigs.
Forget cats. Monkeys, too.
I'm on to stage five,
the human subject.
No.
l can change him.
l can teach him.
l can save this unfortunate
man`s life!
l won`t let you, it`s wrong.
He`s happy here.
Happy? ls he happy? Never to
know the love of a good woman.
Never to read Moby Dick
or marvel at a Monet.
You`d be taking away his freedom.
Freedom`s just another word
for nothing left to lose, Lila.
Doctor?
Good morning.
Only three shocks.
A chimp takes 15. This is going
to be trés simple, no, Gabrielle?
-Oui, doctor.
-Good morning.
-We need to give him a name.
-Oui.
-You decide. Today is your day.
-Really? My day?
l had a sweet little mongrel dog
named Puff when I was a girl.
Puff.
This one reminds me of my dog.
All shaggy. So cute.
l loved my doggie
very much, Monsieur.
Puff it is, then.
-Puff Bronfman. ls that okay?
-Oui, perfect.
Good morning, Puff Bronfman.
My name is Dr. Bronfman...
and this is my assistant,
Gabrielle.
We`re your mommy and
daddy while you`re here.
Would you like some salad, son?
-Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman!
-Hi, Gabrielle.
l just wanted to tell you that l
very much enjoy working with you.
Now I'm embarrassed
that I say this.
No, no. Don`t be.
l really enjoyed hearing that.
-You`re a terrific assistant.
-Merci.
Would you like to go
get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Well, I don`t know.
-Actually, I'm on my way to....
-Now I am truly embarrassed.
Forgive me. I should not have
asked such a stupid question.
-You`re a very important man.
-Don`t be silly.
You`re so sweet.
There, there.
You know just the right
thing to say to me.
l see you tomorrow, okay?
Unless.... Am I fired now?
No. Of course not, Gabrielle.
l like it when you say my name.
ls that stupid?
Hello?
Hi, Gabrielle.
-Yes, right, Gabrielle.
-Who is it?
-Who is it?
-Someone from work.
l think you took the right
initiative, Gabrielle.
lt shows you to be very wise.
Oh, really? Gabrielle....
Could you hold on just
one minute, please?
-Who is it, Nathan?
-l am on a work call... and l--
Nathan, l--
lt`s hormonal.
l can`t help it.
-Your entire body?
-I`m doing electrolysis.
It takes time. It`s working, but
in the meantime I have to shave-
-You have to shave? Like an ape?
-Apes don`t shave...
-you son of a bitch!
-Don`t quibble...
-you know what I mean.
-Please don`t be mad at me.
-I`m not mad, I`m disgusted.
-I`m the same person.
I have to think.
I have to go.
Hello? Is anybody there?
No, thank you.
I couldn`t eat another bite.
It is lovely to make
your acquaintance.
My apologies, madam.
It shan`t happen again.
-My compliments to the chef.
-``idiopathic hirsutism occurs...
in women who have hair follicles
highly sensitive to...
normal female androgen levels.``
How could I find myself
in this mess?
ls my girlfriend a man?
No. But she deceived me.
She has hair,
she`s not supposed to.
Oh, doctor! I did not know.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
l just came for
some papers I left.
Sorry I startled you,
l just came to think.
-My God, did I hang up on you?
-Oui.
Perhaps I called at a bad time?
-l am sorry.
-I'm sorry. I was distracted.
-ls everything fine?
-Oui.
Now you`ve got me talking French.
l was in my p.j.`s when l
remembered I left some papers...
l need to go over. See?
l rushed right out of the house.
-l must look a mess.
-No, not at all.
I'm in my p.j.`s, too.
Funny, huh?
And how is our son?
-What?
-Our son.
Puff.
He seems fine. I guess
we woke him up with the lights.
l should turn them off.
Maybe I sing him a lullaby
my mama sang to me...
when I was a little girl.
-When you`re a little French girl?
-But of course, silly.
That might be very soothing...
for him to hear that.
Can you point me to
the Cezanne exhibit?
There.
Shall we close up, then?
l shouldn`t say this, but...
-you`re a pretty girl, Gabrielle.
-Really?
-l always think of myself so ugly.
-No.
Well, no, not ugly, but plain.
A wallflower.
Not at all. You`re a very pretty
girl. You should know that.
-You should be confident.
-Thank you so much. Merci.
lt is too wonderful to hear a
man say such a nice compliment.
-lt`s true. I wouldn`t lie.
-You are sweet to me.
So soft.
-Doctor....
-I'm sorry.
l saw it, gentlemen. I saw the
whole sweaty, passionate...
ugly, beautiful act.
And to use the vernacular...
l wanted me some of that.
And I think I understood
from that moment...
that in order to get some,
l would have to play their game.
Excellent, Puff, excellent.
Excellent.
Now, the lady you`re with excuses
herself to go powder her nose.
-Perfect, Puff, perfect.
-Bravo.
l still feel guilt, even dead.
One would have hoped that....
You know, I really did love Lila.
lt`s just that with her problem
and then when Gabrielle...
revealed her feelings, l... She
was just so conventionally female.
She had that accent.
l... I was lost from then on.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan
I'm sorry to ask
but I need to know.
-Of course not.
-lt would be helpful to know.
No.
Because, you know, lately,
you seem so distant.
You work late every night and we
hardly ever have sex...
and when we do, it`s...
-different.
-I've been preoccupied lately.
Do you like my new look?
-lt`s nice.
-Really?
I'm trying, you know.
I'm trying to be what you want.
l want to be what
you want me to be, Nathan.
All I want is to be
what you want.
-You`re exactly what I want.
-Really?
Sure.
Of course.
I'm really trying.
You know what?
Louise said that I only have
two more years of electrolysis.
-That`s great.
-And I signed up for ballet class.
Look at my nails.
Like a real girl!
-That`s a great color on you.
-Oh, Nathan, let`s have a baby.
So that`s the nightmare I've been ha
for the life of me,
figure out what it`s about.
-l think it may be about Lila.
-Lila? How?
Ever since she broached the
subject of children you`ve been...
on edge, and I know you have
an issue with her body hair.
l see that.
That`s something to consider.
l felt it had more to do with
child-rearing concerns.
The monkey-baby representing
parenta...
l think it`s important that you
look at your feelings for Lila.
Well, I love Lila.
She`s wonderful. And she loves
me. That`s no small potatoes.
And she`s a good person.
That`s pretty rare in this world.
How could I stop loving someone...
because of a little
physical imperfection?
-lf it can even be called that.
-How do you feel about Gabrielle?
Good evening...
ladies...
and gentle...
men!
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Bravo, Puff, bravo!
lsn`t Puff doing spectacularly?
Nathan, we have to talk,
you and l.
-My little French poodle.
-Stop, get away.
-What is it?
-You have to choose.
lt is like Sophie`s Choice.
Only it is Nathan`s Choice.
Did you ever see that movie,
Sophie`s Choice? lt is like that.
Only it is this.
-I'm trying to sort things out.
-lt is now that you must decide!
l love you, Dr. Nathan.
But I will not wait.
l will not be your chippy...
your little Mademoiselle
Parlez-vous side dish.
l want to have...
a sweet, tiny baby...
inside my belly... from you.
l love you so much, Gabrielle.
But? But?
There is a ``but,`` Nathan.
l don`t know how to leave Lila.
Goodbye, Nathan.
