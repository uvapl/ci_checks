This is my village, my home.
The people who live here are simple,
and honest,
and I have often shared their
joys and their sorrows.
Today is a feast day, ...
commemorating a wonderful thing
that happened in a monastery nearby
many years ago.
The whole countryside will be there
for the celebration...
all except those too ill to go.
All except one of the priests
from the monastery...
Good morning, Padre!
- Good morning!
Morning, Father!
- Good Morning, Father!
Ahh, good morning!
Hello, Father!
- Good morning!
We are all going up to visit you!
I will be there later on.
There is no one left in the village.
Give him your blessing, Father.
He's only two weeks old!
(knocking)
Ah, good morning, Father.
- God be with you.
How is she?
- Worse.
It's Father Luis!
It was good of you to come, Father,
with the fiesta and all.
My fiesta is here.
I would like to see her.
- Why, of course Father, come right in.
You seem to be a lot better today.
- Everyone has gone away.
Yes, because it is the fiesta of...
wait a minute,
maybe you would like
to tell me whose fiesta it is.
Saint Marcelino.
- No, don't run away, Nicolas.
And do you know the story of Marcelino?
Your father knows it.
I'm afraid I've forgotten it.
You see, Father, we were just leaving
for the celebration.
I see.
I came especially to tell you about him.
Yes, but Father, wouldn't it keep...
until tomorrow?
If you wish it so.
Is it a pretty story?
Yes. A story for a little girl.
...and also for her parents.
But after all, perhaps you know it already.
You were born in this village.
Your father must have told you.
And my father told me, but I've forgotten.
Would you like to hear it?
- Uh huh!
Hmm...well, once upon a time,
this village where you were born...
this home that you are living in...
Did you know it was once in the
possession of the French army?
And the old monastery...
where everybody has gone
to celebrate the fiesta,
that was then,
the country house of the Duke.
At that time, the French were retreating
before the armies of Spain.
In their flight, they burned the houses
and crops of our people.
The fortified the big house on the hill
and decided to make a stand off.
(guns firing and people yelling)
Our people drove them out,
but at what a price!
The countryside lay ruined,
but we were free!
With time, crops grew again.
The trees were cured of their wounds
and villages rose anew.
Everything began to take life again
There remained only one ruin.
That great estate of the old nobility,
lost and alone in the countryside.
And why was that the only place left,
bearing the scares of war,
when all else was being rebuilt?
Perhaps because it had passed under the
control of the town council
and they were not sure what to do with it.
One day, three Franciscan Friars stood
before the mayor to ask a peculiar favor.
Of course we're only three now, but with
your permission to erect a monastery
our number will increase
with the help of God.
Don't you agree, Sir, that our work may be
of service to your people here?
It will not be easy,
do you have any resources?
The help of Our Father, ...
and our own labors.
You have my permission.
I am sure you will be of use here.
You will have to call a meeting of the
council to do this!
These are my orders.
In those ruins, my father perished,
defending his home against the invaders.
He's my assistant, Father.
He's a blacksmith, a good man
for taking care of horses.
He will accompany you to my house.
There, they will give you whatever tools you
may have need of, ...and something to eat.
Perhaps next week, I will visit you up there
to see that everything is alright.
May God repay you.
Now that Spain is once more ruled
by Spaniards,
we must make sure that those who come to
help are given whatever they need.
Go along!
(laughing)
Try again.
(Grunts)
(men laughing)
Why do you laugh at us?
(laughing continues)
Why do you come here? Huh?
To help.
Look! They're getting ahead of us!
What is wrong?
- They're going faster than we are!
Come on! Let's go!
Well done, Father.
The work was hard,
but everybody helped.
Everybody, huh? Ha ha...
Yes, my son, everybody.
(bell ringing)
And so, the years passed.
Years of peace,
which saw the company of monks
increase from three...to twelve.
The work and the love that all contributed
made the monastery seem, after a time
not only strong, but beautiful.
One morning, an ordinary morning
like all others...
The gatekeeper received a great surprise.
(baby crying)
Good morning...
little boy!
(bell ringing)
Come quick, Fathers!
I found a little boy out here!
A newborn baby boy!
A very handsome little boy!
(baby crying)
I found him when I opened the gate.
(baby crying)
He started crying when I picked him up.
What's all this? (baby crying)
Oh...let us bless the Lord!
Who could've given him to us?
I wonder why he began to cry when you
picked him up from the ground.
What happened?
I don't know.
What are we going to do with this child?
- We'll keep him, of course!
You mustn't touch him, brother!
He seems hungry.
What can we give him to eat?
I'll get some water for him!
(baby continues to cry)
May we keep him with us, Father?
Here is the water.
(baby crying)
Hmm...Ahh, ha ha ha
How hungry he is!
(baby stops crying)
Brothers, Brothers, we must not lose our
wits over this poor creature.
There is nothing, or almost nothing that
we can do for him.
One thing we are able to do, with the
permission of Your Reverence of course, ...
There's no reason why we can't make a
Christian out of him at least.
(laughing)
Come Brothers.
What name shall we give him, Father?
Perhaps it would be alright if we named
him after today's saint.
Very well.
It's Saint Marcelino.
Who'll be Godfather?
Brother Francisco?
Marcelino, I baptize you in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Listen to me, Brothers. The sun is already
very high and we have work to do.
I think it would be wise for those of you
who are visiting the neighborhood,
to inquire about this child discretely.
First of all, find out if some newborn child
is missing from his home.
Or if there's any talk of a missing child
in any of the villages.
Second,... perhaps you will hear of a young
mother in disgrace.
A poor woman who even now,
regrets giving up her child.
Tell me when you return.
(baby crying)
(bell ringing softly)
Brother, where are the spoons?
- Did you try the pantry?
I can't find the spoons!
They might be in the kitchen. -A ha.
Did you find those spoons yet, Brother?
- No! I don't know where he keeps them!
Hasn't Brother Thomas prepared
breakfast yet?
He's sleeping.
- He was up all night.
Very well, ...
We'll do it ourselves then.
Is everything ready?
- No spoons.
(loud clang)
I found the spoons!
(baby crying)
I didn't mean to do it, Father.
He just can't stop crying.
He must be sick.
What makes you say something so foolish?
- Because he's crying.
A baby cries because something hurts him.
If something hurts, it's because he's sick.
When he's sick, he cries.
He's crying and so...
he must be sick!
Brothers!
Good afternoon, Brother.
My wife said to me, "Look, since you're
going past the monastery,
give this to the Brothers
for their little baby."
Thank you! Thank you.
For the little one.
God bless you!
You and your wife!
Adios, Brother.
Adios.
You be careful with him, Brother!
- I'm the one who found him, no?
He smiles... at last!
Ah, yes, he smiles...
but if I stop for a minute, he yells!
(laughing)
I think, Father, that even though we do our
best to investigate this matter
according to your instructions,
we're not going to find out anything.
The only thing I've been able to find out
is that no babies are missing
from the villages I visited.
You have news?
Yes, Father.
Will you leave us please, Brothers.
Cheer up, Brothers! He's still with us.
No one has taken him away yet.
Brothers, ...
The parents of Marcelino do not exist.
They are probably in Heaven.
I'm so glad! - Because they are in Heaven.
(nervous laugh)
That's what I mean.
It's almost six weeks since the child
first came to live with us.
(laughs of acknowledgement)
Now, Brothers, ...
Our work is different from bringing
up young children.
Twelve monks taking care of one infant...
We have other obligations.
We won't neglect them, Father.
- He's our recreation!
But we cannot do much for the child if
we allow him to remain with us here.
He needs a mother.
(baby crying)
We should try to find a family.
A family that will bring him up,
right, like any other boy.
A good family, one which preferably
already has children.
(baby crying)
Good morning, Father.
God be with you.
I do not come to ask alms today,
I come to give you something.
Go on, Father.
I'm sure you've heard that we're taking
care of a little child up at the monastery.
We've looked for his parents,
but they're dead.
You are an honorable man, Juan.
You have a good wife and you may well
be proud of your children.
I know it, Father.
I know it.
With you, our child
would have a family.
And you will please the Lord
with this great act of charity.
The land is poor...
and there are so many mouths.
May God bless this house.
- Good Morning, Brother!
Good Morning! You will share our
meal with us, Brother.
No, thank you.
I only came to ask you a question.
Go ahead, Brother.
How would you like to have a little baby?
Oh, no, you don't understand.
You won't have to do anything.
He's already born.
Yes. It's the one we have with us
at the monastery.
What a bawler!
The greatest bawler in the world!
None of us have had a moment's rest
since we found him.
And what an appetite! We've almost had to
give up eating ourselves!
But the worst is how he cries,
he never stops! He's always crying.
Of course, when he eats
he doesn't cry very loud.
God will give you more help.
(laughing)
I can help myself, Brother.
Do you blaspheme?
Don't waste my time with your sermons.
Give me the child and be off with you!
AH! Clumsy fool!
Won't I have enough trouble with
another mouth to feed!
Ahhh...you lost your tongue?
What are you waiting for?
Go bring me the child!
I cannot do that.
Hey, Brother of the Devil!
What's the matter with you?!
I'm not a brother of the devil.
I'm a monk of God.
And you are an unjust man.
I cannot give you the child.
Oh, I see.
And with you, Brother?
Well, Father, I - I failed, too.
I went up to the mountain
to ask the shepherd.
And he wasn't around
so I shouted for him.
And his answer was "no".
It was very clear.
He won't be able...
to take care of the child.
And is this the same shepherd who lives
all alone up on the mountain?
And is 80 years old?
Yes, yes! That's the very one, Father.
Oh, I see.
We've not had much luck up until now.
But we must keep trying.
If none of my brothers can find
Marcelino a home,... I will.
(Latin prayer)
Come in, Father.
For you, I am always well
and in good humor.
Don Emilio.
Oh, are you working?
I'm glad that you have come, Father.
Sit down.
I am just finishing up a document
...that you will find of interest.
Before I pass away,
...I would like to formalize you situation.
I've decided that the municipality will
bestow upon your order and perpetuity,
the land which you now possess.
Don Emilio, this would only serve to
make us abandon your house.
The rules of our order are very strict.
We can live only by charity.
I merely wanted to arrange
everything legally.
You must not feel that we're ungrateful,
Don Emilio.
And we shall never forget you
in our prayers.
I may have need of them before long.
Well, what news do you bring me today?
Rosa!
Go ahead, Father, tell me, tell me!
Well this business of Marcelino...
- Take this away!
We must find a family for him.
- Huh?... What a pity.
I'm not much help there.
I won't be here much longer.
But anyway, let me think about it.
Rosa!
Listen Rosa, ...
How many children has Vargas got...
the one at the Mill?
Six, I think.
- Ah...
(Goats naying, water running)
Good day, Father!
Can I do anything for you?!
No, no, nothing, thank you.
Thank you, goodbye.
You speak to him, Brother.
Me?!
Excuse me, Father.
Did you find anyone?
Not quite.
It's a very fine family alright.
Six children, they have.
All healthy.
However,...
The place itself is unsatisfactory.
The water there might be dangerous.
Marcelino will stay here.
Each monk will be his mother and his father.
We will look no further.
We will keep him here.
As long as the Father Provincial
does not decide otherwise.
He will become a monk.
- Like us!
I will teach him music!
- I will show him to grow flowers.
And I, how to read.
- I'll teach him to cook!
Brothers, Brothers.
And to pray? Who?
I will, if you like.
(baby crying)
May we go, Father?
Are you ill, Father?
- No, just drowsy.
I heard everything, my son,
and I am content.
May we enter the church, Father?
I want to go to confession.
Brothers!
Brothers, come quick!
What! What is it?!
Don Emilio is dying, he wants a priest!
- I will go!
I will have to notify Father Superior, first.
- Very well.
(Bell ringing)
Some die.
And others are born.
But of those who die,
it is always known if they were good men.
While of those to come,
what can we know?
(laughing)
I'm happy to know that our new mayor
is a upright man.
You're right,
you can all rest easy now.
I promise to protect your rights the same
way as I protect those of your new mayor.
Very Good! Here! Here!
Alfonzo, bring some wine.
We want to celebrate!
(laughing)
Good day.
Prepare my new suit.
I'm paying a visit to someone.
Good day.
I've come to hear you explain why you
allowed one of your men to insult me.
And to get the child.
But why?
One of your monks asked me to take the
child into my house.
And then he refused to let me have him!
I am as honorable as any man.
And nobody refuses me anything.
And besides,...
now that I'm your mayor.
I would like to know if you...
- You would like to know if we... what?
If you would all have the courage
to refuse me again.
You have said it.
You refuse me once more?!
Yes.
But why?! What am I a thief?
A murderer? A man of evil ways?
No, you are none of those.
But you are one who is unjust.
I want that child!
Tell the truth.
You wish merely to satisfy your greed.
You don't want the child.
You don't care a thing about him.
You don't like children.
You want only to know...
that you can have what you wish.
You may not have the child.
Very well.
You may keep the child with you.
But here...here, no!
Listen to me, ...
do whatever you like with that child.
Because neither you, nor he
will stay here any longer.
I promise you that!
Here we are.
When Don Emilio gave that land away,
he went beyond his powers.
I will not allow this.
The bottom line.
But, Don Emilio needed no signatures
to perform a good deed.
You, to perform an evil one,
expect us to sign this?
I will not do it.
Speak no further of this matter.
What change is there in a large tree
in five years?
In that length of time, how much
can a thick stone wall change?
Not at all, true?
But what change in a newborn child
when we see him five years later!
At five, Marcelino was a robust
and lively child.
He had given a name to each
of the Brothers.
And now they were no longer called,
not even among themselves,
Brother Thomas, Brother Jose, Brother
Francisco...but by the child's names:
Brother Sickly, Brother Gatekeeper, Brother
Cookie, Brother Bellringer, as suited each.
Many times there was joy in the monastery,
and other times worry.
For although he was really as good as bread,
sometimes his actions were not.
And his pranks in the kitchen, in the dining
room, in the garden, or the chapel,
made the Brothers shake their heads,
but all forgave him his little mischief.
How did he live? What did the child,
Marcelino, do among those twelve monks?
You will see...
For I am going to tell of a day in his life.
It is like a song...
Wake now, wake now, Marcelino.
Day is breaking, Bright and new.
Twelve monks guard him, Sleeping and
waking, Singing for him this lullaby.
Marcelino, now you are waking,
Birds and sunlight call to you.
Twelve monks guard him, Sleeping and
waking, Singing for him this lullaby.
Marcelino, please use the soap now,
Don't forget behind the ears.
Eat a hearty breakfast.
Finish up your porridge.
Grow like Brother Cookie,
Grow up big and strong.
Pull the rope now, Pull it harder,
You and Brother Bellringer ring the bell!
Ding, - Dong,
Ding, - Dong.
Two and two are?
- Four
Four and four are?
- Eight
Eight and eight are?
Twenty!
- A terrible mistake!
Learn to pray now, Marcelino.
All good children know their prayers.
Our Father...
- Our Father
Who art in Heaven
- Who art in Heaven
Hallowed be...
- Hallowed be
With the sun the child awakens,
With the sun he goes to sleep.
Twelve monks guard him, Sleeping and
waking, Singing for him this lullaby.
While in Heaven, Mother is watching,
Praying God, him safe to keep.
Go to sleep now, Marcelino.
Marcelino, go to sleep.
Do you need some help?!
- Yes, Brother, this cart is very old.
Is it broken?
Yes, but we will fix it very soon.
(baby crying)
Hello!
Do you live here?
Oh yes! I came here when I was very young.
I was one week old.
And...after that...
- Yes?
And after that came Brother Bellringer
and Brother Cookie and all the rest.
Don't you have any parents?
- Yes, I have twelve.
Is that so? And your mothers?
Mothers I don't have even one.
Are you a mother? Huh?
Yes, I have two children.
My biggest is a boy like you.
Manuel?! Manuel?! Manuel?!
Marcelino!!
- Just a minute!
That's Brother Cookie, I have to go now.
You're a pretty mother.
Manuel?!
Where have you been?
Didn't you hear the whistle?
(whistle blowing)
What happened?
Come on, sit down.
Today you're going to learn about
a letter that's very simple.
The most simple of all.
You're going to like to make this one.
It's name is "O".
It's round like the wheel of a cart.
You see.
I saw a mother today!
Where?
- Outside there.
Did you like her?
- Of course!
(Manuel!)
(- I'm coming, Mother!)
Who is that?
- Manuel.
And who is Manuel?
- Her son.
What is he like?
- Like me...that's what she said.
Then you haven't seen him.
- No.
Why is the moon thin,
and then it gets fat?
Because...uh, well, because, uh,
the moon is always the same, Marcelino.
It just seems to change because...hmm
wait a minute...
The moon reflects the light from...
(laugh)
You're very young and you can't expect
to understand it very well.
But I will try to explain...
The part that we see is what the sun
lights up for us. Hmm?
Whew
Did all of us have mothers?
Certainly we did. You, ...me.
- And even Father Superior?
Even Father Superior.
All of us, Marcelino, all of us.
Then where is mine?
She's in Heaven.
And was she pretty?
- Of course, she was very pretty.
Manuel.
Manuel?!
Manuel... Manuel!
You just watch, you'll see.
I buried it right here.
See...here are my treasures, Manuel.
Brother Sickly gave me this
from his medicines.
And Brother Cookie gave me this.
It really works, see?
And this is a very good horn!
And look what the Captain gave me!
This is my favorite treasure!
(Here's a blue glass for looking at the sun,
see!)
(Lots and lots of bones!
And they're all good ones!)
Who's Marcelino talking to?
- Manuel.
Who's Manuel?
- Ha, I wish I knew!
Come on now, we'll take it all over there.
Both of us together, we'll build it.
Who do you keep talking to, Marcelino?
To Manuel.
- Ah, Manuel. A friend of yours, eh?
Yes.
And he talks with you, I guess, eh?
- Of course he does.
Tell me, does he play ball with you, too?
No, but we do lots of other things together.
(bell thudding)
(laughing)
(Goats naying, bells clanging)
You've been a very very bad little boy.
And all the Brothers are angry.
So am I.
And from now on you must obey me
especially in one thing.
You must never climb the stairway.
You must never climb this stairway.
Never! ...Never!
Do you hear? Never!
Marcelino!
How many times must I tell you
to keep away from those stairs?!
There's a very big man up there
and if he ever sees you,
if he ever catches you,
he will take you away forever!
Now go play somewhere else.
It is not right to awaken
fear in children, Brother.
It seems to me it would be good for
him to be afraid of something.
You have to pack them very hard,
so you can shoot straight with 'em.
Watch out now! Get ready!
Hold the gun, Manuel.
The enemy's coming!
Aim straight now, ready!
And fire! (Dog barking)
Come on, Manuel!
Again! Fire at will! Ha ha!
He's running away! He's afraid!
Hit him again!
Where's Marcelino?
- He's out there.
What's he doing out there
when he should be in here?
What's the difference? He's alright.
- Maybe.
And besides he was told.
He has no reason to be outside.
He should be in here with us.
Do you want him to be with us always?
- I think he ought to be in here,
because something might happen to him out
there that could never happen to him
if he was inside here.
You think Marcelino is some kind of
flower?
He's a boy, the same as any other boy.
He has to run. He has to play.
- What if something happens to him?!
Oh, why worry about that.
Besides, he's almost six.
He will have to learn about the world.
Why don't you take him to town
with you sometime?
They will be having the fair at
Alda Major next week.
Might be a good idea.
- It would tire him out.
Yes, it would tire him out.
(laughing)
(small bell ringing)
Come on, Manuel.
(small bell ringing)
Be careful, Manuel.
(whistle)
Marcelino, get the water for me, son.
Does it hurt very bad, Brother Sickly?
- A little, yes.
If I give you a kiss where it hurts,
will it feel better?
Certainly, Marcelino, it will help.
Come on. Give me a kiss.
It really works. Nothing hurts me now.
Nothing?!
- Nothing, child, nothing.
Now, run along and play.
- Adios!
Hey!
Why you little brat!
What are you trying to do?!
Is that the way they educate you up there?!
Drop that!
We'll see about this, right now!
The way you're bringing him up.
You see how that boy behaves!
We're very sorry, Señor.
These are only childish pranks.
You think so?
I say they're the pranks of those who
permit a child to become a savage.
What do you teach him, anyway?
What are the twelve of you doing
with that little devil?!
Will you please try to talk more quietly.
We are not deaf.
Yes. I'm wasting my time.
It's useless to talk to creatures
who are only half men.
You'd hide behind those habits anyway!
Where's your superior?
Got him out here! Show him how that little
devil of yours treats the mayor of his town!
(Screaming and crying)
Oh no!
He was outside when he should
have been inside!
(groaning)
He has fever.
Sponge him with some cold water.
Let him sleep if he can.
(whimpering)
(mouse squeaking)
You must never climb those stairs.
There is a very big man up there.
You must never climb the stairway.
There is a man who will
take you away forever.
Take you away forever...
Take you away forever.
What's the matter, Marcelino?
Sleep my boy, sleep now.
Is the fever any better?
- He's perspiring.
Will you stay with him a while, Father?
I would like to get some fresh water.
Of course, go on, go on, Brother.
Are all mothers in Heaven?
Yes. Well, ...
That is where all mothers go.
Then it was really true what Brother Cookie
told me about you?
Certainly, what did he say?
- That even you have a mother.
Yes, but my mother's in Heaven now.
But how did she get there?
By being very good.
And am I good?
- Oh yes, you're very good.
Then when will I go there?
That depends, Marcelino,
whenever God wants you to.
He's much better now.
Brother Cookie, will you tell me something?
- What?
How do you go to Heaven?
Oh! Marcelino, be good now.
There, doesn't that feel good?
Sleep now. Sleep now little one.
Go to sleep.
Now don't let them hear us, Manuel.
Up here they won't see us.
(Gasp)
Did you see it, Manuel?!
It was just like Brother Cookie
said it was!
Well, well, little man.
We've never seen you here at the fair.
I'm Marcelino.
(man laughs)
This is the first time he's come with me.
- Well, goodbye little man, have fun!
Look there!
That's Marcelino.
Hey Brother, are you putting him
up for sale? (laughing)
Listen Marcelino, ...
I must go in here for a minute.
There's a sick man who
wants to be confessed.
You wait for me right here, understand?
I'll be out soon.
Who are you?
- Marcelino.
Wanna help me? - Alright.
Come on, push!
Oh my!
Oh my beautiful apples!
Don't move you little thief!
What are you doing? Come here!
Come here, you thief!
Help me, somebody!
Catch him! Don't let him go!
(screaming)
Marcelino!...
Marcelino!
(screaming)
Oh, ...Come along!
I wonder if now, you will still refuse
to give me your signatures as...
you have in the past.
Have you thought of the damage
done to our reputations?!
Our fair was once famous throughout the
district now we're a laughing stock.
By now, the whole countryside must think
we have no law and order here.
But if the monks pay for the damages?
- Ah,...
What makes you think they'll be
able to pay for them?
The damages I can take care of, if necessary.
But what about the injured?
That woman,...she claims the boy's a thief!
Let us think about it for a while.
Very well then.
I'll be back here this afternoon
around six.
Esteban!
Listen uh, it's possible that I might need
those 400 ryalis you borrowed from me.
Well, I, ...right away?
I see, you can't pay up.
But you can oppose me in Council Meeting.
That you can do, huh?
The Coward signed it alright.
Now we'll see.
I've been very kind about it, too.
I gave them a whole month
to abandon the monastery.
Well, you don't like what I'm doing?
Nevermind!
You never like what I do anyhow.
But you like eating my bread, don't you?!
Well, orders are orders, Father, but
sometimes...well, believe me,
I have no stomach for this business.
Don't worry, Captain,
when the thirty days are up,
no one will have to come to tell us to go
away. We'll already be gone.
But on the appointed day, not before.
If we could only do something about it.
We can expect no help from anyone
except Him who has power
to change the heart of man.
And to bring peace into his soul.
Don't worry about the boy,
I've already talked to my wife about it.
He'll live with us.
And I can guarantee you, Father,
he'll make a fine Civil Guardsman.
You're very kind, but we still have some
time. Everything will work out.
Can I help you?
- No.
Now if it moves or anything,
we'll run away. Alright?
Be careful, Manuel.
We'd better get a stick.
Now, you watch if anybody's coming.
He doesn't move at all.
You look very hungry.
I'll bring you something to eat!
Brother Cookie, help me quick!
There's a scorpion out here!
Marcelino! Marcelino!
I got some bread.
I couldn't find anything else,
I was in such a big hurry.
I'd better go now, because
I fooled Brother Cookie.
But I'll see you again tomorrow.
He was hungry, Manuel.
Father, why must we work so hard,
when our labors will bear us no fruits?
Us, no.
But for someone perhaps they will.
Only our Lord may interrupt our task here...
Only our Lord.
Marcelino?...
Marcelino?
Today I have bread and wine for you.
The wine doesn't taste very good,
but it helps you feel warm, the Brothers say.
Wouldn't you rather come down and
maybe eat your bread right here with me?
Are you not afraid, little one?
No.
- And do you then know who I am?
Yes, you are God.
I give you my thanks.
You are a good child.
But all the Brothers say that I'm bad.
And what does Manuel say?
- You mean you know Manuel?!
He likes you, doesn't he?
- Yes.
We... speak about you.
From this day on, you shall be known as
Marcelino Pan y Vino.
Marcelino Pan y Vino.
That's a pretty name.
Did it...did it hurt?
Yes, very much.

Little flowers of St Francis of Assisi,
Chapter Eight
How St Francis explained to
Brother Leo what things are perfect joy.
One day in winter, as St. Francis was going
with Brother Leo from Perugia
to St Mary of the Angels, and was suffering
greatly from the cold. (bell ringing)
One day in winter, as St. Francis was going
with Brother Leo from Perugia
to St Mary of the Angels, and was suffering
greatly from the cold.
He called to Brother Leo, who was walking
on before him, and said to him,
"Brother Leo, if it were to please God, that
the Friars Minor should give in all lands
a great example of holiness and edification,
write down and note carefully
that this would not be perfect joy."
A little farther on, St Francis called him a
second time.
"Oh Brother Leo, if the Friars Minor were
to make the lamb to walk,
if they should make straight the crooked,
chase away demons, give sight to the blind,
hearing to the deaf, speech to the dumb, and
what is even a far greater work,
if they should raise the dead after four days,
write that this would not be perfect joy."
My name is Marcelino Pan y Vino.
Shhh! Little one.
- Keep still, Marcelino.
Shortly after, he cried out again.
"Oh Brother Leo, if the Friars Minor knew
all languages,
if they were versed in all science, if they
could explain all scripture,
if they had the gift of prophesy..."
Don't get frightened, Manuel.
I came up in case you were frightened.
And you, Marcelino, are you afraid?
Yes.
- Come closer.
Now the thunder is coming.
It doesn't matter now.
Marcelino.
What are you doing with that blanket?
- I'm cold.
But don't you already have one,
like everyone else?
Yes, but I'm still cold.
Your broth, Father.
I warmed it up for you.
Hmm...much better now.
Marcelino.... Marcelino!
Marcelino! ... Marcelino.
What did you do with the blanket?
Come on, Come on, the blanket!
What did you do with it?
I don't know.
Now look,... Marcelino.
Brother Cookie loves you,
but you know if you ever get him really
angry it will be a terrible thing.
We've been good friends up to now,
but if you want to be difficult, very well.
Now, I want to find that blanket
on your bed tonight.
If it is not there, I will have to speak
to Father Superior.
Hello.
You can have the blanket, Marcelino.
I am no longer cold.
Oh, I'll take it back then!
Here's the blanket.
I'm not cold now.
Marcelino! Marcelino!
Ah, Marcelino, look!
I found a beautiful frog for you, see!
I don't want it now.
- What?!
I tried.
Then the robbers went away in anger,
much troubled by these words.
Shortly after, St Francis arrived at the
convent with a sack of bread
and a little vessel of wine, which he and his
companion had begged.
And the guardian related to him how he had
sent away the robbers.
On this St Francis reproved him sharply,
saying that he had behaved most cruelly.
For sinners are brought back to God more
easily by kindness than by harsh words.
"Wherefore," said he, "Our Master Jesus
Christ, whose word we have promised to
observe, says that the whole need not a
physician, but they that are sick.
And that he came not to call the just, but
sinners to repentance.
For which reason he oft sat down to meet
with them.
Hmm...he's always alone.
We'll have to find him a friend.
What? A friend? I already have a friend.
Yes, a very good friend, too.
Manuel is a boy...
like Marcelino, but he's
...well...you know. (laugh)
You spend more time with Marcelino than
anyone else.
And no one could understand as well as you
do, the cause of his recent behavior.
Every one of us is worried about Marcelino.
Each of us is responsible for this boy.
But he's an angel, Father.
- Yes,
yes, but this change in him is very
important.
Perhaps the time has come to separate him
from us.
To separate him from us!?
- Yes, Brother.
Marcelino may be ill without our being
aware of it.
He's in perfect health, Father, I'm sure of it!
No, Brother, I mean sick from solitude, from
loneliness...
from a lack of children of his own age.
Come now, you know more about him than
any of us.
If you do not help us, Brother, we cannot do
anything.
Well, Father, for a long time now...
- Sit down, Brother Thomas, sit down.
I'm sorry, Father. For quite a while now, I -
I've been missing things from the kitchen.
Some bread, potatoes, some wine.
The wine seems to be drying up
before my eyes.
The wine?
- Yes, Father. The fruit wine.
Several bottles have been emptied.
And it is the child, no doubt about it.
But this is very dangerous, Brother Thomas!
I can't imagine what he does with these
things. He eats well enough at meals.
Anyway, a few days ago, I put all of them
out of his reach.
That was wrong.
I should have told you first, Father.
Pardon me.
No, no, you did what you thought was right.
But I'm afraid it was not wise to put the
things where the boy could not reach them.
Put them all back. Let him get whatever he
wants from the kitchen. And then...
and then...
follow him to find out what he does with it.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, and Marcelino.
(Where did you get the blanket, Marcelino?)
(- I found it in the cellar.)
(And you were a very good boy
to bring it to me.)
(I hope it keeps you warm.)
(- Sure it will.)
(You've been very kind,
bringing me bread and wine.)
(I wanted to make sure you're not hungry.)
(- That's why I christened you.)
(It's a nice name.)
You are very quiet, Marcelino.
What are you thinking?
I wonder where your mother is now.
She is with yours.
What are they like?
What do they do? Mothers...
They give, Marcelino.
They always give.
And what do they give?
They give themselves. They give their lives
and the light of their eyes to their children.
Until they are old and wrinkled.
Are they very ugly?
Not ugly, Marcelino.
Mothers are never ugly.
(bell ringing)
I must go now, they want me.
Do you love your mother very much?
With all my heart.
- I love mine more!
You must not allow a little child to play
such tricks on you, Brother.
You should try to find out what he does with
the food. And be very careful this time.
Should I speak to him?
- No, not at all.
Find out what happens for me,
and I'll do the rest. - Ah.
Come, Marcelino. You have been a good
boy, and I wish to give you a reward.
That which you most desire.
Tell me...do you wish to be a monk, like
Brother Bernardo, Brother Cookie
or Father Superior?
Or would you prefer to have Manuel
come to you?
I would rather see my mother.
Besides I want to see your mother, too.
And do you wish to see them now?
- Yes, now.
Then you will have to go to sleep.
- But I'm not sleepy now.
Come, you can fall asleep in my arms.
- Alright.
Sleep now, Marcelino.
Brothers! ... Come up!
Come up quickly! Marcelino!
The child,... my Lord, ...my God!
And the entire town, the whole fair,
went up to the monastery
on learning of the miracle.
Since then, each year,
with its mayor at the head,
the town goes up to celebrate the miracle
of Marcelino Pan y Vino.
I come to speak to them of you, my Lord.
And of you, Marcelino.
