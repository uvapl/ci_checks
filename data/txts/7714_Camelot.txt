This is what I get in return for 30 years
of service for my company?
And they send some yo-yo like you
in here,
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?
They should be telling you
you're out of a job.
You have a lot of gall, coming in here
and firing your No.1 producer.
You're going to go home and make
more money than you've ever made in your life
and I'm going to go home
without a pay cheque. Fuck you.
I guess you leave me dumbfounded.
I don't know where this is coming from.
How am I meant to go back as a man
and explain to my wife I lost my job?
On a stress level, I've heard that
losing your job is like a death in the family.
But personally,
I feel more like
the people I worked with
were my family and I died.
I can't afford to be unemployed.
I have a house payment,
I have children.
I don't know how you can live
with yourself,
but I'm sure that you'll find a way
while the rest of us are suffering.
Who the fuck are you, man?
<i>Excellent question. Who the fuck am I?</i>
<i>Poor Steve has worked here
for seven years.</i>
<i>He's never had a meeting with me
before or passed me in the hall,</i>
<i>or told me a story in the break room.</i>
<i>That's because I don't work here.</i>
<i>I work for another company that lends
me out to pussies like Steve's boss</i>
<i>who don't have the balls
to sack their own employees,</i>
<i>in some cases for good reason.
People do crazy shit when they get fired.</i>
Did I do something wrong?
I mean, is there something
I could do differently here?
This is not an assessment of your
productivity. Don't take this personally.
Don't take it personally.
Steven, I want you to review this packet.
Take it seriously. I think you're gonna
find a lot of good answers in here.
I'm sure this is gonna be very helpful -
a packet.
Thank you... A packet.
Well, anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world sat where you are right now.
And it's because they sat there
they were able to do it.
That's the truth.
I'm gonna need your keycard.
Great. OK.
Now, I want you to take the day, go get
together your personal things, then tomorrow
you get yourself some exercise.
You go out for a jog,
you give yourself some routines
and pretty soon you find your legs.
How do I get in touch with you?
- Don't worry, we'll be in touch soon.
This is just the beginning.
<i>I'll never see Steve again.</i>
<i>To know me is to fly with me.
This is where I live.</i>
<i>When I run my card,</i>
<i>the system automatically prompts the desk clerk
to greet me with this exact statement:</i>
Pleasure to see you again,
Mr Bingham.
<i>It's these kinds of systemised friendly
touches that keep my world in orbit.</i>
<i>All the things you probably hate
about travelling -</i>
<i>the recycled air, the artificial lighting,
the digital juice dispensers,</i>
<i>the cheap sushi -
are warm reminders that I'm home.</i>
Do you want the cancer?
The what?
- Do you want the cancer?
The cancer?
The can...sir?
- Oh, no. I'm fine, thank you.
How much does your life weigh?
Imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders. Feel 'em?
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.
Start with the little things,
the things on shelves and in drawers
the knick-knacks, the collectibles.
Feel the weight as that adds up.
Then you start adding larger stuff -
clothes, table-top appliances, lamps, linens...
your TV...
The backpack should be getting
pretty heavy now. And you go bigger.
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table.
Stuff it all in there.
Your car, get it in there.
Your home, whether it's
a studio apartment or a two-bedroomed house.
I want you to stuff it all
into that backpack.
Now try to walk.
It's kind of hard, isn't it?
This is what we do to ourselves
on a daily basis
We weigh ourselves down until we can't
even move. And make no mistake...
moving is living.
Now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire.
What do you want to take out of it?
Photos?
Photos are for people who can't remember.
Drink some ginkgo and let the photos burn.
In fact, let everything burn
and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing.
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?
Welcome back, Mr Bingham.
Ryan Bingham's office.
- You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.
They were out of all full-size sedans.
- Did you try...
Yes, I reminded them of your remarkable
No.1 Gold Club status in years in the program.
They are literally moving mountains
to see you in a Sebring.
Fair enough. Any other messages?
- Er...your sister Kara called.
Needs to speak urgently
about your sister's wedding.
I told her you were mid-air,
and not even I knew your destination.
Well done. - You got an invitation
to speak at GoalQuest in Vegas.
GoalQuest 20?
<i>Every once in a while, I do speaking engagements,
motivational stuff. But GoalQuest?</i>
<i>We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.</i>
It's got a hologram on it.
They're calling it Dos Equis.
All right, I'll check in.
- I've got Craig Gregory for you.
Wait...ah.
Fuck.
How is my little road warrior?
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding
into a world of bliss.
Real good numbers out of Phoenix,
Ry guy.
You know that Big Auto is about to cut
another 10K by the end of the month?
No kidding.
- Christmas came early.
I wish you could be in five places, but
I need you here in Omaha this week. Alright?
I thought you needed me everywhere.
- We got something real big, a real game changer.
What are we talking about here?
You'll see. Today I took my first crap
in two weeks - hallelujah.
That's me hanging up on you.
- Great, love that sound.
Are you satisfied with Maestro?
Yeah, I am.
A little stingy with their miles.
I like Hertz.
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.
If a car has over 20,000 miles, I won't drive it.
Maestro doesn't instant checkout.
I like the park-and-go.
Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.
- You don't seem like a girl who needs directions.
I hate asking for directions.
- That's why I get a nav.
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.
Is that a joke?
- Yes.
Their kiosk placement blows.
- They never have available upgrades.
Basically, it's a fleet of shit boxes. I
don't know how they're still in business.
I'm Ryan.
- I'm Alex.
Aww...Maplewood card.
How dare you bring that into this palace?
Hilton offers equal value and better food but
the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check-in.
I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality.
There's an industry term for that.
It's a mixture of faux and homey - faumey.
Oh, my God.
I wasn't sure this actually existed.
This is the American Airlines...
- It's a Concierge Key, yeah.
What is that, carbon fibre?
- Graphite.
Oh, I love the weight. - I was pretty excited
the day that bad boy came in.
I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.
60 thou a year, domestic.
That's not bad.
- Don't patronise me.
What's your total?
- It's a personal question.
Pleace.
- And we hardly know each other.
Show some hubris.
Come on, impress me.
I bet it's huge.
- You have no idea.
How big?
What is it, this big? This big?
- I don't want to brag.
Oh, come on! Come on.
Let's just say I have a number in mind.
I haven't hit it yet.
This is pretty fucking sexy.
- Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.
We're two people who get turned on by Elite Status.
I think cheap is our starting point.
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.
We came up with this master plan,
which was for me...
...to put gauze,
to put bandages on both my hands.
Then we got on the plane,
transatlantic, flying to erm...Zurich.
I waited till it was dark,
and I walked up to the bathroom with her.
Everybody was watching the movie and I was like...
Opened up, went inside. She opened the door for me,
and came in like she was gonna help me.
We gave it our best shot. It wasn't
great. But it was fun. It was tricky.
Give me some details.
- It's not so easy. Have you tried it?
It's not so easy.
- Yes, I have.
Really?
- Really.
You've done that?
- I have done that.
On a transatlantic flight?
- On a domestic flight - regional, actually.
At night-time?
- Daytime.
What?
- How do you do that?
Oh, I'm really flexible.
Look. Ohh.
Ah, I should throw these out.
We can always use that room
with the ice machine.
Look.
Good call on that towel rack.
I like how you burritoed me
in the sofa cushions.
I was improvising.
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.
We got to do this again.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm in Newark on the 12th,
Modesto on the 13th...
Oklahoma City on the 15th...
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging by
Albuquerque week of the 16th.
No, I'm in Florida on the 20th.
- Fort Lauderdale?
Miami.
- That's nothing. - 40 minutes.
I should probably go back to my room
so I can wake up in my bed.
I think that would be
the ladylike thing to do.
Nice meeting you.
- A pleasure.
Hello?
<i>Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?</i>
<i>Every family has one person
who keeps the genealogy in check.</i>
<i>That's my sister Kara - the glue.</i>
Fine. You and the kids?
Missy's outstanding,
Matthew made varsity. How's the road?
Couldn't be better.
<i>Good. So, Ryan?</i>
Yeah?
I didn't even want to ask you this, because I know
how you are about doing things for others.
But we're coming up on three weeks to go to
Julie's wedding and we could really use your help.
Yeah?
<i>We've been sending people these kits,</i>
<i>so they can print out photos
of Julie and Jim on cardbord,</i>
and then take photos of them in interesting places,
like that gnome in the French movie.
Why?
Because it's Julie's wedding and she thinks
it would be fun. Does it matter why?
How is Julie?
<i>Would you call her.
She thinks you've turned to butter.</i>
You're awfully isolated how you live.
- Isolated? I'm surrounded.
<i>So your assistant said
you were gonna be in Vegas.</i>
Did he?
Can you get a photo of the cut-out
in front of the Luxor pyramid?
The place is a shithole.
Nobody stays there.
Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check in.
Can you just take a stupid photo?
I'll try my best.
<i>Thank you for trying your best.</i>
<i>Last year,
I spent 322 days on the road,</i>
<i>which means I had to spend
43 miserable days at home.</i>
Hey, neighbour.
I signed for this while you were gone.
- Oh, thanks.
I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.
- Nah.
It's my sister. I haven't met the guy yet.
They're getting married.
Lots of luck.
- I know, right?
What are you doing tonight?
You wanna come over later?
Um...I've started seeing somebody.
Oh. OK. Great.
Hey, it's good to see you.
You too.
- It seems like it's been a while this time.
I'm thrilled that everyone's back
under one roof. Welcome home, boy's.
There's been a lot of whispering about
why we're here, so let me jump right in.
Retailers are down 20%.
Auto industry is in the dump.
Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.
It is one of the worst times on record
for America.
This is our moment.
Now, last summer, we received
a dynamite young woman here from Cornell.
And she had some pretty big ideas
that she challenged me with.
My first reaction was,
"Who does this kid think she is?"
But after I gave it a listen,
she really knocked me out. So...
With a peek into our future,
Natalie Keener.
If there's one word I want to
leave you with today, it's this.
Glocal?
Glocal.
Our global must become local.
This company keeps 23 people
on the road at least 250 days a year.
It's expensive and it's inefficient
When I came to Craig
three months ago with this,
he told me, and quite astutely, it's only
a problem if you have a solution.
Well, today I stand before you
with just that.
You all know Ned in reception.
Today I'm gonna fire Ned.
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR
will hire you back this afternoon.
We'll see about that.
Ned could be any employee in any one
of our clients' locations worldwide.
Strategy packets
will be shipped in advance.
Ned will be given a seat and find one
of our transition specialists waiting.
Mr Laskin,
we're having this conversation
as your position is no longer available.
<i>I don't understand. I'm fired?</i>
Hearing the words
"You've been let go" is never easy.
Change is scary,
but consider the following:
anybody who ever built an empire or
changed the world sat where you are now.
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.
That's my fucking line.
<i>But what happens now?</i>
This is the first step of a process that
ends with you in a job that fulfils you.
<i>Yeah, but how does it work?</i>
Take the packet in front of you.
Review it - all the answers
you're looking for are inside.
Fill out the necessary information and
you're on the way to new opportunities.
Ned, go back to your desk
and start putting together your things.
As a favour to me, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread the news just yet.
Panic doesn't help anyone.
<i>I understand.</i>
Give it up for Ned.
You can start the morning in Boston,
stop in Dallas over lunch,
and finish the day in San Francisco.
All for the price of a T1 line.
Our inflated travel budget
is eviscerated by 85%.
And more importantly,
to you guys on the road,
no more Christmases in a hotel in Tulsa,
no more hours lost to weather delays.
You get to come home.
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.
That's why I brought the entire company in
from the road,
because we're not taking it seriously.
There is a methodology to what I do,
a reason it works.
Coke and IBM have been doing this
for years. Familiar with them?
Like anything else, it'll take a few months
of transition and everybody will settle in.
Who are you taking off the road?
- How are you not getting this?
You are grouned.
Everybody's grounded. It's done.
What we do here is brutal
and it does leave people devastated.
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.
By stabbing them in the chest
instead of the back, right?
You wanted to see me?
- Well, uhm...
You know what? Yeah, come on in.
- Great job out there.
Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
- Great.
Listen, I admire your...zeal.
And I think you have some very good ideas.
But you know nothing
about the realities of my industry.
You can set up an iChat,
but you don't know how people think.
I minored in psychology.
- Nice.
OK, kiddo, fire me.
- Ryan...
If she's gonna do this regularly, don't
you wanna know if she can fire people?
She's fired Ned.
- My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.
You don't need to do this.
- No, it's OK. I got this.
Mr Bingham,
I regret to inform you that your position
at this company is no longer available.
Hm. Who the hell are you?
My name is Miss Keener. I'm here
today to discuss your future.
My future? The only one who can fire me
is Craig Gregory.
He hired me to handle this for him.
- Handle what? Handle Me?
Mr. Gregory hired me,
he's the only one who can fire me.
Know what? I'm gonna go talk to him.
- Mr Bingham...
No, no. You can't follow me.
You're on a computer screen, remember?
Ryan..
- Let's try this again. Fire me again.
I just did.
- Actually, you didn't. Fire me.
That's enough. We get it.
Mr Bingham, I'm here to inform you
your position is no longer available.
I'm fired?
- Yes, you're fired.
Never say fired.
- You've been let go.
Why?
This is a mythical situation.
How could I possibly know why?
Why doesn't matter,
you never know why.
Don't focus on the why. Rather, spend
your energy thinking about your future.
Well, I'm gonna spend
my energy on suing you
unless you give me a good
reason why you're firing me.
Mr. Bingham, the reason's not important.
You're firing me without grounds?
I have a lawsuit.
I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.
- Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.
Personally?
This is the most personal situation
you are ever gonna enter,
so before you try to revolutionise my business,
I'd like to know
that you actually know my business.
That's a hell of a way
to welcome her to the team.
Am I the only one that sees that by doing
this we're making ourselves irrelevant?
No, frankly,
we're making you irrelevant.
Nice.
- Don't blame me.
Blame high fuel costs, blame insurance
premiums, blame technology.
Watch it. You're a little too young
to become a dinosaur.
I'm not a dinosaur.
- I want you to show her the ropes.
What do I know what goes on here?
Get Ferguson to do it.
I'm not talking about here.
No.
- Yeah.
You're very confident
this girl doesn't know what she's doing. So...
I'm sorry. I don't think a MySpace page
qualifies you to rewire a company.
Here's your chance. Go out, show her
the magic, take her through the paces.
I'm not a fucking tour guide.
Now here we go.
- Bingham, here's the boat.
And here's you.,
Do you want to be in the boat?
Yeah, alone.
We're ringing the bell,
we're rounding everybody up.
You want to stay out a bit longer, you're
welcome, but you will not be alone. Oké?
You let me know.
Oh, Christ.
What?
- Follow me.
I really like my luggage.
That's exactly what it is - luggage.
Know how much time you lose
checking in?
I don't know. Five...10 minutes?
- 35 minutes a flight.
I travel 270 days a year.
That's 157 hours.
That makes seven days.
Willing to throw away an entire week on that?
You don't need this.
Sorry, you don't need that.
You don't need that.
They have neck pillows on the plane.
This - they have better ones there.
I'll get rid of this.
I can just meet you at security.
Thank you.
Bingo - Asians.
You can't be serious.
- Never get behind people with infants.
I've never seen a stroller collapse
in less than 20 minutes.
Old people are worse.
They're littered with hidden metal
and they never appreciate
how little time they have left on earth.
Five words: randomly selected
for additional screening.
Asians, they pack light, travel efficiently,
and
they've got a thing for slip-on shoes.
That's racist.
- I'm like my mother, I stereotype. It's faster.
<i>What in your backpack?
Ryan Bigham.</i>
Are you mad at your computer?
I type with purpose.
What is it that you're working on
so furiously?
I'm building a workflow
of firing techniques.
It's questions and responses,
actions and reactions.
A script taking you through the steps
of firing someone.
Who's it for?
Well, theoretically,
you could put it in the hands
of anyone and they'd be downsizing immediately.
All you have to do is follow the steps.
Natalie,
what is it you think we do here?
We prepare the newly-unemployed for
the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting,
while minimising legal blowback.
That's what we're selling.
It's not what we're doing.
OK, what are we doing?
- We are here to make limbo tolerable,
to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread
until the point where hope is dimly visible.
Then stop the boat, shove 'em
in the water and make 'em swim.
That's really impressive.
Are you gonna put that in your book?
I gotta grab this.
I'll meet you at the car rental.
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.
I'm in Hotlanta and I need
a rib-joint recommend bad.
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.
You never called.
- I wasn't sure what was appropriate.
Appropriate? I'm not some waitress
you banged in a snowstorm.
<i>That word has no place
in our vocabulary.</i>
I'm the woman that you don't have
to worry about.
Sounds like a trap.
- Listen...
the next time that you're worried
about manners, don't.
If you wanna call, call.
Just think of me as yourself, only with a vagina.
When am I gonna see you?
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD,
with a connection in ORD into SDF.
<i>Sorry.</i>
Yeah, tell me about it.
How long's your layover? They got
multiples into SDF. Could you push?
Yeah, I can push.
All you have to do today
is watch and listen.
And when I talk about a strategy
packet, hand them one of those.
Sounds great.
So although I wish I were here
with better news,
the fact is that you and I are
sitting here today because
this will be your last week
of employment at this company.
Why me?
- What am I supposed to do now?
Am I supposed to feel better
I'm not the only one losing my job?
This is ridiculous!
I have been a fine employee for over 10 years
and this is the way you treat me.
How do you sleep at night, man?
How?
How's your family?
They sleeping well at night?
Electricity still on?
Heat still on, refrigerator full of food?
Gas tank full of gas?
Going to Chuck E. Cheese
this weekend or something?
Not me.
No, my kids,
we're not gonna do anything.
What do you suggest I tell them?
Perhaps you're underestimating
the positive effect
your career transition
can have on your children.
The positive effect?
I make about 90 grand a year now.
Unemployment is what -
250 bucks a week?
Is that one of your positive effects?
We'll get to be cosier cos I'm not gonna
be able to pay my mortgage on my house.
So maybe we can move into a nice
fucking one-bedroom apartment somewhere.
And I guess without benefits,
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she,
you know, suffers from her asthma
that I won't be able to afford
the medication for.
Well...tests have shown that children under
moderate trauma have a tendency to
apply themselves academically...
..as a method of coping.
Go fuck yourself.
That's what my kids'll think.
Your children's admiration is important to you?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it was.
Well, I doubt they ever admired you,
Bob.
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed
to be consoling me?
I'm not a shrink, Bob.
I'm a wake-up call.
You know why kids love athletes?
- Cos they screw lingerie models?
No, that's why we love athletes.
Kids love athletes
because they follow their dreams.
Well, I can't dunk.
- No, but you can cook.
What are you talking about?
Your résumé says that you minored
in French culinary arts.
Most students,
they work on the fryer at KFC,
but you bussed tables
at Il Picador to support yourself.
Then you get out of college
and then you come and work here.
How much did they first pay you
to give up on your dreams?
27 grand a year.
- And when were you going to stop
and come back
and do what makes you happy?
Good question.
I see guys who work at the same
company for their entire lives,
guys exactly like you.
They clock in, they clock out,
and they never have a moment of happiness.
You have an opportunity here, Bob.
This is a rebirth.
If not for you, do it for your children.
He just waltzes in and cuts in line?
We reserve priority assistance
for our Hilton Honors members.
The promotions are great.
You should check it out.
Hungry much?
Our business expense
allots $40 each for dinner.
I plan on grabbing
as many miles as I can.
OK, you gotta fill me in on the miles
thing. What is that about?
Are you talking about...
like frequent flyer miles?
You really want to know?
- I'm dying to know.
I don't spend a nickel if I can help it
unless it somehow profits my mileage account.
So what are you saving up for -
Hawaii, South of France?
It's not like that.
The miles are the goal.
That's it?
You're saving just to save?
Just say I have a number in mind
and I haven't hit it yet.
That's a little abstract.
What's the target?
I'd rather not.
- Is it a secret target?
It's 10 million miles.
OK. Isn't 10 million just a number?
- Pi's just a number.
Well, we all need a hobby.
No, I... I don't mean to belittle your collection.
I get it. It sounds cool.
I'd be the seventh person to do it.
More people have walked on the moon.
Do they throw you a parade?
- You get lifetime executive status,
you get to meet the chief pilot,
Maynard Finch...
And they put your name on a plane.
Men get hard-ons putting their name on stuff.
You guy;s dont grow up.
It's like you need to pee on everything.
- Now who's stereotyping?
Fear of mortality. It's like,
yeah, you're gonna die one day.
Why is that singular to men?
Probably because you can't have babies.
- The baby argument.
If I had that many miles...
I would show up at an airport,
look at the destination board,
pick a place and go.
<i>Can't fall asleep.</i>
<i>Me too just laying here</i>
<i>You should rub one out.</i>
Thank you for the advice.
<i>Only fair if you do too</i>
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>
<i>Call me next tim so I can listen</i>
<i>Have sweet dreams about me.</i>
OK. Closer.
Way closer.
Still closer.
Closer.
Er...a little left.
Down a little.
Too far. Up. Up one more inch.
I don't get it. Why does your sister
want a fake photo?
My sister is kooky. She thinks
this is charming. It's like the gnome thing.
No, I mean, why would she want a fake photo
in front of St Louis airport?
Are you kidding - Lambert Field?
The Wright brothers flew through there.
That domed main terminal,
is the first of its kind, a precursor
of everything from JFK to de Gaulle.
Pretty sweet.
- Just take the picture.
Well, that's a keeper.
Let me see it.
Why she wants reminders of all the
places she hasn't been is beyond me.
I'm sure she'll be crushed
for having missed this airport.
Before Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,
he took off from that runway.
Wonder why they called it
the Spirit of St Louis?
No.
- Well...
<i>Do you know how fucked
this place is now?</i>
I am the one thing - the one thing-
preventing this place
from being totally fucked in the ass.
Sometimes they just need to vent.
Please, for the love of God,
can I fire the next one?
Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.
- I'm here to be fired, right?
Well, we're here
to talk about your future.
You don't have to sugar-coat it.
I get the drill.
What are they offering?
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly
worked out severance package.
Give me the bullet points.
It's actually pretty good -
three months' pay, six months' medical.
And a full year of placement services
through our CTC.
Placement services. That's generous.
Commonly it takes a month of searching
for every $10,000 you expect to earn in salary.
So I could be looking for a while.
- Not necessarily.
Don't even sweat it.
I'm pretty confident about my plans.
Really?
- Yeah.
There's this beautiful bridge
by my house.
I'm gonna go jump off it.
Natalie.
Hey!
Natalie!
People say these things all the time.
It's part of the trade.
They do?
- Yeah.
They say crazy things.
They get worked up.
She was really calm.
I think that's a good sign.
So they don't ever actually do it?
- No. No, it's just talk.
How do you know? Do you follow up?
- No, nothing good's gonna come of that, but..
I wouldn't worry about it.
This is what we do, Natalie. We take people
at their most fragile and we set them adrift.
Ready to go back in?
All right, let's go. Come on.
No, I'm fine. Tell me something sweet.
I'll be back soon. I'm not sure how long
this exercise is supposed to last.
No, I don't even think of him that way.
He's old.
I- I'm done?
- I wasn't expecting this. Not at all.
Just like that?
I'm disappointed that I've given
so much of my life...
This is not fair.
There are people way more qualified
than me now.
I don't know what to do
when I wake up tomorrow.
You OK?
Are we going?
- Yeah.
<i>This is how I start every day of my life.</i>
Now, this is gonna be a little difficult,
so stay with me.
You have a new backpack.
Only this time,
I want you to fill it with people.
Start with casual acquaintances,
friends of friends,
folks around the office.
And then the people you trust
with your most intimate secrets -
your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,
your brothers, your sisters,
your parents,
and finally your husband, your wife,
your boyfriend or your girlfriend.
You get them into that backpack.
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you
to light it on fire.
Feel the weight of that bag.
Make no mistake, your relationships are
the heaviest components in your life.
Do you feel the straps
cutting into your shoulders?
All those negotiations and arguments,
and secrets and compromises.
<i>You don't need to carry all that weight.</i>
<i>Why don't you set that bag down?</i>
Some animals were meant to carry each other,
to live symbiotically for a lifetime -
star-crossed lovers, monogamous swans.
We are not those animals.
The slower we move, the faster we die.
We are not swans.
We're sharks.
<i>Never?
- No.</i>
Ever?
- No.
You never want to get married?
- Nope.
Never want kids?
- Not a chance.
Ever?
- Never.
Is that so bizarre?
- Yes.
Yes, it is.
- I just don't see the value in it.
Right, sell it to me.
- What?
Sell me marriage.
OK, how about love?
- OK.
Stability, just somebody you can count on...
- How many stable marriages do you know?
Somebody to talk to,
someone to spend your life with.
I'm surrounded by people to talk to.
That won't change.
How about just not dying alone?
Starting when I was 12, we moved each
of my grandparents to a nursing facility.
My parents went the same way.
Make no mistake, we all die alone.
Now, those cult members in San Diego,
with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers...
they didn't die alone.
I'm just saying there are options.
Oh, fuck.
Brian left me.
All right.
OK. Ok. All right.
All right. Shh, shh.
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend.
This is Natalie.
I should give you both a moment.
No. No, that's fine.
I'm fine. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Maybe we should just all
go up to our rooms and freshen up.
Maybe a drink?
- Now you're talking.
<i>Brian: I think it's time we C othter people</i>
He broke up with you
with a text message?
Kind of like firing someone
over the internet.
What a weaselly prick.
- But what does that make me?
Someone who falls for a prick.
- We all fall for them.
Pricks are
spontaneous, unpredictable and fun.
Then we're surprised
when they turn out to be pricks.
I followed him to Omaha.
- You did?
I had a job waiting for me in San Francisco
when he got an offer from ConAgra.
He said we could start a life together.
So I followed him.
- To Nebraska?
I thought I'd be engaged by now.
No offence.
None taken.
- That's all right.
When I was 16,
I thought by 23 I'd be married,
maybe have a kid, corner office by day,
entertaining at night.
I was supposed to be driving
a Grand Cherokee by now.
Life can underwhelm you that way.
I mean, where did you
think you'd be by um...
It doesn't work that way.
- At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.
It can be counterproductive.
I don't want to say anything
anti-feminist.
I really appreciate
all your generation did for me.
It was our pleasure.
- Well done.
But sometimes it feels like,
no matter how much success I have,
it's not gonna matter
until I find the right guy.
You really thought
this guy was the one?
I could have made it work.
He um... He really fit the bill.
You know?
- The bill?
White collar, college grad.
Loves dogs, likes funny movies.
Six-foot-one, brown hair, kind eyes,
works in finance but is outdoorsy...
you know, on the weekends.
I always imagined he'd have a single
syllable name like Matt or John...
or Dave.
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner, and
and the only thing he loves
more than me is his golden lab.
And a nice smile.
What about you?
- Let me think.
Honestly, by the time you're 34, all the
physical requirements go out the window.
Like you secretly pray
that he'll be taller than you.
Not an asshole would be nice. Someone who
enjoys my company, comes from a good family.
You don't think about that
when you're younger.
I don't know...
someone who wants kids.
Likes kids. Wants kids
Healthy enough to play with his kids.
Please let him earn more money
than I do.
You might not understand that now,
but believe me, you will one day.
Otherwise that's a recipe for disaster.
And hopefully some hair on his head.
But I mean even that's not
a deal breaker these days.
A nice smile.
Yeah, a nice smile.
Nice smile just might do it.
Wow, that was depressing.
I should just date women.
- Tried it.
We're no picnic ourselves.
I don't mind being married
to my career.
And I don't expect it to hold me in bed
as I fall asleep.
I just don't want to settle.
You're young. Right now you see
settling as some sort of a failure.
It is...by definition.
But by the time someone is right
for you, it won't feel like settling.
And the only person left to judge you
will be the 23-year-old girl
with a target on your back.
So what's the plan for the evening?
Well, we were gonna hit that party
for the tech conference at the hotel.
I didn't know you could just attend
those. I thought you had to register.
Technically,
I don't think it's open to the public.
Stop by.
- You're gonna crash it?
have a good time, usually.
- No, no, I get it. I'm in.
Jennifer Chu?
Shit!
- Ah, it'll be fine.
Doing all right?
Yeah. This was a great idea.
You're so pretty.
You're exactly
what I wanna look like in 15 years.
Thank you, Natalie.
- You should dance.
Come on.
- No, no, no.
Come on.
- Oh!
I'm Dave.
- I'm Natalie.
Who's Jennifer?
I don't know.
<i>How's everybody doing out there?</i>
Right about now, give it up
for a very special alphaTECH guest.
Young MC!
What's up, alphaTECH?
I got a busted computer.
Can somebody fix it for me?
