Once in a lifetime. you meet a man
so fearless, no m_n can touch him.
While you're waiting for him,
you can practice on me.
As sure as the sun will rise.

He could be here. It could be today.
Yeah!
lt could be you.

- Ty him and see!
Go on, Mark. But don't hurt him.
So, you're Mark. are you?

You don't have to kill me to win.

- Don't you wory about that_
Can l give you some advice?
Don't drop your sword.
ls this your sword?
Give him a hand_
- Well done. Mark_
- How did you do that?
- Was that a trick?
- No. That's the way l fight.
Could l do it?
Tell me. I can learn.
Study your opponent. so you know
what he'll do before he does it.
- I can do that.
- And wait for the critical moment.
- I can do that.
- You can't care about your life.
Come on_ Quickly_
Shut the doors_
Where's Daddy?
Burn it down.
We'll be burnt alive_
We need water_ Get water_
- No_ Wait till they've gone_
- We'll be dead by then_
Malagant.
Last night. men from this village
killed ihree of my people.
ln reprisal.
I have destroyed yo_r village.
The borderlands have been lawless
Iong enough.
Know now, that I am the law_
Come on_
There she is.
Mind the dog_
- Come here. milady.
- Wait.
- Milady ...
- l won't be much longer.
There's been another attack.
Another border village burnt.
Anne, take my place.
- Is it Malagant again?
- Yes. A small group got away.
- Are they being looked after?
- They want to see you first.
No. no. please. You poor people,
_ftemsuch a terrible journey.
We didn't know
where else to turn, milady.
They say we're outlaws.
They say we crossed the border.
I know. It's all lies. He means
to frighten us into submission.
- Don't give in to him. We'll fight.
- l'm not the yielding kind.
Jacob. Take these good people in
and give them food and drink.
When you've rested. we shall pray
for your village and'for Leonesse.
- God keep you safe. milady.
- And you. Now,' go.
- It's the third village he's burnt.
- Does he want to destroy us all?
- He wants us to sign his treaty.
- He thinks we won't challenge him.
If he doesn't get what he asks,
he has the power to take it.
Oswald ...
You say nothing.
- You know what I think. child.
- Yes, l suppose I do.
- Prince Malagant must be answered.
- He will be. I shall decide today.
Now leave me.
Oswald, stay.
- I had hoped to have more time.
- Don't you know your own heart?
I know what I want.
I want to mary.
I want to live and die in Leonesse.
But I can't have eveything I want,
can l?
Forgive me. but an offer of marriage
from Arthur of Camelot ...
Yes. I know.
You're right, of course.
No more words. Let it be done.
- You accept the offer?
- I shall mary Arthur of Camelot.
I was so proud to hold you
in my arms at your birth.
I shall be prouder still
to see you wed.
Poor Arthur. The only dowy
l bring him is a land in danger.
- But I shall love him. Oswald.
- You should, child.
l could never mary a man
without love.
Arthur wears his power so lightly.
He has such gentleness in his eyes.
l've never known anyone like him.
How could l love anyone more?
Halt_
lt could be an ambush.
Look to the trees_
Protect the carriage_
Don't break the line.
Wait_ Wait_
Now_

lt's all right.
They're going.

We've got to jump!
Come on, Elise!
Roll when you hit the ground!
Petronella, come on!
You have to!
Hury!
Save yourself!
It's me they'll follow!
She must have gone to ground.
She can't be far.
There!
Don't move.
- Who are you?
- Who cares?
Kill him!
- What is it?
- There were three.
Don't even breathe.
You ... drop the sword.
- Can I have her when you're done?
- You were after the woman?
Of course. Have you ever seen
anything so beautiful?
- l don't know about that.
- You don't want her?
Her soft skin. sweet lips ...
young, firm body.
- I have my orders.
- Who's to know?
- l should take her back.
- l'll hold her for you.
- It won't take long.
- l don't want any trouble.
This one's no trouble.
Look at her. She wants it.
- What's she doing?
- See for yourself. Turn her around.
Look into her eyes.
See what she's got for you.
Hello, pretty.
Now ... what have you got for me?
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Why did you risk your life for me?
They could have killed you.
l'm not that easy to kill.
Do you know who I am?
Guinevere. l'm the Lady of Leonesse.
Well? Doesn't it please you to know
you saved the life of a lady?
- l'd be happy to save a daiy maid.
- She couldn't reward you.
lf she were as pretty as you,
she could.
- What did l do?
- You insulted me.
Now l've insulted you.
How dare you treat me like this?
l take it you know no better.
You have done me a good service
and I shall forget the matter.
- Which way?
- l've never been here before.
- How do you know where the road is?
- l'm guessing.
See the scavenger birds?
They're looking for small animals
crushed by the passing wagons.
- About this reward ...
- My man will pay you.
- l don't want money.
- l'm on my way to be married.
Then you're not married yet.
You're free.
- l've given my word.
- l don't want your word.
- I want you.
- l'm not to be had for the wanting.
Why not? If you want me.
- You may impress servant girls ...
- I can tell when a woman wants me.
- I can see it in her eyes.
- Not in my eyes.
- You're afraid. aren't you?
- I have nothing to hide.
Then look at me.
lf there is any honour in you.
promise me never to do that again.
l don't know about honour.
But l promise you ... l won't
kiss you again until you ask me to.
And that l never will.
- When do you get married?
- On Midsummers Day.
Before Midsummers Day dawns,
you'll ask me to kiss you again.
- You insult me. then abandon me?
- That's the road ahead.
And that. l presume.
is your biave escort'.
- My child ... Thank the Lord.
- Are my ladies safe?
- Were you followed, milady?
- No.
No, there's no one there.
Your new county awaits you.
- If anything should happen ...
- l'll send word. Never fear.
Send Jacob. I want to know at once,
good news or bad. Promise me.
l promise you.
l promise you.
Lady Guinevere of Leonesse.
Welcome to Camelot.
God be praised. you're safe.
Nothing shall ever harm you again.
My Lord honours me
with his kindness.
Your coming brings me a happiness
I had not dared hope for.
My Lord must not think too highly
of me, lest he'll be disappointed.
Then l'll take you as l find you,
if you'll do as much for me.
Leonesse awaits news of your safety.
John will send any message you want.
My Lord grants my wishes
before l speak them.
Tell my people l'm come safe
into my new county.
Tell them you saw my eyes
filled with tears ofjoy.
Already a queen.
- Agravaine. what happened?
- Am'bush, sire.
- Malagant?
- It has to be.
- Was Lady Guinevere in danger?
- We were all in danger, sire.
There were wo separate forces.
- Lady Guinevere was in danger.
- You weren't prepared for them?
So many fell in the first strike.
How could we guess
they had a second force?
Malagant doesn't care how many men
he loses, so long as he wins.
- l'll not fail you again. sire.
- We both know no one is perfect.
- But l need to know eveything.
- Sire.
Come.
l first climbed this hill as a boy
and saw what was to become my city.
l named it Camelot.
- It's so beautiful it frightens me.
- Why do you say that?
I was brought up
to set no faith in finey.
''Beauty doesn't last'',
my father said.
l remember the way he looked at you.
l remember him saying, -
- ''Do all fathers think
their daughters are so beautiful?''
He never said that to me.
Camelot.
Good girl ...
Thank you!
You saved me from a long ride.
God knows when she'd have stopped.
- She's a fine animal.
- Fit for a queen.
- l'm Peter. King's stableman.
- Lancelot. Which king?
rhe King. Arthur of Camelot.
This beauty is a gift for his bride.
People swore he would never mary,
but l knew better.
He was iust waiting
for the right one. Like we all do.
There'll be some feasting today!
Come on! The party's started!
Beat the gauntlet and meet the King!
Who's got the heart of a lion?
Be the first
to get through the gauntlet, -
- and you'll be up there drinking,
as if he's your brother!
Get up here! Get padded up
and beat the gauntlet!
What about you boys out there?
Give your support
to this brave, young man!
Beat the gauntlet
and meet our lovely queen!
Will you give the victor a kiss,
milady?
How's that? Beat the gauntlet and
win a kiss from Lady Guinevere, -
- soon to be our lovely queen!
Who will it be?
Not like that. idiot!
Come and get padled up first!
Get down! You're mad!
You'll kill yourself!
Go on!
Yes!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
- Extraordinay. What's your name?
- Lancelot.
Lancelot.
We won't forget that name.
Your prize ...
-Ask me.
- No.
Ask me.
Never.
l dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
l only have one heart to lose.
Come.
Well done.
- Have you run the gauntlet before?
- No, never.
- How did you do it?
-You have to see the danger coming.
Others have found it vey hard.
You're the first one to do it.
Perhaps fear made them go back
instead of forward.
- And you felt no fear?
- No. I have nothing to lose.
No home ... family?
Do you have a profession?
- l live by my sword.
-You fight for pay.
Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
l knew l could do it, so l did it.
Well. Lancelot ...
you're an unusual man.
l've never seen such a display of
courage, skill, -
- nerve, grace and ... stupidity.
Come.
Here. every life is precious.
even the lives of strangers#
lf you must die. die serving
something greater than yourself.
Better still.
live ... and see.
- The Round Table.
- Yes.
The High Council meets here.
No head. no foot.
Eveyone equal '... even the King.
''ln serving each other,
we become free_'
That is the vey heart of Camelot.
Not these stones. timbers,
towers, pal_ces.
Burn them all ...
and Camelot lives on.
Because it lives in us.
It's a belief we hold in our hearts.
Well, no matter.
- Stay in Camelot. l invite you.
- l'll be on the road again soon.
- What road?
- Wherever chance takes me.
Do you believe that what you do
is a matter of chance?
- Yes.
- In that hallway are wo doors.
- How will you choose beween them?
- It won't matter. It's all chance.
l hope chance leads you to the left.
It's the only way out.
Lancelot!
Just a thought ...
A man who fears nothing
is a man who loves nothing.
And if you love nothing.
what joy is there in your liie?
l may be wrong.
Peter!
Show us how she goes.
- She's yours.
- She's beautiful.
Peter thinks
she's not suitable for a lady.
- l would have chosen her myself.
- I know.
- How do you know?
- Remember when you joined our hunt?
- You were fearless.
- My fathers word was ''reckless''.
He was always sparing with praise.
Come.
- We could almost be alone here.
- Do you have secrets to tell me?
No. No secrets.
Just a question to ask.
Do you want to mary me?
You don't have to mary me
because your father wanted it.
Camelot will protect Leonesse,
whether you mary me or not.
Thank you.
You don't know what it means to me
to hear you say that.
Do you want to be released
from the engagement?
No. I want to mary you.
Not your crown or your army
or your golden city. Just you.
- Just me?
- Yes. If you love me.
- Do you remember this?
- You hurt it in the hunt.
- l didn't think you'd get a scar.
- Just a scratch.
You wiped the blood away
with a sleeve of your dress.
The sleeve still carries the stain.
l never thought until then how sweet
it must be to be loved by one woman.
And for the first time in my life,
I wanted ...
- What?
- What wise men say doesn't last.
What cannot be promised. or made
to linger any more than iunlight.
But l don't want to die. without
having felt its warmth in my face.
Mary the King. Guinevere,
but love the man.
l only know one way to love.
And that is body ... and heart ...
and soul.
l kiss the hurt
that brought me your love.
Ty her.
- Shall l fetch a lady's saddle?
- No need.
- She's a rare beauty, sire.
- Yes, she is.
So is the mare.
May God grant us the wisdom
to discover the right, -
- and the strength
to make it endure.
As you alI know.
I am soon to be mariied.
- And about time, too.
- Hear!
We have had our share of war.
Now, I look forward to quieter days.
But first, admit our guest.
- Malagant ...
- Malagant is here at my invitation.
May l congratulate the King
on his forthcoming marriage.
l see my place
hasn't been taken yet.
- I was first among your knights.
- You left of your own free will.
We each of us
must follow our own road.
Where does your road take you?
To Leonesse?
Leonesse is my neighbour. l offered
the lady a treaty of friendship.
- Is burning villages friendship?
- Yes, My Lady ...
Your land is becoming lawless.
Were you not just attacked?
- You know who attacked me.
- l made it my business to know.
- Justice has been done.
- You know no law above yourself!
''Armed forces to be given access
to all Leonesse!'
''Troops to assist in the enforcement
of law ... in all Leonesse!'
- Do you want to sign this?
- l'll never sign it.
She's vey brave ...
now she's to be married.
- Will Camelot protect Leonesse?
- Is Leonesse in need of protection?
Come. Arthur.
l'm here to setile this business.
Leonesse is too weak to stand alone.
Let's say half each.
The lesser gives way to the greater.
What nation is greater than Camelot?
The land ofiustice.
Come ... your hand on it.
We'll all live together as friends.
You offer me
what isn't yours to give.
You alI know me.
You know l'm a man of my word.
Don't make an enemy of me.
- l mean no harm to Camelot.
- You know the law we live by.
Where is it written.
beyond Camelot live lessei people?
People too weak
to protect themselves, let them die?
Other people live by other laws.
Or does your law rule the world?
There are laws that enslave men,
and laws that set them free.
Either what we hold to be right
and good and true -
- ís right and good and true
for all mankind under God, -
- or we're iust a robber tribe.
Your words are talking you
out of peace and into war.
There's a peace you only find
after war.
lf that battle must come,
l will fight it!
-And I!
-And I!
The great Arthur ...
and his great dream.
No dream lasts forever.
- What is the status of the army?
- Four battalions, wo in reserve.
- l'll double the watch.
- l don't think Malagant wants war.
Arm the reserves.
He wants war.
- He wants Leonesse as a buffer.
- He wants Camelot.
- How soon could he attack?
- His army is five days' march away.
So much for my quieter days.
Who approaches there?
I come with a message
for Lady Guinevere!
Enter.
- My Lady. it's Jacob.
- Where?
- Coming to the north gate.
- Leonesse ...
Jacob ...
- Mind the step.
- Jacob, what is it?
They've taken Lady Guinevere_
Taken? Taken where?
A boat, sire. From the north gate
into the forest.
I have scouts and dogs out already.
Give me a battalion of guards.
- Give me the men.
- No, that's exactly what he wants.
- Take one brigade, now_
- Sire.
He'll not harm her. sire.
She's too valuable.
- He'll ty to trade her first.
- That's what l'm afraid of.
l'd give my life for her.
But what if he asks for more?
Welcome to my palace ... My Lady.
l think we can release the lady
from her bonds.
lf she so wishes.
What's this?
Your dress is torn. Ralph ...
l gave orders that the lady
was not to be harmed.
Your dress is quite spoiled.
You ...
... almost ...
... a aUeen.
Ralph. Did you do this?
- Yes. My Prince.
- You see?
This is
what Arthur doesn't understand.
Men don't want brotherhood,
they want leadership.
Shall we?
This was once
the greatest castle ever built.
Now grass grows in the halls
where kings once feasted, -
- and peasants cart away the walls
to make shelters for their pigs.
- Such is gloy.
- What do you mean to do with me?
Keep you
till Arthur becomes reasonable.
He won't trade Leonesse for my life.
l'd rather die. Arthur knows that.
Self-sacrifice is vey easy.
But sacrificing someone you love
puts your convictions to the test.
l'm sure Arthur will come round
to the merits of compromise.
This is called an oublíette.
That's French
for a place of forgetting.
Your quarters. My Lady.
No gates, no bais, no locks.
Just walls of air.
You can come out_
I'm unarmed and alone_
- Who are you?
- A messenger from the King.
- He came alone?
- Yes, My Prince.
- What is your message?
- Is Lady Guinevere unharmed?
She's unharmed. l give you my word.
- l need to see it with my own eyes.
- My word isn't good enough?
l'm a common man.
l don't have much use for words.
He does have a message. Take him
to the pit, then bring him back.
- You've seen her. Let's go.
- No.
- l stilI have a message to deliver.
- All right. We'll drag you back.
Jump on_ Jump_
Come on_ Jump_
lf the water can get out,
so can we. Come on.
No_ Hold on_
Shoot_
Why have we stopped?
- l'm tired.
- Never.
You battle in your dreams.
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.
Now, drink.
Again.
- Where did you learn to do that?
- l lived most of my life outdoors.
Don't you have a home?
No. l don't have a home.
Not for a long time.
- That must be hard.
- Why must it be?
l'm my own master.
l go where l please.
Why build a house
for the warlords to burn?
ls that how it happened?
God save you from such a day.
How old were you?
Mother_
Father_
lt was long ago.
- God save us all from such a day.
- He didn't save me.
- Ah. but he did.
- ior what?
lt's made you who you are.
A man who fears nothing and no one.
You can use that gift.
If not, you might as welI have died.
You don't know how many times
l've wished for that.
But you didn't die. You lived.
- Tell me what to do.
- Your life is your own.
l give it to you.
You forget l'm to be married.
lf you could freely do as you
pleased, would you mary Arthur?
- I am free. As free as you are.
- Prove it.
- How?
- Forget who you are.
Let all the world go away ...
and all the people in it, but us.
Do what you want to do.
Here. Now.
There she is_
Thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you. You can go.
You must have better things to do.
You have given me back my life.
I can at least give you your shirt.
- Tell me what you want. It's yours.
- l did what any man would do.
You risked your life for another.
There is no greater love.
You have deceived me.
But now ... I know the truth.
You care nothing for yourself.
No wealth, no home, no goal, -
-iust the passionate spirit
that drives you on.
God uses people like you.
Because your heart is open,
you give all of yourself.
lf you knew me better.
you wouldn't say such things.
l take the good with the bad.
I can't love people in slices.
Now, no more protests.
Let me thank you in my own way.
They are welcoming you back.
We owe Lady Guinevere's life
to one man.
Lancelot.
l believe he comes to Camelot
for a purpose, -
- even though
he doesn't know it himself.
What l'm about to offer this man
is already his.
One seat stands empty.
- You'd make him a knight. sire?
- l offer no life of privilege.
lt's a life of service.
If you want it, it's yours.
- We don't know anything about him.
- Perhaps we should discuss ...
Enough! What do you say?
Will you join us?
My Lord, if l may speak?
l owe this man
more than anyone here.
He deserves any honour
you can give him.
But he doesn't belong in Camelot.
He's a man who goes his way alone.
ln that freedom and solitude
is his strength.
lf you wish to honour him.
as l do, with all my heart, '-
- let's honour him as he is.
Let him go. alone and free ...
and with our love.
Well ... Lancelot?
Lady Guinevere understands me well.
But here, among you, -
- I have found something
that I want more than freedom.
lt would break my heart
to leave you.
Bravo! Then you'll join us?
- Yes.
- Welcome.
This is only the beginning.
Go pass this night in prayer, -
- for tomorrow you'll be born again,
into a new life.
- Why?
- You know why.
- Please leave Camelot.
- I want to be where you are.
You must not say such things to me.
Say nothing.
l will leave Camelot now,
if you come with me.
- No.
- Then tell me you don't love me.
l don't love you.
Arise, Sir Lancelot.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and deaih.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and deaih.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and deaih ...
l swear to love and serve Guinevere,
my true and rightful queen.
I swear to love and serve Guinevere.
and to protect her honour as my own.
Jacob ...
Forgive me. milady.
Black Malagant has'taken Leonesse.
Leonesse ...
The gates are open.
- Make camp for the night.
- Where, sire?
There.
lt's too exposed. sire.
We could never possibly defend it.
Sire.
They're not here.
There's no one here_
Draw_
Loose_
Charge_
Attack_
- Archers in position, sire.
- Hold position.
- Their left wing is falling back.
- Second battalion to the left_
ls our centre holding?
Charge_
- They're breaking. sire.
- Do not give ch_se.
- First battalion regrouped? sire.
- Sound the advance.
- They're running. Do we follow?
- No. Let them go.
On to Leonesse_
Well done.
Your sword ... Sir Lancelot.
No_
No_
- Come out.
- They're alive.
You're safe. Don't be afraid.
We're glad you're safe.
There's a step. Be careful.
God bless you, sir.
l'm so old now ...
Can l go home now?
Can l go home now?
Yes.
Yes, you can go home now.
Bless you, milady.
Elise ...
l've come to say goodbye,
and wish you well.
lt's been a long night.
You've not slept.
- Where will you go?
- Wherever the road leads.
When shall we see you again?
l don't think l'll be coming back.
Never?
Never.
I know what l must do now.
l never believed in anything before.
But l do believe in Camelot.
And l will serve it best by leaving.
Tell the King. I'll always remember
that he saw the best in me.
And what shall l tell myself?
There was once a man who loved you
too much to change you.
l'll not forget him.
l sheltered under a tree
with him once ... in the rain.
Lancelot ...
- My Queen.
- l owe you a kiss.
l'm asking you.
Why?
Why?
The King asks for you, milady.
l ask you not to lie to me.
even if you think you'll hurt We.
- Have you given yourself to him?
- No, My Lord.
Do you love him?
Yes.
- How did l fail you?
-You've never failed me, My Lord.
l saw your face as you kissed him.
Love has many faces. l look on you
differently, but not with less love.
When a woman loves wo men.
she must choose beween theW.
- l choose you.
- Your will chooses me.
- Your heart chooses him.
- My will is stronger than my heart.
Do you think l put so high a price
on my feelings? They'll pass.
My will holds me
to my course through life.
As mine does me. and yet.
all I have to do is look at you -
- and eveything l ever believed in
fades to nothing.
- All I want is your love.
- You have it.
Do l? Then look on me
as you looked on him.
l gave one moment to Lancelot.
Yes. you're innocent.
But you love him_
Any more of this innocence
and l'll go mad.
- l'll do whatever you tell me to.
- l don't know what to think.

Am l to hide in dark corners
as if l'm ashamed?
Open the gates.
I want eveyone there.
Let evey citizen see

Queen of Camelot, -

an act of treason against Camelot, -

My Lord.
The Queen ís innocent.
But if my life, or my death, -
- serves Camelot. Take it.
Do what you like with me.
Brother to brother.
yours in life and deaih.
ls it the King's wish

Guards_
Close the gates_
Nobody move or Arthur dies_
My men control the city gates.

Look at him_ Look at the great
King Arthur of Camelot.
He's a man waking up from a dream.

He makes us strong only for a while,
so we can help each other.
My God makes me strong
so I can live my life_

When will you live your own lives?
This is the freedom l bring you_
Freedom from his tyrannical dream_
Freedom from his tyrannical law_
Freedom from his tyrannical God_
I want your people
to see you kneel before me here.
Kneel before me, or die.
Too proud. Arthur? Do you think
you serve your people better dead?
I have no pride left in me.
What l do now.
l do for my people, and for Camelot.
And may they forgive me.
This is my last act as your king.
Do not be afraid.
All things change.
I am Arthur of Camelot.
