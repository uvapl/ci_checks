We just got married!
They just got married.
This is the Plaza Hotel, please.
- Plaza? Corie, it's the Plaza.
- Wait a minute, I'm not finished.
- Corie, the man is waiting.
- Give him a big tip.
Paul, you're not sorry we're married?
After 40 minutes? Give it an hour.
If the honeymoon doesn't work out,
let's not get divorced.
Let's kill each other.
Let the maid do it,
I hear the service here is wonderful.
- Here's...
- Thank you.
Come on.
- Good afternoon.
- Yes.
My hand. I need my hand.
- Mr Paul Bratter.
- Yes.
And is Mrs Bratter staying with you?
My mother?
Mrs Bratter, yes.
Mr and Mrs Bratter.
How long are you staying, Mr Bratter?
- Six days.
- And nights.
It's a pleasure
to have you at the Plaza. 449.
Corie, that's... Stop, huh?
This way, please.
Excuse us, please.
Mr Adams, I hope you realise
I'm only 15 years old.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Well, they're so stuffy around here.
Is this what life is going to be like
for the next 50 years?
Is that all we're going to be
married? That's not very long.
Wait, don't make rash judgements.
Paul, I think
I'm going to be a lousy wife.
But don't be angry with me. I love
you very much... and I'm very sexy.
Then let's go inside.
I'm paying $30 a day.
OK, Paul, let's start the marriage.
Good luck, Paul.
Good luck, Corie.
They're never coming out.
- How long's it been?
- Five days.
That must be a record.
For a political convention,
the honeymoon record is nine days.
Wait a minute, Paul.
Where are you going?
I have to work,
I don't do this for a living.
Can't you call
and tell them you're sick?
- I have to go.
- You promised you'd never leave.
It's just till 5.30, that's all.
If it's a good marriage
it'll last until 5.30.
See you tonight, hey?
What was that? A kiss?
Will you get inside -
this is a nice hotel!
Was that a kiss?
If that's what kisses are gonna
be like don't bother coming back.
I can't kiss you, my lips are numb.
Now, please go inside.
If you don't give me a real kiss
I'm gonna give you back your pyjamas.
Right now.
Couldn't you make it 4.30?
Tonight, at the new apartment.
It's 49 West 10th Street.
I love you!
Thank you, Mr Dooley.
Next time you're in New York just...
call me up.
Hello?
- Bratter?
- Up here! Top floor!
Top floor.
Take your time!
Top floor, it's always the top floor.
Whatever happened to elevators?
The bed is six feet long
and the room is five and a half feet
and I'm in big trouble.
Telephone company.
The phone? Oh, great, come on in.
That's... That's quite a climb.
Yes, it's five flights,
if you don't count the front stoop.
I counted the front stoop.
- Would you like some water?
- Please.
I'd offer you a soda or beer
but we don't have anything yet.
Water's fine.
Except we don't have any glasses.
You could put your head under
and just slurp.
No, I don't have
enough breath to slurp.
Well...
Where would you like the phone?
I don't know! Any suggestions?
Well, it depends
what you're gonna do with the room.
You gonna have furniture?
Sure.
Listen, give me a long extension cord
and I'll carry it around with me
for the first few years.
Good. I'll use the old connection.
You're really gonna live up here,
huh? I mean every day.
Every day.
I hope that's the man
with the furniture.
I don't wanna see this.
Hello, Bloomingdales?!
Lord and Taylor's!
Up here, top floor!
Oh, my gosh.
Probably another wedding gift
from my mother.
She sends them twice a day.
I hope it's an electric heater.
Is it cold in here?
I can't grip the phone.
Maybe the steamer's off.
Maybe that's it.
Turn it on, it'll come right up.
It is on. It's just not coming up.
Your husband have a lot of sweaters?
I prefer it this way. It's a medical
fact that steam heat's bad for you.
Yeah? In February?
Just put them down anywhere.
I know, I know.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
about the stairs.
He wants you to sign it.
Wait a minute.
Here you are.
Are you gonna be all right?
That's a shame,
giving a job like that to an old man.
He's probably only 25,
they age fast on this route.
OK, lady. You're in business.
My own phone. Can I make a call?
Your bill started two minutes ago.
Who can I call? I know.
I'm Harry Pepper. If you have
any phone trouble do me a favour -
don't ask for Harry Pepper.
What's the matter, bad news?
It is going to be cloudy tonight
with a light snow.
You'll be the first in the city
to see it fall.
Hello, is Mr Paul Bratter there,
please? This is Mrs Paul Bratter.
This is terrific, it works great.
Just like a real phone, huh?
Frank? Is Paul there?
Hi, Corie. He left about 20 minutes
ago and looked very tired.
Tell him to call me, I've got great
news if he can stand more excitement.
No kidding, what is it?
Frank, hang on, that may be him now.
I didn't want him to come
till after the furniture had arrived.
Corie? Where are you?
Paul? Up here!
Paul, up here, top floor!
It's him!
How long you been married?
Six days.
He won't notice it's empty till June.
So long, Gramercy 59971.
Have a nice marriage.
And may you soon have
many extensions.
Frank, he's on his way up. Can you
hang on for five more flights?
Hurry up, darling!
Don't expect too much -
the furniture hasn't gotten here yet.
And Paul, the paint
didn't turn out exactly right!
But I think it's gonna be beautiful!
Paul, are you all right?!
Coming. Coming.
- What?!
- He's coming, he's coming.
He's coming, he's coming.
Hi, sweetheart!
Paul, darling!
Oh, say something!
It's six...
It's six flights.
Did you know it's six flights?
It isn't, it's only five!
What about that big thing
hanging outside the building?
That's not a flight, it's a stoop.
It may look like a stoop
but it climbs like a flight.
Is that all you have to say?
I didn't think I'd get that much out.
It didn't seem like six flights
when I first saw the apartment.
Why is that?
You didn't see this apartment,
remember?
You saw the apartment
on the third floor.
- That's why.
- You don't like it.
You really don't like it.
- I'm waiting for my eyes to clear.
- I thought you'd say "Wow!"
I will... I will, I'm just...
Wow.
Paul, it's gonna be beautiful.
I promise you!
- Do you know what?
- What?
- I missed you.
- Really?
In the middle of the Monday morning
conference I began to...
Let's go back to the Plaza.
We have an hour till check-out!
We can't. You stole a towel
and three ashtrays, we're hot.
You know for a... For a lawyer
you're some good kisser.
- What?
- For a kisser I'm some good lawyer.
Something's happened.
Something's happened! Tell me, what?!
The office is gonna call
and let me know!
- They called - I called.
- When?
- Now.
- Where?
Over there, right over there,
they're on the phone.
Why didn't you tell me?
- You got me all crazy.
- Frank?
Yes, Frank, tell...
Very funny, Frank.
For a lawyer I'm some good kisser.
I'd love to listen all night
but we got work to do.
You got a case in court tomorrow.
Frank, are you kidding?
Do you mean this?
The whole thing?
Birnbaum versus Gump,
Marshall dumped it
in our eager and inexperienced hands.
Our chance to get the key
to the executive washroom!
We're a cinch!
I'll go over the briefs tonight.
I'll meet you at eight in the morning
to go over everything.
Think I have time
to grow a moustache?
Did you hear? Did you hear?!
My first case!
I'm going to be a lawyer!
That's great, Paul.
You have to work tonight?
This furrier's suing a woman for
non-payment. I've got the furrier.
I have a black lace night-gown.
He made four tailored coats for this
woman. Now she doesn't want them.
She's 4'8" - he'd have to sell them
to a rich midget.
And I thought I'd put on a record
and do a Cambodian fertility dance.
There's no signed contract -
what's happening, what is this?
I'm trying to get you
hot and bothered
and you're summing up for the jury!
The whole marriage is over!
Corie, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm just excited - you want me
to be rich and famous, don't you?
During the day,
at night I want you here and sexy.
Tell you what, tomorrow, your night,
whatever you like, all right?
- Something wild, crazy and insane?
- Fine.
- Like what?
- We'll wallpaper each other.
But tonight I've got to work.
Please? OK?
So where do I sit?
The furniture'll be here
in a minute, Paul.
What about tonight?
I'm in court tomorrow.
Maybe we ought to check into a hotel.
We just checked out of a hotel.
- I want to sleep in my apartment.
- Where, dear?
Only room for one in the bathtub.
Where's the bathtub?
There's a shower.
- How can I bath?
- Take a shower.
I don't like showers, I like baths.
How can I take a bath?
Lie down in the shower and hang
your feet over the sink.
It's freezing in here.
Isn't there any heat?
Of course, there's a radiator.
The radiator's
the coldest thing in the room.
- Is there a janitor?
- Only Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
It'll warm up with the furniture.
What about tonight?
I'm in court tomorrow.
It's not like you have a case
every morning! This is your first.
Well...
- What are you doing?
- Seeing if the windows are closed.
- Why is it windy?
- A draught?
No, wind. There's a brisk
north-easterly wind blowing.
- Don't get sarcastic.
- I'm not. I'm getting chapped lips.
How can it be windy in a closed room?
How's this for an answer,
there's a hole in the skylight.
Paul...
Paul, don't get excited.
We'll plug it up for tonight.
How? It's 20 feet high.
You'd have to fly over
and drop something in it.
It's only one night
and it's not that cold.
In February at three in the morning
it's freezing!
The weather bureau said
it's gonna be cloudy with light sn...
What? What? Light what?
Snow.
Snow? It's gonna snow tonight?
- Hmm? In here.
- They're wrong as often as right.
I'll be shovelling snow
in my own living room.
In the first place,
it's just a little hole.
- And secondly, what should I do?
- Go to pieces, like me.
It's natural.
I have a better idea.
I'm gonna keep you warm...
and there's no charge
for electricity.
Oh, all right.
Corie, I can't do this.
Would Corie be upset
if I just popped up and said hello?
Upset with her own mother? Why?
I do it all the time.
They're still practically
on their honeymoon.
She's probably dying for advice,
you know young brides.
Corie gives her own advice.
- All right, let's go home.
- I'll be 10 minutes.
No longer! I'll circle the block!
I see I haven't got much
of a law career ahead of me.
Good. I hope we starve.
I hope they find us dead
in each other's arms.
Frozen skinny lovers
found on 10th Street.
- Then we are in love again?
- Yes, we're in love again.
It's the bed.
I hope it's the bed.
Bloomingdales?
Surprise!
- Oh, she couldn't wait.
- Your mother?
I can't entertain her now,
I've got a case in court tomorrow.
She'll hate it, she'll think we're
gypsies living in an empty store!
Five minutes ago this place
was paradise, now it's Cannery Row.
She doesn't understand, Paul.
She's practical, not young like us.
Well, I'm 26 and cold as hell.
Sorry.
Paul, promise me one thing.
Don't tell her about the rent.
- Say you're not sure yet.
- All right.
Wait, I have to know what my rent is,
I'm a college graduate.
Can't you lie a little, for me?
Don't tell her it's 125.
- How much is it, then?
- 60.
- Six...?
- 65.
It's 75, all right?
$75 and 63 cents a month.
- All right.
- Including gas and electricity.
Will she believe that?
Anyone would.
The 125's hard to swallow.
Yes, hello?
Yes, it is.
You what?
Thank you for calling.
The furniture's
not coming till tomorrow
but they're sending some bedding.
It'll be all right.
Just don't let her stay too long,
I've got a case...
In court, I know.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Mom.
- I can't breath.
- Take it easy.
- I can't catch my breathe.
- You should've rested.
I did,
but there were always more stairs.
- Paul, help her.
- Watch the step.
More stairs?
- Would you like some water?
- No, thank you, dear.
I can't swallow yet. Oh, my.
It's not that high, Mother.
No, dear, not really.
What is it, nine flights?
Five, we don't count the stoop.
If I'd known the people on the third
floor I'd have gone to visit them!
Oh, mother,
what a pleasant surprise!
I'm not staying,
Aunt Harriet's waiting for me.
Just one good look round, that's all.
I'm not sure I'm coming back.
You can't tell anything yet, I wish
you'd arrived after the furniture.
Don't worry,
I've a marvellous imagination.
Well?
- Corie, baby, it's beautiful.
- You hate it!
No, I love it.
It's a charming apartment. I love it.
It's not your kind of apartment,
I knew it!
I love it.
Paul, didn't I say I loved it?
- She said she loved it.
- I knew I said it.
Are you absolutely crazy
in love with it?
Yes, it's very cute and there's
so much you can do with it.
I told you she hated it.
At least let me see
the whole apartment!
This is the whole apartment.
- It's a large room.
- There's a bedroom!
- Where?
- One flight up.
It's two little steps.
See? One, two... Three. Oh.
Split-level.
Where's the bedroom? Through here?
No, here. This is the bedroom.
It's really a dressing room
but I'll use it as a bedroom.
A wonderful idea,
and just put a bed in here.
- That's right.
- How?
- It'll fit, I measured the room.
- A double bed?
- No, a large single.
- Very nice.
Where will Paul sleep?
- With me.
- Large single?
You won't be able
to get to the closet.
- You will.
- Without climbing over the bed?
- You have to climb over the bed.
- Oh, that's a good idea.
- And hang clothes from the pipe.
- That's right.
Everything is temporary, Mother.
Harper's says "It won't take shape
"until the bride's personality
becomes clearly defined".
I don't know,
I think it's you right now.
What's in here?
Oh, the bathroom.
No bathtub.
This is the kitchen!
It's very cosy.
It's chilly in here.
Do you feel a draught?
Stand here, Mom, it's warmer.
Mother, you need a drink.
Paul, get a bottle of Scotch.
Now?
You have lots of wall space.
What colour will you paint it?
It's painted.
Very attractive.
I've got to go.
No, Mother, have a drink.
Paul, get the Scotch.
- One drink.
- I'll get the Scotch.
- Button up, it's cold.
- I've noticed.
- Get some cheese.
- Paul!
I just want to give my fella a kiss
and wish him luck.
- Thanks, Mom.
- It's beautiful.
- It's a perfect apartment.
- It is.
You do like it?
Where else can you get anything
like this for 75.63 a month?
Are you sure, Paul?
Six flights of stairs again.
It's the only way to travel.
Well?
Corie, baby, I'm so excited for you.
It's not the way you pictured, is it?
Well... it's unusual.
Like you.
When you were a little girl
you wanted to live on the moon.
I thought you were joking.
Well, drunk again, huh?
OK, I'll take care of him.
I know what let's do, let's open my
presents and see what you sent me.
Hey, what's in here?
That sounds expensive?
I think it's a broken clock.
Aunt Harriet helped me pick it out.
She thinks
I should move into New York.
That's an idea.
I said "Why, Harriet?
Just because I'm alone?
"I'm not afraid to live alone.
In some ways it's better," I said.
Does this pot come with directions?
If I'd known about this kitchen
it'd come with hot coffee.
Mother...
Oh, I love everything!
You've got to stop
sending me presents.
Start spending your money
on yourself.
Oh, myself.
What does a woman like me need,
living all alone
way out in New Jersey?
- You could travel.
- Oh, travel.
Alone.
At my age?
I read a story in The Times.
A middle-aged woman
travelling alone fell off a ship.
They never discovered it
till they got to France.
Mother...
I promise, if you fell off a ship
somebody would know about it.
You know what you really need?
Yes. I don't want to hear it.
- You're afraid of the truth.
- No, I'm afraid of the word you use.
You're darn right, it's love.
I didn't even know what it was,
then I spent six wonderful days
in the Plaza and what happened?
- I promised I wouldn't ask.
- I found love.
Spiritual, physical and emotional.
Nobody should be without it.
I'm not, darling. I have you.
- Not that kind of love, I mean...
- I know what you mean.
- And you won't discuss it.
- Not around you.
That must be Aunt Harriet.
- I've got to go.
- Some visit.
A sneak preview. I'll see you both
on Tuesday for the world première.
Oh, you shouldn't have run
just for me.
Goodbye, love.
I love your new apartment.
See you both on Tuesday.
Geronimo!
Paul, what's the matter?
I just had an interesting talk
with the man in the liquor store.
Some of the greatest weirdos in the
country live here in this building.
No kidding? Like who?
Well, the Boscoes in apartment 1 C,
Mr and Mrs J Boscoe.
- Who?
- A lovely young couple.
They just happen to be the same sex -
no one knows which one.
- In 3C are Mr and Mrs Gonzales.
- So?
And Mr and Mrs Armendariz and
Mr Calhoun, who must be the umpire.
- Who's in 4D?
- I don't know.
Nobody does.
Nobody's been seen in three years.
Except every morning there are nine
empty cans of tuna outside.
- So who is it?
- A big cat with a can opener.
Oh, I forgot Mr Victor Velasco,
he lives in 6A.
- Where's that?
- He lives in the attic.
He's 58, he skis, climbs,
married four times.
- The Bluebeard of 10th Street.
- What's that?
Either he attacks 10th Street girls
or he's got a blue beard.
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna stand in here and work.
If anything comes up, like the bed
or the heat, let me know.
Are you asleep?
Just my hands and my feet.
Paul, the trouble is
we're wearing too much clothing.
You know how the Eskimos keep warm?
They check into a motel?
Paul, do you hate me?
- Yes.
- Then say it.
I hate you.
And I hate you.
- There's somebody at the door!
- If it's the Red Cross, let them in.
Aren't you gonna answer it?
You found the apartment,
you answer it.
- Who are you?
- Who are YOU?
- I live here.
- So do I.
How delightful.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
My name is Velasco. Victor Velasco.
The Bluebeard? From the attic?
I was wondering
if I could use your bedroom?
The bedroom? No.
But I can't get into my apartment.
I wanted to use your window
and crawl out along the ledge.
- Did you lose your key?
- No, it no longer fits the lock.
The penalty of being
four months behind in the rent.
So, you say you live here?
Just moved in today.
Really.
And what are you, a folk singer?
No, a wife!
Oh. You know
you're unbearably pretty.
All indications point
to my falling in love with you.
I see our ratfink landlord
has left the hole in the skylight.
- He'll fix it, won't he?
- Don't count on it.
My bathtub has been leaking
since 1949.
Tell me, does your husband
work during the day?
- Yes.
- In an office?
- Yes.
- Good. I work at home in the day.
I predict interesting complications.
Am I making you nervous?
- Very nervous.
- Ha! Wonderful!
Once a month I try to make
pretty young girls nervous.
Just to keep my ego from going out.
But I'll save you a lot of anguish,
I'm si... I'm 58 years old
and a thoroughly nice fellow.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm not.
I wish I were 10 years older.
Older?
Yes, dirty old men
get away with a lot more.
You see,
I'm still at the awkward age.
Now, when do I get
invited down for dinner?
Dinner? We'd love to have you
to dinner as soon as we get set up.
I could starve to death.
Shall we say Tuesday night?
Tuesday night, no, my mother's...
- Tuesday night's fine.
- It's a date.
I'll bring wine,
pay me back when I get here.
And you're invited to my
cocktail party tomorrow, 10pm.
- You do drink?
- Of course.
- Good! Bring liquor.
- If we don't freeze first.
You don't know about
the plumbing, do you?
Everything in this museum
works backward.
For example,
on the steam it says "turn right"
so you turn left.
- Except I can't reach it.
- Will you help me up, please?
- With great physical pleasure.
One, two, three, up!
Corie, was there anybody...
We were just
warming up the apartment.
This is Mr Velasco from upstairs.
He was telling me
all our plumbing works backwards.
That's right. An important thing
to remember is you have to flush up.
- Until tomorrow.
- What's tomorrow?
Don't forget Tuesday!
Tuesday?
What's he doing in the bedroom?
That nut went out the window.
Hello?
Hello, Mother? It's me.
There's an old nut out on our ledge!
Nothing's wrong, I'm just confirming
our Tuesday night dinner date.
- At two in the morning?
- I wanna be sure you'll come.
At two in the morning?
And listen,
wear something gay and frivolous.
Buy a new dress.
At two in the morning?
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
- Who are you waving at?
- Him.
I decided to meet you here every day.
It takes so long to climb up
and I can't wait.
The bus driver will think
you're my mother.
Do you have an Aunt Fern?
She sent us a cheque today.
- Boy, do you have a cheap Aunt Fern.
- I'll write and tell her.
Your mother called, she and your
father are coming up a week Sunday.
And your sister has a new boyfriend.
From Rutgers, he has acne. And they
all hate him, including your sister.
- Did you miss me today?
- No.
- Why not?
- Because you called me eight times.
I don't talk to you
that much at home.
What a grouch.
How did it go in court?
- I...
- Gump or Birnbaum?
- Birnbaum.
- You won?!
Yes.
Oh, I'm so proud!
Aren't you happy?
Birnbaum didn't win damages.
- We got six cents.
- Six cents?
It's the law,
you have to get something.
- How much do you get?
- Birnbaum gets it all.
I get a going-over tomorrow.
Now I get all the cases
for a dime or under.
Grouch, grouch, grouch!
You weren't grouchy this morning
under the covers.
Don't carry on personal conversations
on the stairs.
Why, what's wrong with it?
Everybody knows our intimate details.
I ring the bell
and suddenly we're on the air.
I better make you a drink.
You should be charming tonight.
This little dinner you've planned
has got fiasco written all over it.
Why? It may be
they have a lot in common.
Are you kidding? Your mother...
That quiet woman from New Jersey
and the Count of Monte Cristo?
- You're kidding.
- Why?
You've seen his apartment, he wears
Japanese kimonos and sleeps on rugs.
Your mother wears a hairnet
and sleeps on a board.
Maybe we could help her.
We don't have to introduce her as
my dull 52-year-old housewife mother.
That wasn't what I planned
but what did you have in mind?
Something more glamorous.
Former actress.
She was in
"The Man Who Came To Dinner".
Where, the East Orange Women's Club?
No, Broadway. She was in the original
company of "Strange Interlude"
and she had a small part
in "Knickerbocker Holiday".
Are you serious?
Cross my heart.
- Your mother an actress?
- Yeah.
You never told me this.
Why didn't you ever tell me this?
I didn't think you'd be interested.
That's fascinating,
I can't get over that.
- Now you're interested.
- It's a lie.
- Every bit of it.
- I'll control myself.
- Hello, Mom.
- Are you all right?
Paul... in my handbag...
are some pink pills.
Pink pills? Right.
I'll be all right,
I'm just out of breath.
I'll get you something to drink.
I had to park three blocks away.
Then it started to rain
so I ran the last two blocks.
Then my heel got caught
in the subway grating.
Then I stepped in a puddle and a cab
went by and splashed my stockings.
If the hardware store was open I was
going to buy a knife and kill myself.
- Drink this.
- Here's the pill.
Martini to wash down a pill?
It'll make you feel better.
I had one at home,
that's why I'm taking the pill.
Let me help you inside.
- I'll get you an hors d'oeuvre.
- No, thank you.
- It's sour cream and blue cheese.
- I wish you hadn't said that.
- Maybe a lie down?
- No, thank you, dear.
I can't lie down without my board.
Right now, I just want
to see the apartment.
Well, here we are.
- Corie!
- Do you like it?
Like it?
It's magnificent.
My oodness!
And you did it all by yourself.
- Mr Velasco gave me a few ideas.
- Who?
Our decorator,
he comes in through the window.
The man from upstairs.
You've heard about him, eh?
Yes, Corie had me on the phone
for two hours.
He's been married four times.
If I were you I'd sleep with a gun.
Mother! See, we did get the bed in.
Yes. Just fits, doesn't it?
Just. We have to turn in unison.
Well, I must admit,
I never expected anything like this.
I can't wait to see the expression
on your parents' faces, Paul.
I beg your... My what?
We're having dinner with them,
aren't we?
- That's what you told me, Corie.
- Is that what you told her, Corie?
If I told you you had a blind date
with Mr Velasco you'd never come.
A blind date with Mr Velasco?
The man that lives up... Good God!
What's all the panic?
He's just a man.
My accountant is just a man. You make
him sound like Douglas Fairbanks.
- He looks nothing like him, does he?
- He jumps like him.
Come on, you'll have
a marvellous evening.
- Come on where?
- To Mr Velasco's.
- I'm not even dressed.
- You look fine.
For Paul's parents I wanted to look
clean - he'll think I'm a nurse.
- You're very interesting.
- Is my hair all right?
Fine, just push it up a bit.
Paul, is something wrong
with my hair?
Mother, just go along
with everything.
- Where are we going?
- Try to be one of the fellows.
- What fellows?
- Shall I go first?
- Go where?
- Up there.
- It's where the birdman lives.
- Good Lord.
Go on, Paul.
It's all right, Mother,
I'm behind you.
Mother, are you all right?!
Oh, my, I should
have gone into training!
Oh, Paul, pull her up!
- Give me your arm, Mom.
- Oh, my arm!
- Paul, stop pulling her arm!
- I'm helping.
Thank you! Ooh, isn't this wild?
What do you think, Mother?
- I've broken some straps.
- Hello?
Ah, my guests. Paul...
- I beg your pardon?
- "Hello" in Burmese.
- Corie, rav-a-shing!
- What's that mean?
Ravishing. That's English.
Paul, won't you do the honours?
Mr Velasco, you haven't met
Corie's mother, Mrs Banks.
- Mom, this is Mr Velasco.
- How do you do?
I was looking forward to meeting you.
At my cocktail party your daughter
talked of nothing but you.
- That must have been a dull party.
- Not at all.
I mean if she just talked about me,
not the party!
- I understand.
- Thank you.
Won't you sit down?
Aren't these marvellous?
Yes, they're marvellous.
And now...
Knichi!
It's an hors d'oeuvre. Mr Velasco
makes them, he's a famous gourmet.
- Imagine.
- He cooked for the King of Sweden.
We belonged to the same gourmet
society - 150 chartered members -
including Prince Philip,
Fidel Castro...
- Fidel Castro, too?
- Yes.
We meet every five years
for a dinner we cook ourselves.
In 1987 they're supposed
to come to my house.
We have another 30 seconds.
- Until what?
- Until they're edible.
The last 15 seconds we just let them
sit there and breathe.
- Paul, aren't they gorgeous!
- Yeah.
When you eat knichi
you take a bite into history.
Knichi is over 2,000 years old.
Not this batch, of course!
Are you allowed to tell us
what's in them?
Well, if caught, your taste buds
are ostracised for two years,
but since I'm among friends.
It's bits of salted fish, grated
olives, spices and onion batter.
Ready!
Five, four, three,
two, one, zero.
- Mrs Banks.
- Thank you.
- What kind of fish is it?
- Eel!
Eel?
That's why the time element
is so essential. Eel spoils quickly.
Mrs Banks, you're not eating.
I had a martini
and a pink pill and I...
Please, the temperature
of the knichi is very important.
You must eat now,
in five minutes we throw it away.
Wouldn't want you to do that.
- No, no, pop it.
- Pardon?
If you nibble knichi
it tastes bitter.
You must pop it. Look.
See?
Oh, thank you.
- Mother, are you all right?
- I popped it back too far.
- Was that water?
- No, vodka, I use it in the knichi.
My stomach...
The trick is to pop it
right to the centre of the tongue
so it gets the benefit
of the entire palate. Corie.
Well, here goes.
- How about that?
- Perfect!
You are the prettiest Epicurean
I've ever seen. Paul.
No, thank you. I have a bad arm.
You can try - you have to try
everything, right, Mr Velasco?
As the French say, at least once.
Bitter, right?
You know why, don't you?
- I nibbled, I didn't pop.
- Have another and...
I don't care to pop another. Besides,
we're over the five minute limit.
Are we ready to go out to dinner?
Aren't we having dinner at your flat?
- We had a fire in our stove.
- What happened?
We just turned it on.
If you're looking for the unusual,
I have a suggestion.
That's what we want, right, Mother?
You know me, one of the fellows.
- Then off to the Four Winds.
- The Chinese restaurant?
The Albanian restaurant on
Staten Island. We'll take the ferry.
- In February?!
- I love it already! Come on, Mother.
Paul, help her.
It won't let go of me!
Don't expect anything lavish
in the way of decor.
I'm not even certain
they have a restaurant licence!
Mr Velasco, don't you wear a coat?
It's only 30 degrees -
for me it's springtime!
My group, stick close -
if anyone gets lost,
we'll meet at the United States
embassy.
Where were you?
- Getting my gloves.
- What for? It's only 30 degrees.
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot -
we're having a heatwave!
- Do you have a dime?
- Yeah.
Would you look at her? Look at her.
She's freezing to death
but she wouldn't admit that.
I'll admit it. I'm freezing to death.
- Hi.
- Help!
Voilà!
Come on, Mother.
Listen, are you sure
we're in the right place?
What? Inhale... This way.
Heavenly!
"Em Shask Kepop" - "The Four Winds".
I bid you now,
enter a gastronomical paradise.
Kishama!
Velasco!
You taste delicious!
You think so?
I put myself on the menu!
- How many have you got?
- Four. All cold, tired and starving.
Good! First you drink, then you eat,
then go up to my bed
and take a little sleep!
Get up, get up!
Ahh! Ouzo, my beautiful beloved ouzo!
Paul, you drink?
Yes, thank you.
Ouzo, I'd like a Scotch...
No, this is ouzo. She is Mushka.
- Didn't you know this was ouzo?
- No.
- Is the glass dirty?
- What colour is ouzo?
- White.
- It's dirty.
To the beginning of new friendships!
- What does that mean?
- I don't know, I just made it up.
Cheers!
- Here's to your health, Mom.
- To my health.
Have another - quickly!
- Really...
- One can make you sick.
Two starts you
on the road to recovery.
- Pelmenchki!
- I don't believe it!
- Taste it, you still won't!
- Pelmenchki, for us!
He only makes it twice a year!
If you like it,
I make you more next July.
To Pelmenchki!
Pour it in right away
otherwise it goes sour.
It's Mushka!
- What are they playing?
- An old Albanian folk song.
- "Shama shama", what does that mean?
- Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
No kidding?
I'll race you up the stairs!
No, no, no!
No, you don't!
I won!
I won...
That was not a fair race.
You tickled me.
- How do you say it again?
- Say what?
Waiter, there's a fly in my soup.
Poopla, sirca al mercoori.
Sirca poopla al mercoori.
No, that's "Fly,
you have a waiter in my soup".
Well, I did - he put his hand in
to take out the fly!
Oh, how's my head
gonna feel tomorrow?
- Wonderful!
- No headache?
No! No headache! But you won't be
able to make a fist for three days.
Hey, look at that!
We promised to make coffee.
And a promise is a promise!
I forgot the stove doesn't work!
Upstairs for coffee.
- Don't you want coffee?
- They will if we make it.
Don't you two go away!
I feel like we've died.
And gone to heaven.
Only we had to climb up.
Struck down in the prime of life.
It isn't exactly that I feel sick,
just kind of numb.
And I can't make a fist.
Mom, you want to hear
something frightening?
My teeth feel soft.
It's funny, the best thing
we had all night was the knichi.
Anyway, Corie had a good time.
She gets such a terrific kick
out of living.
You've got to admire that,
don't you, Paul?
Yes, I'd admire anyone
who has three portions of Pelmenchki.
I tried, Paul, I just couldn't work
up an appetite the way they did.
No, don't blame yourself, Mom, we're
not used to that food, that's all.
You don't pick up a fork
and dig into a black salad.
You've gotta play with it!
I couldn't get through coffee
tonight. I'm all out of pink pills.
- Where you going?
- I'd like to die in my own bed.
- What will I tell them?
- Make up some clever little lie.
Tell Corie I'm not really her mother.
We've decided to have flaming brandy.
Excuse me, darling, but it is late.
- Mother, you can't go!
- I know, darling,
but I have a 10 o'clock dentist
appointment at nine o'clock,
and it's been a very long evening.
- You can't...
- Darling, good night, Paul.
Good night, Mr Velasco.
Good night, Paul.
- Good night, Corie.
- You're going too?
- I'm going to drive Mrs Banks home.
- Oh, no!
- I mean no, it's too late.
- For what?
The buses stop at two o'clock,
how would you get home?
I'll meet that problem in New Jersey.
Really, Mr Velasco...
- Victor.
- What?
If we're spending the evening
together it must be Victor,
and the arrangement
must be reciprocal. What is it?
- What is what?
- Your name, Mother.
It's Ethel.
Oh, yes, that's right,
my name is Ethel.
That's better.
Are you ready, Ethel?
If you insist, Walter.
Victor. It's Victor.
Good night, Paul.
Shama shama, Corie.
If you don't hear from us
try the Nacional Hotel, Mexico City,
room 703. Come on, Ethel!
- What did he mean?
- Stop worrying.
And call me in the morning.
How about that? He likes her.
He likes my mother.
He'll probably have to sleep over.
Paul, do you suppose that...?
Not my mother.
Boy, what a night.
I know,
let's take the Scotch downstairs
ring the bells and yell "Police"
just to see
who comes out of whose apartment.
Don't you feel well, darling?
What a rotten thing to do -
your own mother.
Why?
Dragging her out to the harbour
for a bowl of sheep-dip.
It was Greek bean soup.
And at least she tasted it.
She didn't jab it with her knife,
throwing cute epigrams
like "Ho, ho,
I think somebody's in there".
That's quite a match you made, I can
just hear the sparkling dialogue.
He's talking about
a Japanese restaurant in East Berlin
and she's describing
her root canal job.
- Give me your hand, Ethel.
- What?
- There is ice on the stoop.
- Don't worry about me. I can manage.
Ethel, are you all right?
I can't understand how you can be
so unconcerned about this.
Unconcerned?!
Do you think I'll get any sleep
until that phone rings tomorrow?
I'm scared to death for my mother.
And I'm grateful there's finally
something to be scared about.
What I'm really concerned about
is you.
Me? Me?!
I'm wondering if you're capable
of having a good time.
Why, because I wear gloves in winter?
No.
Because there isn't
the least bit of adventure in you.
You know what you are?
You're a watcher. A watcher.
There are watchers
and there are doers,
and the watchers watch the doers do.
Well, tonight you watched and I did.
It was harder to watch what you did
than to do what I was watching.
You can't even relax for one evening.
- Sometimes you act like a...
- What? A stuffed shirt?
- Is that it?
- I didn't say that.
- That's what you implied.
- No, that's what you anticipated.
But you're very proper and dignified.
When was I proper and dignified?
- At Delfino's you were drunk?
- I was stoned.
I didn't even know
until you told me in the morning.
I mean,
you're a funny kind of drunk.
You sat around looking unhappy,
watching your coat.
Because I saw someone else
watching my coat.
I'll get drunk
and make your hair stand on end.
That isn't necessary!
Last New Year's Eve
I punched an old woman.
Don't tell me about drunk.
When else was I proper and dignified?
All the time. You're always
dressed right, you always look right.
You always say the right thing.
You're very nearly perfect.
- That's a rotten thing to say.
- I thought you slept with a tie.
Only for very formal sleeps.
You have no sense of the ridiculous.
Thursday you wouldn't walk barefoot
in Washington Square Park. Why?
- It was 17 degrees.
- Exactly.
It's very logical and sensible
and it's no fun.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am too proper and dignified.
Maybe you'd have been happier
with somebody more flamboyant
like the geek.
More laughs than a stuffed shirt.
- You said I wasn't.
- Well, you are now.
I'm not gonna listen to this.
I'm in court this morning.
- Where are you going?
- To sleep.
- How can you go to sleep now?
- Good night, dear.
You cannot, we're having a fight!
You have it,
and then turn off these lights.
That gets me insane!
You can even control your emotions!
No, I'm just as upset as you,
but when I'm hungry I eat,
when I'm tired I sleep,
and you eat and sleep too.
Not during a crisis!
Crisis? We're just yelling.
This isn't a crisis? Our marriage
is hanging in the balance.
It is? When did this happen?
It has suddenly become very clear
to me that we have nothing in common.
Because I won't walk barefoot
in the park? You don't have a case.
Don't oversimplify this.
I'm angry, can't you see?
It's 2.15.
If I can get to sleep
I'll get five hours' sleep.
I'll call tomorrow
to fight on the phone, OK?
You will not sleep! Stay here
and fight to save our marriage!
If our marriage hinges on Pelmenchki
it's not worth saving.
Now, dear, I'm crawling into our tiny
single bed if you'd care to join me.
You won't discuss it!
You're afraid to discuss it! Coward!
Bring a pail,
the closet's dripping.
I hate you!
I really really hate you!
One thing I've learned in court -
when you're tired and angry
you may say something you'll regret.
- I'm tired and angry.
- And a coward!
Maybe you're right, maybe we
don't have anything in common.
Maybe we should have
more than just a blood test.
Maybe people should be checked for
common sense and emotional maturity!
All right! Why don't you
get it passed by the Supreme Court?!
Only couples with a certificate
proving that they're
emotionally mature can be married!
- Oh, listen...
- Don't touch me!
Don't you lay a finger on me!
I don't want to be
in the same room with you!
- What's going on? You're hysterical.
- I am not!
I know exactly what I'm saying -
it's over between us.
It's never going to be any good.
Sorry, I don't want to cry.
- Cry, please, go ahead.
- Don't tell me when to cry!
I'll cry when I feel like crying!
And not until
you're out of this apartment!
What do you mean,
"out of this apartment"?
You don't think we're gonna
live here any more?! After this?!
- Are you serious?
- Of course I am! I want a divorce!
- Divorce?!
- I can't discuss it any more.
- Where are you going?
- To bed.
- You can't.
- You did.
That was a fight, this is a divorce.
I can't talk when you're hysterical.
I wanna know why you want a divorce.
Why?
Because you and I have
absolutely nothing in common.
Nothing in common? What about
the six days at the Plaza?
Six days does not a week make.
What does that mean?
I don't know!
I don't know what it means.
All I know is
that I want a divorce.
You know, I think you mean it.
You mean this?
I do.
I really do.
That's just... great.
- I thought you weren't gonna cry?
- Well, I am!
I'm gonna have the biggest cry
I ever had in my whole life!
And I'm going to enjoy it!
Cos I'm gonna cry so hard
I'm gonna keep you awake all night!
Good night, Paul... I mean goodbye.
Six days does not a week make?
It's for you!
I don't live here any more!
Fine.
You work and work, for a lousy
six cents, I don't know...
- One pound of grapes. Anything else?
- No, thank you.
God bless him.
If that's for tonight don't bother,
I have my own.
- You were moving out.
- I haven't found a room yet.
I work during the day.
You can look tonight.
I'm getting a cold.
That's why I'm home early.
I thought I'd take some aspirin
and get into the sofa.
I'm sure you can find someplace.
- Stay at your club.
- It's not that kind of club.
There's a locker room
and a handball court.
To sleep over
I'd have to keep winning the serve.
Hello, Mrs Bratter, Mr Bratter.
How's every little thing?
The little things are fine.
Shall I charge it, Mr Bratter?
Charge it to Mrs Bratter -
a new account.
The grapes are his.
It's open.
- Hi.
- Hello again.
Phone's out of order.
I know, I wouldn't be up here
on a social call.
Hey, you did a real nice job.
Know anybody who'd want to rent it?
Rent it? Are you moving already?
I'm looking for a smaller place.
Smaller than this
are not easy to find.
So, how do you like married life?
Very interesting.
- Hello, I'm the telephone man.
- I'm the husband.
Well, let's see
what's wrong with the phone.
It's dead.
I know. It was murdered last night.
I'll be out of here as fast as I can.
Take your time, nobody's rushing you.
Is there any beer in the house?
I said,
is there any beer in the house?
Would you like me to look?
There's no beer in the house.
There is no beer.
That's my trouble, beer. I can drink
ten cans in a night... of beer.
My laundry come back today?
Yes, your laundry came back today.
They stuffed your shirts beautifully.
Would you like a drink?
I said, would you like a drink?!
- Who?
- You.
- Me?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Right.
Just one more little screw
will do it.
There!
I'm finished. I'm finished!
Hello?
Yes, it is.
Just a moment.
It's Aunt Harriet.
I don't have an Aunt Harriet.
You won't
be needing me any more, goodbye!
Aunt Harriet?
Can you hang on a second?
When do I get it?
- Get what?
- My divorce. When do I get it?
After they send the marriage licence.
- I want you out of here tonight.
- Fine, great! I'll get my bag!
Hi, Aunt Harriet.
What's wrong?
I'll sleep in the car
where it's dry and warm.
No, Mother's not with me.
She left about two this morning.
Yeah? What happened?
What?!
Mother?! My mother?!
- Are you sure?
- What's the matter?
No, my phone's been out of order.
Aunt Harriet, don't get excited,
I'll call you back when I find out.
- Goodbye.
- What's wrong?
They didn't come home last night.
I'm gonna call the police.
Take it easy,
there's nothing to be...
Mother wasn't in her room
this morning.
Maybe she fell asleep
on the ironing board.
Just go away - go away.
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs to find my mother.
And don't come back,
I'm buying a big dog tomorrow.
Fine, someone to walk
barefoot in the park with.
A dog, that's a laugh.
He'll take one look at those stairs
and go right for her throat.
Mr Velasco, can I see you
for a minute?!
A little dog, a little doggie.
Fortunately I don't need anybody
to protect me because I'm a man.
Independent.
Mature.
Self-sufficient...
Oh, God bless me.
I've probably got the 'flu.
Yeah. Chills, fever, sweating.
Probably have a 24-hour virus.
Maybe tomorrow at...
quarter to four.
Thanks, thanks a lot.
And thus it was written, some shall
die by pestilence, some by the plague
and one poor schnook gets it
from a hole in the ceiling.
That's it. That's it.
Goodbye, leaky closet.
Goodbye, no bathtub.
Bye, hole.
Goodbye, six flights.
Goodbye, Corie.
- No goodbye? I'm entitled to...
- Goodbye!
Is it your mother?
Corie? Is it an accident?
Corie, for Pete's sake...
It's not the way it looks at all!
Good God...
Corie, you've got to believe me!
Somebody believe me...
I warned her.
I warned her and I was right.
He warned me...
and he was right.
It must've been the drinks,
I had a lot to drink last night.
Martinis, vodka,
black bean soup and ouzos.
Well, it's not my problem.
I'm well out of it now.
And after I fell,
Victor carried me inside.
I couldn't walk
because my shoes fell down the sewer.
Don't explain.
His hat fell over his eyes
and we fell down the stairs...
into apartment 3C.
I fell on his foot.
I wanted
a nice sociable evening.
Mr Gonzales, Mr Armendariz and
Mr Calhoun carried us both up there.
When I woke up Victor was gone
and I was there in his bathrobe.
- Oh, Mother!
- That's the truth, Corie!
- I got a cold.
- I've had one for 20 years.
Say, that's a nice coat
you got there.
What? Huh?
Your coat.
I'll make you a trade,
what have you got?
Nothin'.
It's a deal!
Believe me,
I've told you everything.
- Then where are your clothes?
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?
- You won't believe me.
- I will.
- You won't.
- Where are your clothes?
- I don't know.
- I don't believe you.
- I told you.
I don't know where they are!
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life.
I kept having
the most horrible nightmares.
I dreamt my fingers were falling off
because I couldn't make a fist.
It's me!
Mr Velasco, are you all right?
If a broken toe is all right, yes.
Hello, Ethel.
- Victor... Mr Victor... Velasco.
- I couldn't get up the ladder.
- Did you tell Corie what happened?
- Why? What happened? Ooh, yes.
Take his arm, Mother.
I knew I would come to this,
being helped by women.
Dear, does your foot hurt?
Compared to my stomach, no.
I have a new ailment, which
I shall call Intestinal Volcano.
Are there little men in there
running around in spiked shoes?
And pointy steel helmets,
jumping up and down.
How long has this been going on?
It hardly ever happens,
except after every meal.
Welcome to my club.
I think you have an ulcer.
An ulcer, me? From what?
Too many spicy foods. You'll get used
to taking little pink pills.
I'd rather die,
but first I have a headache.
Corie, do you have
about 300 aspirins?
I don't think I'm as young
as I think I am.
- Why?
- Isn't that obvious?
I couldn't carry you up the stairs,
I can't eat rich food
and I dye my hair, my...
- It's very nice.
- Thank you.
So are you.
- Ethel, you're a very unusual woman.
- Unusual? In what way?
I took a long look at you last night,
you know what you are?
- A good sport.
- Oh. A good sport.
All through last night,
the trip to Staten Island,
the strange food,
being carried up to my apartment.
If you remember, eh?
Mr Velasco, where are my clothes?
Your clothes. Here.
I'm sure I wore more than that.
It's a cleaning ticket.
They're sending them up.
At the cleaners!
When did I take them off?
You didn't, you were drenched
and out cold. Gonzales took them off.
- Mr Gonzales?
- Not Mr, Dr Gonzales.
Oh, Dr Gonzales. That's all right.
How convenient, having an MD here.
Not an MD,
a Doctor of Philosophy.
Here are your aspirin.
- No, I'm feeling much better now.
- I'll take them.
Well, I must go, someone is calling
about renting my apartment.
From now on I take elevators.
Is there anything
I can do for you?
Yes, there is. Would you
have dinner with me tonight?
- Me?
- If you don't mind plain food.
I love plain food.
I'll call New York Hospital
for a reservation.
- I'll pick you up at seven.
- Whatever you say, Victor.
That's funny,
I was getting used to Walter.
You know what I could use right now?
A double ouzo.
What I really could use
is a new outfit.
- Mother, can I talk to you?
- I slept without a board last night.
For the first time in years
I slept without a board.
- Mother...
- Is ouzo a Greek miracle drug?
Mother, I've got to talk to you.
- You're worried about me.
- I'm not worried about you.
My hair, I wonder
what I could do with my hair.
Paul and I are getting a divorce.
Divorce?
That's right.
Paul and I are splitting up.
For good.
You and Paul? I don't believe you.
You saw him leave with his suitcase,
what did you think he had in there?
I know how neat he is,
I thought maybe the garbage.
Mother, I believe you,
why don't you believe me?
Because I've never seen two people
more in love than you and Paul.
Maybe that was true yesterday...
but it sure isn't true today.
It couldn't have been all your fault.
No? Because of me you were running
around without your clothes and...
Paul is out on the streets with
a cold looking for a place to sleep.
Whose fault is that?
Yours.
You want to know something
that may shock you?
I still love you.
And Paul loves you too.
And I love him.
I don't know what he wants.
I don't know how to make him happy.
What am I gonna do, Mother?
That's the first time you've asked
my advice since you were ten.
It's really very simple.
All you have to do is give up
a little bit of you for him.
Don't make everything a game,
just late at night in that little
room upstairs, take care of him.
Make him feel... important.
If you can do that you'll have
a happy and wonderful marriage.
Like two out of every ten couples.
You'll be one of the two, baby.
Now, get out of here
and go find him.
I've got a date.
Aunt Harriet won't believe
a word of this.
If you don't hear from me
try the Nacional Hotel, Mexico City,
room 703.
It is you!
I doubt that very much.
- I've been looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, you'll never find me!
Your coat! Where's your coat?
Coat?
I don't need a coat.
It's only two degrees.
What have you been doing?
What have I been doing?
Just what have I been doing?
I've been walking
barefoot in the park.
Paul, you're crazy.
But guess what I am?
You're drunk?
You finally noticed!
You're lousy stinking drunk.
Oh! I see you still have your shoes!
Boy, what a stuffed shirt!
Paul, no!
Paul, are you all right?
Corie,
I got to tell you something.
- Later.
- No, now.
I got all the way down the stairs
and suddenly it hit me.
Suddenly, I saw everything clearly
for the first time.
I said to myself,
this is crazy... this is crazy.
It's all wrong
for me to run away like this.
There's only
one right thing to do.
Really, Paul? What?
You get out!
Why should I get out?
Lease is in my name.
I'm going home!
Drop in any time!
You know my address!
After all,
a man's home is his castle.
I'm home, castle!
Oh, oh, still here?
Well... I will... I will give you
ten minutes...
to pack up your Pelmenchki... and go.
You're burning up with a fever!
- How about that?
- You'll get pneumonia.
That's what you want,
that's what I'll get.
Take your shoes off,
they're soaking.
I can't, my feet have swellen.
- I shouldn't have let you out.
- I've got an idea.
Let's do
what you said before,
wake the police, see if they
come out of the crazy neighbours.
This building is under arrest!
Everybody out!
Paul, will you get into bed?
- You first.
- You're sick.
Not that sick.
No, stop it. Stop it!
I mean it, stop it.
- Come here, cutie.
- Paul, stop it.
No!
You're pretty
when you're mean and rotten.
Keep away from me
or I'll scream!
There's snow,
we'll have an avalanche.
You've got a fever!
Stand still, the both of you!
Open this door!
I'm scared!
- Of me?
- Yes.
- Why?
- It's not you any more.
I want the old Paul back.
- Oh, that fuddy-duddy?
- He's not a fuddy-duddy.
He's strong and dependable and
protects me from people like you!
I want him to know I love him,
and I'll make everything
how he wants it.
The hole in the skylight
and the leak in the closet...
I'll put in a bathtub,
and even carry him upstairs at night,
that's how much I love him!
You idiot, you'll kill yourself!
Come down!
No! I wanna be a nut!
Just like everybody else
in this building!
No, Paul, I don't want you
to be a nut. Come down, please!
Not until you have said it again.
- Loud and clear.
- Anything, Paul, anything.
- My husband...
- My husband...
- Paul Bratter...
- Paul Bratter...
Rising young attorney...
Rising young...
rising young attorney!
- Is a lousy, stinking drunk!
- Is a lousy, stinking drunk.
And I love him!
I love you too, Corie.
Even when I didn't like you
I loved you.
Then, Paul, please, come down!
- I can't, not now.
- Why?
Cos I'm gonna be sick.
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes.
Don't move,
I'll be right out there to get you.
Would you do that?
Cos I'm getting panicky.
Paul, I'm coming, I'm coming.
What? What, Paul?
Don't leave me.
Paul, you'll be all right.
Just hold on tight and be calm.
How? What should I do?
What should he do?
What should he do?
- Sing!
- Sing?
Sing as loud as you can
and don't stop till I get there.
- Promise you'll sing?
- I promise.
OK, don't stop. I love you, darling!
Keep singing, Paul!
- Corie!
- What, Paul?
What song should I sing?
"Shama Shama".
- Shama?
- Sing it!
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
They're looking at this house.
Oh, good, they made up.
