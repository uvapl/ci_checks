  [ Pippi And Crew ]
    Life is a breeze
We live it for fun
No apologies
 to anyone
<i>We live on the seas</i>
<i>  We do as we please </i>
   [ Whinnies To Beat ]
[ Chittering ]
From stem to stern
 each moment is now
Life without concern
 from aft until bow
We live on the seas
  We do as we please
Papa
Aye, aye, Pippi!
Why do we want all these
necklaces and stuff?
Gifts for the
Kurrekurre islanders,
of course.
And I suppose these
are to buy me a dress
fit for a queen!
[ Laughing ]
There you're wrong,
me little darlin'.
They're to keep you
out of the pot.
Little girl stew is a delicacy
if they're still cannibals
like the good old days.
Papa... save me!
[ Laughing ]
I'll show you!
<i>Right! Onto Alfonso!</i>
No! Hey!
Are we gonna take Alfonso
ashore, Papa?
Of course.
Aren't I the "Terror
of the South Seas"?
We'll ride ashore in style.
Maybe they'll think
I'm King Neptune.
King Neptune?
Never heard of him.
    It's time you went back
    to school.
Oh!
                Fridolf.
Yes, sir?
Take five
and learn the princess
some history stuff...
that'll come in handy
when she's a boss like me.
Count on me, sir.
All right, Pippi, history.
Take notes.
Okay, Mr. Neilson, if I have
to learn this rotten old
history stuff, so do you.
<i>All right,</i>
in the beginning,
there were... apples,
oranges... and bananas!
[ Together ]
And Mr. Neilson
loves bananas!
[ Chittering ]
Into the rigging,
and down with the mainsail!
It's plain as Pippi's nose,
there's foul weather ahead!
<i>[ Thunderclap ]</i>
Sorry, Fridolf, I can't
study anymore. They need me
in the crow's nest.
- [ Blowing Conch Shell,
    Shouting ]
- [ Chittering ]
- Help! Papa!
- What is it, Pippi?
A big wave...
coming towards the ship!
- Come down now!
- No way n!
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>Help!</i>
    Take over, Fridolf.
    I've got to get Pippi down.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Papa, I'm scared!
Lash yourself
to the mast, girl!
I'm comin' up for ya!
[ Papa ]
Hang on!
Papa, I'm slipping!
Hang on!
If I lose you,
remember the Villa Villekulla.
<i>The Gulf Stream</i>
<i>will take you there.</i>
We'll come out on top
like we always do.
[ Screaming ]
Help!
[ Screams ]
Papa!
 Papa, where are you?
I'm drifting away
toward the island.
The current's taking me.
Papa, it's taking me
the other way.
<i>[ Papa ]</i>
<i>Grab hold of the raft.</i>
Make for
the Villa Villekulla.
Papa! Papa!
<i>[ Papa's Voice ]</i>
<i>I'll find you somehow.</i>
<i>I love ya, Pippi.</i>
I wish some kids
lived there.
It would be fun
to have best friends
living right next door.
Hello.
You kids live here?
No. We live in that house
over there.
        The nice white one.
Well, who lives in this dump?
    Nobody. It's been empty
    practically forever.
What did I tell ya?
Absentee ownership.
Probably dead.
We'll pull it down
and the whole plot'll develop.
You can't do that!
We play in that tree
over there sometimes.
Not anymore you don't!
Come on. Take pictures of it.
Lot of pictures.
I'll knock it down, and we pour
cement as far as you can see.
Everything living gets cut down.
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>It's another gold mine, boss!</i>
We're drifting
in the right direction,
and we're not gonna starve.
[ Chitters ]
Keep reeling 'em in,
Mr. Neilson.
Mr. Neilson and I
are very grateful to you
for saving us.
[ Yawns ]
    But you've got to eat.
[ Mumbling ]
        That's all there is!
Mmm, not bad.
- Blahhh!
- [ Burps, Laughs ]
Well done, Mr. Neilson.
You might not be the prettiest
monkey at sea, but you're
the cleverest and thdearest.
- What about me?
- Okay, okay,
  I love you too.
And now we must stick together,
like the time
when we were in Timbuktu.
So when Papa
finds his way back,
he'll say, "Well done, guys."
<i>[ Mr. Neilson Chittering ]</i>
Wake up, Mr. Neilson.
Another lovely day.
I hope Papa made it.
Don't worry, Alfonso,
the Gulf Stream will take us
home, just like Papa said.
<i>[ Boy ] But, Dad,</i>
<i>why would anyone wanna</i>
<i>tear down Villa Villekulla?</i>
Progress, Tommy.
Mr. Blackhart has plans...
to build all sorts of houses
and a golf course
and a swimming pool.
    Sounds nice.
    Maybe we should move.
[ Children ] No!
            I don't wanna move!
And what about
our tree?
Aah. There's plenty
of other trees, Tommy.
You and I'll go out
and find another one together.
Besides, this town
could use some changes.
Now, it's getting late.
[ Children Groan ]
Oh, come on.
Time to bed.
Come on. Off you go.
    Couple more minutes?
                Five minutes.
Nope, lights out
in half an hour.
           How 'bout an hour?
<i>No. Sorry.</i>
Time for bed.
Time for bed.
Now, you know where we are
if you need us, right?
Yes, good night.
You'll be all right?
                Yeah.
        Love you.
[ Children ] Love you.
Mom says the Villa
is over a hundred years old.
         <i>They can't tear it down</i>
         <i>just like that.</i>
Just won't be the same anymore.
<i>I don't wanna leave here...</i>
<i>ever.</i>
<i>[ Tommy ] You know, Annika,</i>
<i>there's something strange</i>
<i>going on in there.</i>
<i>[ Annika ]</i>
<i>You mean somebody's</i>
<i>in there?</i>
Or maybe even... ghosts?
<i>[ Tommy ]</i>
<i>Yeah! Could be even a ghost.</i>
<i>Let's go check it out.</i>
See anything?
    No.
Besides,
you can't see ghosts.
Well,
if you can't see ghosts,
         <i>[ Door Slams ]</i>
        then what
        are we looking for?
Shh!
<i>[ Creaking Noise ]</i>
               What was that?
The step creaked.
        Don't follow so close.
[ Screaming ]
[ Tommy ] Look.
It's up there.
If I say run, run!
Okay. Where?
Just run.
Look. Do ghosts
have big shoes?
Give me the bat.
Can you hit a ghost?
            Shh. Stop asking
            so many questions.
You see?
It's nothing.
Probably just--
- [ Whinnies ]
- [ Screaming ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Mr. Neilson Screeching ]
           [ Screaming ]
<i>[ Screeching ]</i>
Hi.
Who are you?
       You're not a ghost?
<i>'Course not.</i>
The ghosts live up in the attic.
     <i>[ Tommy ]</i>
     <i>We know. We just saw one.</i>
It was big and white
and had spots all over it.
<i>That's my horse, Alfonso.</i>
What's a horse doing
in the attic?
Beats me. I keep telling him
not to go up there,
but he doesn't listen.
Alfonso,
get down on the porch,
where you belong.
[ Whinnying ]
No way!
You see?
He won't listen.
My name's Pippi.
Pippi Longstocking.
I'm Tommy, and this
is my sister Annika.
What are you doing here?
I live here, of course.
    Are you gonna stay here
    all by yourself?
I'm not all by myself.
Mr. Neilson and Alfonso
live with me too.
[ Chittering ]
     <i>[ Annika ] Oh, is</i>
     <i>Mr. Neilson your father?</i>
    This is Mr. Neilson.
[ Chittering ]
My father is a sea captain
who was washed overboard
in a storm.
        Did he drown?
Of course not.
He lives
on the Kurrekurre Island.
He's the king of the cannibals.
Cannibals?
Real cannibals?
       There's no such thing
       today.
<i>[ Pippi ] How do you know?</i>
You've never been there,
have you?
And do they really...
eat you?
Yeah.
Which reminds me.
I'm hungry.
You guys hungry?
           We're always hungry.
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>Great.</i>
<i>[ Children Singing,</i>
<i>  Laughing ]</i>
What the heck's that ruckus
over there?
What could it be?
        You don't suppose
        Tommy and Annika--
No, I'll go see.
[ Singing, Laughing ]
Hey, Pippi!
Hey, Annika!
<i>Pancakes, Alfonso?</i>
[ Singing ]
[ Whinnying ]
Pancakes.
Something new.
[ Continue Singing ]
<i>[ Laughter ]</i>
<i>Tommy!</i>
<i>Annika!</i>
Just what in blazes
do you think you're doing?
We're just having
a midnight snack.
 <i>Care to join us?</i>
I have never seen
such a mess in my entire life!
You two are going to march
right home this very instant...
and go to bed!
And as for you, I don't know
who you think you are or what
you think you're doing here,
but I'm going to get
to the bottom of this
first thing in the morning.
March!
[ Chittering ]
Nice meeting you.
Aah!
[ Chittering ]
Thank goodness
I only have you and Alfonso
to worry about.
Alfonso?
[ Tommy ] Her name
is Pippi Longstocking.
    And she's come to live here.
I don't know what got
into you two. How could you
do something like this?
Here, darling.
Oh, thank you.
I'm-I'm so confused.
That house stands empty
for heaven knows how many years.
Suddenly in
the middle of the night, some
11-year-old terror moves in.
I know.
Our kids seem
to love it.
You should've seen them.
Uh, uh, a flying horse.
<i>How do we even know that</i>
<i>it's her father's house?</i>
<i>You can be sure</i>
<i>I'm going to get</i>
<i>to the bottom of this.</i>
<i>[ Alfonso ] I'm tired.</i>
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>Keep your head still, Alfonso.</i>
Hi. We're running
a little late this morning.
Oh, those are for you,
Annika and Tommy.
         <i>Thanks. A real sword.</i>
Did you wash
behind your ears?
            [ Mumbles ]
You can't expect a horse
to do for himself.
Shh. He thinks
he's just like us.
Okay, you can go out
and play now.
<i>But don't tease Mr. Neilson,</i>
<i>or you'll have to come</i>
<i>right back in.</i>
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Next on the list.</i>
<i>Ahh, nothing</i>
<i>like a morning bath.</i>
But, Pippi, you've got
all your clothes on!
That's because
it's laundry day.
Well, that's enough of that.
There is such a thing
as being too clean.
<i>You'll catch your death of cold</i>
<i>if you stand around like that.</i>
Since when do people die
from being wet?
That's what my mom
always says.
Well, now that
you mention it,
I do remember one time
at the North Pole
when I was so frozen...
after swimming with some seals
and some Eskimo kids that I had
to dry myself off like this.
See?
That was easy.
Now we're ready for a game.
Game of what?
Rub-a-dub-dub scrubbing day.
It's my favorite day.
Everything's soapy,
so we might as well
scrub the floor.
Scrub the floor?
<i>That's not a game.</i>
           You wanna bet?
<i>Oh, Pippi, what a mess!</i>
Here, put these on
and follow me.
[ Pippi And Chorus ]
 I put my
  scrubbing shoes on
And I never get the blues
 on Monday morning
Yeah, yeah
This dust'll be a goner
As I hit each dirty corner
 without warning
Yeah, yeah
Throwing soapsuds everywhere
 We're being careful
 very careful
To enjoy ourselves
 each step of the way
Scrubbing day
 is a holiday
And the game we play
 is as wild as it can get
Scrubbing day
 is my favorite day
'Cause on scrubbing day
 we make everything get wet
The greater the confusion
 I have come to the conclusion
 things get cleaner
Oh, yeah
The white is whiter
 Red is redder
 Blue is bluer
And the green
 gets greener
Yeah, yeah
Throwing water everywhere
 There is a feeling
 in the air
That any minute
 we could all float away
Everybody
 Scrubbing day
 is a holiday
And the game we play
 is as wild as it can get
Scrubbing day
 is my favorite day
'Cause on scrubbing day
 we make everything get wet
Whoa! It was lucky
I was here to catch you!
<i>[ Mother ]</i>
<i>What a great way</i>
<i>to clean up.</i>
I must try it someday.
This is my mom, Pippi.
Nice mom. My mom is--
She's not here right now.
She's, uh--
<i>I don't mean to be rude, Pippi,</i>
<i>but we're terribly late.</i>
<i>They've got to go</i>
<i>to the dentist.</i>
           Bye, Pippi.
<i>Bye, Pippi.</i>
<i>Wait! Here. Take these.</i>
My father got them
off of an old sailor
who didn't need them anymore.
I don't think
we can use them just now.
But do come and visit.
 <i>That'll be fun.</i>
Bye, Pippi.
                Bye, Pippi.
And when was
your last checkup?
Get back!
<i>Watch your step, boss.</i>
Briefcase.
<i>Good morning!</i>
Nice of you to call.
I'm Pippilotta Delicatessa
Windowshade Longstocking,
daughter of
Captain Efraim Longstocking.
            Pippi for short.
Pippi.
Good morning.
What can I do for you?
Selling vacuums?
I'll take a dozen.
                Wrap them up.
No, I'm not selling.
I'm buying. Oh, this is me.
Dan Blackhart.
Blackhart's Ideal Homes.
If you need it, we've got it.
Well, to be very honest
with you, I don't think
I need anything this morning.
[ Laughing ]
            But,
you can have this wonderfully
spectacular sewing machine
for a dollar.
I don't want your filthy
sewing machine.
I would like to look inside.
Will there be
anything else?
Oh! I wonder
if you'd be interested
in selling this house?
My home?
Selling?
[ Laughing ]
How can you sell a home?
You can't wrap it up.
You can't carry it away.
And you certainly can't
fit it in your car.
Obviously you can't
make much of a living...
if you're trying
to buy houses
other people are living in.
Here's a gold coin
for your troubles.
        Where did you get that?
No big deal.
I have a whole mess of them
down in the basement.
I just help myself
whenever I need to.
        How did they get there?
It's a long story.
But I can tell you this much.
It's part of the treasure
from King Solomon's mines.
I'm afraid
you'll have to go now.
It's Friday. Wash day.
[ Yelling ]
I'm sure
you'll understand.
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>
[ Laughing ]
Who is that girl?
What is she doing on a horse?
[ Pippi And Chorus ]
 Watch out, world
  'cause here she comes
<i>And she's bound to teach you</i>
<i> more than one thing </i>
Pippi Longstocking is coming
 into your town
      What is going on here?
<i>The one</i>
<i> no one can keep down </i>
No, no, no, no
Get them in the bus.
Get in there.
In the bus.
Get in the bus. Get
in the bus. Get in the bus.
That's no way to treat kids.
Is that where you go to school?
No. That's the home for
children who have no parents.
Nobody wants them.
Well, all kids
should be wanted and loved.
Maybe their moms and dads
just lost them.
Whoa, whoa
Pippi Longstocking is coming
 into your world
A freckled-faced
 red-haired girl
<i>You ought to know</i>
<i>she'll throw your life</i>
<i>into a whirl </i>
Everybody out.
Unhitch the horse,
my man.
    What are we going
    to buy today, Pippi?
A grand piano.
They don't sell pianos
in there.
            They might today.
Can you play the piano?
            How do I know
            until I've tried?
To play the piano
without a piano takes a lot
of practice, I can tell you.
But how are we gonna pay?
Spanish gold.
Pirates' money.
Pippi says you can find
your own way home.
                [ Nickers ]
            Do you want to go
            with him?
No, not me. Uh-uh, no way.
[ Chattering ]
He really is going home.
They missed
a good sale there.
Hi, freckle-face.
Don't you just love
freckles?
Not much!
            Well, I do.
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>What's going on over there?</i>
Children's home kids.
Come for their haircut
and teeth pulling.
Don't they ever have any fun
when they come to town?
Let's go play with them.
What's wrong?
Orphans.
            Dad says
            we shouldn't.
Why not?
They're just kids like us.
Let's go.
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>Quick, quick, quick.</i>
<i>Come along.</i>
        Next two, please.
Come on. You two next.
Hi! What flavor ice cream
do you like best?
[ Shouting ]
Chocolate! Vanilla!
Shh!
Back off!
It's against the rules.
Listen, I want you to go
to the ice cream truck
and get lots of ice cream...
and every kind of candy
that they have.
    Here's some gold coins.
    Okay. Now, go.
Come on, Annika.
You won't get away
with this.
I'm telling Miss Bannister,
and she'll soon
settle your hash.
Miss Bannister?
That settles it.
Now we're gonna have a ball.
<i>[ Girl ]</i>
<i>Miss Bannister?</i>
<i>There's this girl.</i>
She's creating havoc.
There's this girl. She--
She went up there.
I don't see anyone.
You silly, stupid girl.
Now, you mean you want
64 ice cream cones?
And Nestle's Crunch.
 And bubble gum.
And can we have
265 Oh Henry! bars?
[ Laughing ]
You just help yourselves.
It's all yours!
<i>Come on, kids!</i>
<i>It's Pippi Longstocking Day!</i>
[ Drumbeats,
    Accordion ]
The ice cream!
Let's get the ice cream.
That's really something, eh?
Those poor kids
never had such a treat.
[ Man ]
Here comes the ice cream.
Come on, kids!
 Come and get it!
[ Excited Shouting ]
Free ice cream!
[ Excited Shouting ]
There's always been a lot
of talk about Villa Villekulla
being an old pirate hangout.
   But I--
<i>[ Children Shouting ]</i>
I never heard anything
about a buried treasure inside.
There must be records.
Deeds? A bill of sale?
Anything!
Look, I want that place.
And I'm willing to pay
any legal costs to get it,
if you know what I mean.
[ Shouting ]
- Ohhh!
- [ Laughing ] Tommy,
  throw some more. Hurry!
    [ Gasps ]
    Well, go and get 'em!
Yes, Miss Bannister.
Tommy!
I think 've done
enough shopping for today.
I'll be right back.
<i>[ Child ]</i>
<i>Hey, get some more pistachio,</i>
<i>strawberry!</i>
Keep your eyes peeled.
Annika! Tom--
You... dirty rat!
- Okay, Mr. Neilson,
  time to do your stuff.
- Here we go. Here we go.
        [ Whistle Blows ]
You do something!
Arrest somebody!
Yes, ma'am.
[ Whistle Blows ]
Annika!
Tommy!
Eh, watch it!
Tommy!
Would you get out
of my-- Get--
<i>Tommy!</i>
[ Mr. Neilson
  Chittering ]
        All aboard!
Come on, Annika.
Go! Come on!
[ Car Horn Honking ]
- <i>Tommy, Annika,</i>
 <i>come down this minute!</i>
- Hold on!
No, no! Stay up!
- Bye, Dad!
  See you at dinner!
- You'll pay for this!
I know who's responsible
for this!
<i>[ Chorus ]</i>
<i> Pippi Longstocking is coming</i>
<i>  into your town </i>
<i>The one no one--</i>
Riding on a motorcycle!
Flying through the air!
I don't know what
I would have done
if they had crashed.
Honey, Pippi
got them home safely
as she always does.
That's what's important.
I've got a feeling Pippi
would never put
those kids' lives in danger.
Do you know,
she told me...
that she used to ride
with her father on the
Wall of Death in Bangkok?
And you believe that?
That Pippi is
the biggest darned liar
that I have ever seen.
And I'll tell you what.
There's going to be trouble.
That Miss Bannister is
on the warpath. She's gonna
have her way with Pippi yet.
What a shame.
[ Annika ]
Whee!
<i>[ Annika ] Have you</i>
<i>seen the splunk yet?</i>
<i>I don't want him to get me.</i>
<i>[ Tommy ]</i>
<i>I'll protect you</i>
<i>if it does.</i>
Be careful,
and don't touch the floor.
<i>The splunk will get you.</i>
And when he does,
he'll tear your legs off...
and stick 'em in your ears.
Do you know,
since Pippi has arrived,
I've never seen
Tommy and Annika so happy.
I never even
see them anymore.
I just miss our happy,
little family dinners.
Look at you.
[ Alfonso Groans ]
Come on!
Then let me go first.
        I can't.
Don't touch the floor.
Come on!
 <i>[ Pippi ]</i>
 <i>Get onto the couch!</i>
<i>[ Tommy ]</i>
<i>Now you've got to get</i>
<i>onto the couch, Annika.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>
I did it!
[ All Laughing,
  Shouting ]
What are you kids doing?
Watch out, Mom.
There's a splunk
on the loose!
I got it!
Get out while the going's good.
Well, come along before
your father sees this mess.
<i>[ Annika ]</i>
<i>We've been having fun, Mom.</i>
Pippi, would you like
to come to dinner?
No, thanks, Mrs. "S."
I promised this fabulous swami
in Chittagong...
that I'd never eat out
on Tuesdays,
and there's nothing worse
than lying to a swami.
Bye-bye.
            Bye, Pippi.
Bye!
Let me give you a hand,
ma'am.
<i>[ Alfonso Whinnies ]</i>
<i>Oh, no.</i>
         <i>What are you doing</i>
         <i>up there?</i>
Looking out for a storm.
Well, come down
at once, please.
Why? Do you have
a new game for us to play?
<i>I'm afraid this will be</i>
<i>no game.</i>
I am the welfare worker
from the county.
And there is a place for you
in our children's home.
 <i>I have come to take you there.</i>
But I already have a place
in a children's home.
               Where?
<i>Well, look.</i>
I am a child, and
this is my home. Therefore
I live in a children's home.
<i>And a very comfortable one</i>
<i>at that.</i>
But no child can live alone.
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>It's unheard of.</i>
Every child needs
adult supervision
and has to go to school.
        [ Alfonso Laughs ]
        School!
Why?
                To learn things,
                of course.
What kinds of things?
Reading, writing,
arithmetic, history,
geography,
all those things
that a person has to know.
Well,
Fridolf taught me how to count,
enough to count my gold.
<i>And as for the other stuff,</i>
<i>I've gotten along fine</i>
<i>without it for ten years.</i>
So, I'm afraid you'll have
to find children...
for your children's home
someplace else.
Well, if you would just
take ahold of that beast,
I want to see
what's going on inside.
Sure.
But if I were you,
I'd wait and come back
on Friday,
'cause today's splunk day
and they're
all over the place.
       I tried to warn her...
       sort of.
<i>[ Crashing ]</i>
That was a trap
to catch a splunk.
They're such a pain,
always trying to steal my gold.
        Get away! Bug off!
If I let them stay,
they'd eat me out of house
and home.
And that wouldn't do,
'cause then I'd have to go
to the children's home with you.
Don't, don't, don't, don't!
I don't know how to thank you
and those kind people in the
town for thinking so much of me.
But take this and give
those poor children in
the home a nice holiday...
with lots of ice cream
and marshmallows.
[ Laughing ]
[ Chittering ]
Oh, give it here!
Wretch!
        Hey!
She took my hat!
 She took my hat!
Okay, okay, I'll tell you what.
Maybe I'll visit
Tommy and Annika's school.
Who knows?
Might even be fun.
I love drawing and painting.
        Good morning.
[ Chittering ]
Mr. Neilson, you sure
are the cleverest monkey...
for painting all
these beautiful pictures.
Thank you very much.
    And the dearest.
Ohh!
What about me?
That's enough.
                [ Mumbles ]
Oh, hello, Alfonso.
I love you too, Alfonso.
I'm so lucky to have
you guys.
Got her, boss!
    Outta there!
Ah, there she is.
Turning my property
into a pigsty.
Ain't yours yet, boss.
[ Laughing ]
No, but it soon will be
if you two idiots
do your stuff.
Listen. She loves
those two stinking animals,
doesn't she?
Right, right.
            [ Laughing ]
Hello. I'm coming.
         <i>[ Tommy ]</i>
         <i>Come on, Pippi.</i>
There's rocks ahead.
Don't worry.
                     <i>Catch!</i>
Oh! Oh, my gosh!
They don't make china
like they used to.
Don't miss these!
What a bozo!
I work my fingers
to the bone cooking for you,
and you mess it all up!
Here's yours.
Oh, thank you.
    Isn't it great to be alive?
What in the world did we do
before Pippi came?
Practically nothing.
Fished, read comics,
played ball.
But now every day
is fantastic.
It's one of those
"perodactyl" things.
<i>[ Tommy ]</i>
<i>That's Jake and</i>
<i>his new flying machine.</i>
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>Gee, I've never seen anything</i>
<i>like that before.</i>
- He invented it himself.
- You mean he actually
  made that thing?
He calls it his autogiro.
He even promised me and Annika
he'd take us up sometime.
Except Dad says no way.
He thinks
it's too dangerous.
<i>[ Man Laughs ]</i>
<i>There it is, boss.</i>
Look, I can fly.
Pippi, don't!
You'll fall!
        You can't really fly!
My papa always says that
if you believe in yourself,
you can do anything.
- <i>[ Ringing Noise ]</i>
- Shoot. That's Mom.
- <i>We gotta go now. We promised.</i>
- Bye!
Bye.
Leave it to us, boss.
Come on. Let's go.
            Okay.
Pippi, there are two
official-looking guys...
coming through the gate
with white jackets on.
Fantastic.
I just love men in uniform.
But policemen are the best.
Ouch!
    Shh!
        [ Knocking ]
Anyone home?
County Animal Control.
Come to fix your livestock.
[ Both Laughing ]
[ Chittering ]
Hey. What are you doing?
What are you doing?
                Wow!
Oh!
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>Watch it!</i>
That's pirates' gold.
And anyone who touches it
will turn to dust.
Look, kid, we got an order
to take your animals
for their shots.
Nobody shoots my animals.
Whoa, whoa.
We're not gonna shoot 'em.
We're just gonna
give 'em a few jabs.
                        Yeah.
<i>Hey, that's my rope!</i>
That's it, kid!
Aaaah!
Okay, kid, if
that's the way you want it!
<i>[ Crashing ]</i>
- Whoa!
- Ohhhh!
And that's the bully tree.
You should be ashamed,
picking on a poor little girl.
Ohhh!
No sense wasting
such a nice day.
You little monster, you!
- Let's play "find the hat."
- Come here, you!
  [ Yells ]
Come and get it!
Let's get the gold
and get out of here.
What? With her yelling
her head off
in full view of everyone?
Get that ladder!
That's the idea.
The view's lovely up here.
I'm gonna get that
strong-armed little freak
if it's the last thing I do.
        Then what?
        They've seen our faces.
Here's what we'll do.
We'll put her in the sack,
and when it gets dark,
we'll get rid of her.
- Here. Don't want you
  to get sunstroke.
- [ Yells ]
    Get up there!
    Go on!
[ Mumbling ]
Bravo! Well done.
Isn't this fun?
I do it every day.
You little brat!
I'm going to pull those
pigtails clear to China.
- Come on, kid!
- <i>[ Pippi Laughing ]</i>
[ Yelling ]
Get off me! Get off me!
Let go!
Let go!
You've had your fun.
What's wrong?
I thought it was
just a game.
<i>When we're finished,</i>
<i>we can have a feast</i>
<i>of Coke and cookies.</i>
Put the ladder here, kid,
and we'll call it a day.
<i>[ Men Shouting ]</i>
Hurry!
Come on! Move it!
Get out of my way!
[ Yelling ]
        You idiot!
Why, you little--
<i>You go for her.</i>
<i>Get her off that horse.</i>
- I'll get you now!
- [ Whinnies ]
- <i>[ Alfonso ]</i>
 <i>I'll get you.</i>
- [ Yelling ]
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>
<i>This is more trouble</i>
<i>than a truckload of baboons!</i>
Oh! Oh-oh!
               [ Chittering ]
<i>[ Yelling Continues ]</i>
They're never gonna
separate us.
Uh-uh. Never,
never, never!
All you had to do
was grab the horse
and the monkey!
We would've been rid
of her forever!
d all that money
just lying there!
Be back in a couple hours.
Get, get down!
Come on. Get out of there!
It's not safe now.
Come on.
What are you doing up here?
I just wanted to see
what it was like to fly.
Careful, careful, careful.
It's dangerous.
            They could take
            your head off.
Who cares?
I once ran into
a headless pirate in Istanbul.
He never knew which way was up.
Well, I'm afraid you're
gonna have to wait a few
years to fly an autogiro.
Yeah, you know,
I risk my life
every time I go up.
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!
That's it.
 That's the idea.
Vroom! Vroom!
Is that all
there is to it?
        No, no, of course not!
Uh, see, you need these
to keep you up...
and the prop
to take you forward.
But it's really a lot more
complicated than that.
Well, I bet
I could do it.
Can I watch you
take off?
                Sure!
And feel free
to come around any time.
I always feel free.
Thanks. Bye.
Bye!
[ Laughing ]
My pop and I have been
shipwrecked so many times...
that there are only eight
or nine islands we haven't
been to in the whole world.
Weren't you afraid?
Well, there was this hurricane,
and the peas flew out
of the soup.
And the ship's cat
flew past me stark naked,
and his fur landed
on my fork.
Excu-- What do you think
you're doing?
The sugar feels sensational
between your toes.
I'm sorry, but we just
don't behave that way
in this household.
Sorry.
[ Clears Throat ]
Now, tell me,
what makes you think
that your father
is still alive?
I know he is.
He'll be back soon.
You can rely on that.
Ahhh.
I can't see a thing!
Pippi, come in the kitchen.
We'll wipe off your face.
It'll be all right.
I think I went a little
too far.
That wasn't funny, Pippi.
Your table manners
are atrocious.
Listen, if I promise
to practice one hour each day,
will you teach me all
that table manners and stuff?
I'll try.
Now I want the real truth.
Your mother--
She is dead, isn't she?
Oh, no!
[ Gasps ]
You see that cloud?
Well, there's
a little hole in it
right above my house.
Whenever I'm in trouble
or I need advice,
I see her face
right about there.
She always helps me
one way or another.
You okay, Pippi?
    You want to play upstairs?
I can't.
Alfonso's dying
for a hay soufflé,
and Mr. Neilson wants
a banana split.
<i>Good night.</i>
<i>Don't let the bedbugs bite.</i>
Oh, wait, oh.
Hold it, kids.
You hold on right there.
I wanna talk to you.
Just hang on there.
 Just hang on.
Honey, I'm really worried
about Pippi.
She's all alone
in that house. There's
no one to take care of her.
Look, don't
get yourself all upset.
Pippi is not our responsibility.
<i>This Miss Bannister,</i>
<i>she has a lot of support</i>
<i>in this town.</i>
I can see why.
The county created
the children's home for kids
who are lost or have no parents.
And it--
It just seems to me that Pippi
fits the bill perfectly.
Poor Pippi.
No mother or father
to look after her.
We've gotta do something.
Something drastic.
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>The boxes are finished.</i>
<i>Where do we put them?</i>
<i>[ Jake ] Be careful</i>
<i>how you mount them.</i>
<i>They gotta be fixed real firm.</i>
<i>[ Sawing, Hammering Noise ]</i>
       What?
Oh.
Oh, this is too much.
This is just too much!
What the heck
could she be doing
at 3:00 in the morning?
Can we-- I say,
can we possibly have
a little peace and quiet here?
Go to bed!
Don't fuss.
You're getting rid of her
tomorrow, aren't you?
I wouldn't exactly say
that I'm getting rid of her.
But, eh, eh--
What, you don't approve?
You know I don't.
Not at all.
<i>[ Hammering Continues ]</i>
<i>[ Children ]</i>
<i>Twelve times sixteen...</i>
<i>equals 192.</i>
<i>[ Teacher ] Children, eyes</i>
<i>to the blackboard, please.</i>
   Tommy.
Tommy?
Twelve times twelve equals
one hundred and forty-four.
                    Annika?
Pippi, how can I teach
arithmetic with you sitting
there? Please come inside.
Well, I don't want
to upset you.
I'm just curious.
<i>I've never been</i>
<i>to school before.</i>
Except in Wagga Wagga.
That's in Australia.
They chased wallabies
all day long.
       And we had koala bears
       sitting in on--
<i>Enough, Pippi.</i>
I'm afraid you can't stay there.
It's disrupting the class.
Children, back to your seats.
I was just hoping
all that learning floating
around in there...
might fly out here
and stick to me...
and Mr. Neilson.
<i>He's very bad</i>
<i>with his numbers.</i>
                   Yeah.
I'd like to help you,
but you make that impossible.
Whenever you're ready, come
to school like everyone else,
and I'll teach you.
But now we must press on.
                         <i>Bye.</i>
Well, I guess we'll
just have to stay stupid.
Oh, dear.
Thank you. Will you wait here
for five minutes, please?
[ Fire Truck Bells Clanging,
  Siren Wailing ]
You have the order?
                Yes, yes, yes.
Good. Then everything
is absolutely legal.
Excuse me.
Is all this really necessary?
I mean, she's just a child.
A child? I've seen
this child in action.
She's totally irresponsible.
But a fire engine?
Now, why do we need that?
Because the brat climbs up
on roofs and in trees.
And I've seen her up there.
She is more slippery
than that filthy monkey
she lives with,
    not to mention
    that stinking horse of hers.
Why the police?
Oh, she's very strong.
You should see what
she did.
She threw my men up in a tree.
Then she lifted me
like I was a baby.
That's some baby,
I'll tell ya.
I think you'll agree we have
to be prepared for anything
this girl may come up with.
We are agreed.
Now, nobody wants to be
unfair or unkind to Pippi.
But I think that once
she is safe in the van,
then the whole town
can just breathe
a sigh of relief.
[ Siren Wailing ]
[ Siren Wailing ]
            [ Bell Clanging ]
Tommy, Annika!
<i>Pippi,</i>
<i>they're comin' for you!</i>
The police, the fire engine,
Miss Bannister!
Just about everyone.
<i>I bet my father's</i>
<i>with them too.</i>
<i>They can't take you, Pippi.</i>
We're going to run away.
Please come with us.
Yeah, come with us.
Mom and Dad are trying
 ruin everything for us.
Well, I've never run away
from anything.
But I can't let you guys
go off on your own.
So I guess I'll have
to come with ya.
Let's go.
Good luck!
 <i>Thanks, freckle-face.</i>
[ Tommy ]
How we gonna run away?
It just so happens I might have
exactly what we need.
[ Siren Wailing ]
    [ Bell Clanging ]
<i>[ Whirring,</i>
<i> Clattering Noise ]</i>
Good God!
Look at that!
- All right!
- Get-Get out! Get out!
- We'll go after her!
<i>If I could fly,</i>
<i>I could catch them!</i>
[ Siren Wailing ]
Oh, my God!
<i>Keep pedaling.</i>
<i>I'll bring it up.</i>
- Up, up, up!
- Up! Up!
Up! Up!
[ Pippi And Kids ]
 Flying off
  to who knows where
The very air
 we breathe is sweet
Up above the treetops
 there is not a challenge
 we can't meet
<i>If it takes all day</i>
<i> or maybe longer </i>
<i>If it takes all night</i>
<i>We will make our way</i>
<i> We're gettin' stronger</i>
<i>Freedom is worth the fight</i>
Running away
                   Up!
Running away
Up! Up!
<i>Running away</i>
We're running away
[ Chittering ]
<i>Uh-oh.</i>
What the heck
is she doing now?
    You want us to take her,
    boss?
Can we, boss? Please, boss?
<i>Please?</i>
[ Nickering ]
[ Sighs ]
Oh, Pippi.
How could you have done this
to us?
I always thought the kids
would be perfectly safe
with you.
That you'd look
after them... somehow.
   Here, boy.
   Come on. Come on.
<i>[ Siren Wailing ]</i>
[ Father ]
Stop this thing now.
Make it-- Come on.
Will you please stop
this dang-dong bell? Stop it!
            Did you find them?
Not a trace.
Boy, that Pippi
has really done it this time.
Are you sure they were flying?
-Looked like a flying bed to me.
-A bicycle.
 She was definitely pedaling.
No! When it passed
my place, it looked li
that autogiro thing Jake built.
Then let's go see
that crazy flying goon!
-Come on. Let's get outta here.
-Stick around. Don't leave
 in case they come back.
<i>[ Fire Chief ]</i>
<i>Watch out!</i>
<i>Don't hit the horses!</i>
[ Siren Wailing ]
    [ Horses Whinnying ]
I'm starving!
What are you doing, Pippi?
I learned this
from a native in Borneo.
Don't worry. It'll work.
<i>It'll work fine.</i>
See? It works!
- Wow! It really did work.
- <i>[ Pippi ] No sweat.</i>
<i>[ Tommy ]</i>
<i>What are we gonna eat, Pippi?</i>
<i>What have you got in there?</i>
Catch.
I don't feel like
hunting tonight.
What would you hunt here
anyway, Pippi?
Oh, lions, tigers...
and cannibals.
I'm very good
with cannibals.
Cannibals? Here?
Just in case.
It's very quiet.
You don't think
it's too quiet, do you?
I promise you,
with this old gun,
I'll be able to defend us.
Even if we should
be attacked by a splunk!
[ Laughing ]
Oh, I'm gonna go
take a nap.
Wake me if you need me.
And keep your eyes peeled.
[ Laughing ]
<i>[ Screeching ]</i>
<i>[ Bird Squawking ]</i>
<i>[ Growling ]</i>
[ Rustling ]
             <i>[ Annika ]</i>
             <i>Pippi!</i>
Pippi!
There.
What did I tell you? It
could be a cannibal snooping.
<i>You can never</i>
<i>be too careful.</i>
Wouldn't be much use
running away if we're just
to be served up for dinner...
with carrots and parsley.
I'll bet they're looking
through their cookbooks
right now,
learning how to make us
in a special stew.
<i>But I'll tell you this:</i>
<i>If they ever put me...</i>
on the same plate
as spinach--
Yech!
I will never,
ever forgive them.
Oh, Pippi,
don't talk like that.
<i>[ Distant Roaring ]</i>
        <i>[ Annika ] Jeepers!</i>
        <i>What was that?</i>
<i>[ Animal Exhaling Loudly ]</i>
[ Simulating Gunfire ]
- <i>[ Tommy ] She shot it!</i>
- Three of them
  just bit the dust.
Pippi, when I grow up,
I'm gonna be a pirate,
just like you.
Swell. And
we'll be the terrors
of the Caribbean.
We'll plunder gold and jewels
and hide our treasures
in a cave...
with three skeletons
guarding it!
                And we'll sing--
[ Together ]
 Life is a breeze
  We live it for fun
<i>No apologies to anyone</i>
<i>We live on the seas</i>
<i>  We do as we please</i>
You've got it!
And everyone would turn pale and
throw themselves into the sea...
to escape our bloody,
bloody revenge!
What about me?
I don't dare
become a pirate.
Well, you can come along
for the ride and dust the piano.
- Dust the piano?
- Look what I found.
From a shipwrecked sailor's
secret stash.
 <i>[ Annika ] Thanks.</i>
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
<i>[ Pippi Sighing ]</i>
Darn it! We forgot
to brush our teeth.
<i>[ Annika ]</i>
<i>Go to sleep.</i>
Without your help, darn it,
Pippi never would've been able
to build that contraption.
I know. And I'm willing
to help, but it's night.
        We'll use searchlights.
Even if I could
get the autogiro up in the dark,
I could never land it.
       [ Man ] We gotta
       find those kids somehow.
<i>[ Man #2 ] It's all your fault.</i>
    Listen, guys--
[ Man ] You gotta help, Jake,
or we'll run you out of town.
If you're not too scared to fly,
I'll take you up at first light,
and we'll look in places
these guys could never go,
okay?
                    Okay.
What's for breakfast?
     <i>[ Pippi ] Dinosaur eggs,</i>
     <i>sunny-side up.</i>
Pippi! The plane!
It's sinking!
How will we ever get back?
    We're supposed to be
    running away, aren't we?
We're lost.
I want my mom.
- We can't stay gone forever.
- Robinson Crusoe did.
  He stayed for seven years.
- Seven years?
- I don't wanna stay that long.
Three years, okay?
Whew.
It's getting hot.
Wanna go for a swim
before breakfast?
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Pippi, you still</i>
<i>got all your clothes on!</i>
I know.
It's more fun this way.
They can't
have gone this far!
Hey! Don't forget!
They have one
of my flying machines!
[ All Screeching ]
[ Screeching Continues ]
Hey, listen.
I'm the killer whale, and
you're the shipwrecked kids!
[ Pippi ]
Race you to shore.
<i>[ All Giggling ]</i>
- [ Annika ]
  These stones hurt my feet.
- [ Tommy ] Always complaining.
[ Tommy ]
Come on.
Oh, no! Our clothes!
They're gone!
        Somebody's taken them.
They have
to be here somewhere.
The dinosaur, I guess.
A fair exchange
for the eggs.
Now you know why I swim
with my clothes on.
    What are we gonna do?
Nah.
[ Whistles ]
Sit down!
You'll either
lose your head
or make us crash.
There's no sign of them!
Go back to the lake!
If I know Pippi,
she'll be finding some way
back home!
[ All ]
 If it takes all day
  or maybe longer
If it takes all night
We will make our way
 We're gettin' stronger
Freedom is worth the fight
Runnin' away
Runnin' away
We're saved!
[ Tommy ] What do you mean,
we're saved, Pippi?
    [ Pippi ] You'll see.
Never gonna find 'em.
[ Whistles ]
I'm gonna follow that river!
[ Pippi ]
This is as safe
as taking a Sunday stroll.
I once knew a guy who
went down the Niagara Falls
in a barrel.
He said it was fantastic.
[ All ]
 Tiny people on the ground
We're too high up
 to hear them scream
Tryin' hard
 to pull us down
They have forgotten
 how to dream
Runnin' until we drop
 or maybe longer
Runnin' until we win
We'll end up on top
 There's no one stronger
That's the mood we're in
Runnin' away
Runnin' away
Hey, there!
Turn around!
Turn around!
        [ Tommy ]
        You okay, Pippi?
[ Pippi ] I'm fantastic.
[ Tommy ]
Is this safe?
    Pippi, I'm scared.
        Hold on. Don't worry.
What's that big noise
up there?
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>It must be a waterfall, but</i>
<i>it can't be as big as Niagara.</i>
   Grab hold of the paddle!
   Hurry!
<i>[ Annika Screams ]</i>
I'm trying!
Help, Pippi!
Get it! Hurry!
We'll come out on top
like we always do!
[ Tommy ]
We're gonna go over the falls!
My barrel's leaking.
<i>There they are-- down there!</i>
<i>I'll drop the ladder!</i>
<i>[ Tommy ]</i>
<i>Help!</i>
<i>[ Annika Screaming ]</i>
        I think we'll make it!
        Help!
[ Screaming ] Help!
- [ Tommy ] Look!
  It's Jake! Help! Help!
- Go lower!
<i>[ Kids ] Help! Help!</i>
<i>[ Jake ]</i>
<i>I'll go as low as I can.</i>
[ All Shouting ]
- <i>[ Tommy ]</i>
 <i>We're down here!</i>
- Hold it steady!
- Yeah. Okay. I will.
- <i>[ Tommy ]</i>
 <i>Help! Help!</i>
<i>Kids, kids, grab hold of it!</i>
<i>Grab hold of the ladder!</i>
<i>[ Tommy ]</i>
<i>Help!</i>
- [ Pippi ] Grab hold of it!
- [ Tommy ] I've got it!
- That's good! Stay there!
[ Pippi ]
Come on! Get it, Tommy!
Hold it steady!
    Don't move around so much!
[ Pippi ]
Get ahold of it! Hang on!
- <i>[ Tommy ]</i>
 <i>  Then Dad dropped the rope!</i>
- And Pippi grabbed ahold of it.
    Then we got ahold of Pippi.
We all went swinging over
the treetops and fire engines.
   And now you're
   making it up just like--
<i>[ Siren Wailing ]</i>
And everybody
lived happily ever after.
You know, when I grow up,
maybe I'm not gonna
be a pirate.
I'm seriously thinking
of changing it to a pilot.
Pippi, I don't think
you understand.
You really
went too far this time.
But there's
good old Villa Villekulla
still there.
Nobody's been hurt, and we all
did things we've never done
before, and we had a ball.
[ Siren
  Continues Wailing ]
[ Kids ] Bye, Pippi!
Sleep tight! See you!
Bye!
See you tomorrow!
<i>[ Pippi ]</i>
<i>You got a neat fire engine.</i>
Well, I hope
you're satisfied,
young lady.
All those poor people
out of their beds and
out of their minds...
because of your stupidity--
psst, psst, psst--
and your irresponsibili--
bility.
[ Mumbles ]
Hi, Alfonso.
You okay?
        [ Whinnying ]
You know, quite often,
people go to bed
too early anyway...
just because they haven't
had anything exciting
to do.
[ Groans ]
I do wish
I'd asked that nice man for
a ride on his fire engine.
<i>[ Sighs ]</i>
<i>Do you realize</i>
<i>all those people...</i>
<i>have lost time and money</i>
<i>searching for you?</i>
Well,
if that's the only problem,
I've got tons of gold inside.
<i>Come on in.</i>
<i>I don't want anybody</i>
<i>to be unhappy,</i>
<i>so they can each</i>
<i>have two gold coins</i>
<i>from the Spanish Main...</i>
to remind them
of this fantastic day.
[ Groans ]
This place.
It's still a pigsty.
- <i>It's worse than ever.</i>
- <i>[ Pippi ] When you've been</i>
  on an expedition like we were,
you expect things
to get a little dusty.
               You see?
<i>[ Coins Clatter</i>
<i> To Ground ]</i>
                What day is it?
It's Friday.
Great.
    I can start spring cleaning.
    You can help too.
Hmm?
Don't you realize
that it's 2:00 in the morning?
All normal children
are in bed.
Pippi, dear,
you can't go on like this.
                You're worn out.
                 You're dirty.
[ Yawning ]
And you have no sense
of values.
Now, I want you
to listen just once--
just once.
We have this home...
where children like you
are looked after when they
have no mothers or fathers.
Now, I have the power
to force you--
I urge you
to come along peacefully.
<i>This is for your own good.</i>
<i>Now, please.</i>
Just try.
 Just, say, till Christmas?
Can I ride the fire engine?
If that's what it takes.
Just till Christmas.
[ Sighs ]
Don't worry, Counselor.
I'll keep my eye on her.
Boy, I hope we've done
the right thing. My children
are just gonna hate me.
They'll adjust, like
well must eventually.
[ Chuckles ]
        Thank you for your help.
         Thank you.
Yeah, and thank you.
Mr. Settigren, excuse me.
Any luck with the search?
[ Sighs ] No. No.
I can't seem to find any record
of a sea captain...
with the name of "Efraim"
or "Longstocking."
And the Coast Guard registry
doesn't have any ship listed
under the name of <i>Hoptoad.</i>
[ Wheezing Laugh ]
However, I am going
to have a guard posted
at the Villa Villekulla...
just in case anybody
gets any ideas
about any empty property,
just until we get
to the bottom of this.
- [ Engine Starts ]
- [ Both Laughing ]
    Get off my car!
[ Grunts ]
<i>[ Woman ] Class, I want you</i>
<i>to go to work on the 12</i>
<i>problems I've given you...</i>
<i>while I go to work</i>
<i>on another little problem.</i>
[ All ]
Yes, Miss Messerschmidt.
<i>Pippilotta--</i>
<i>If that really is</i>
<i>your ridiculous name--</i>
I want to know:
How much is 12 and 15?
If you don't know something
as simple as that,
you shouldn't be teaching.
- I won't stand
  for rudeness in this class.
- Then please sit down.
I'm warning you, young lady.
We have ways of dealing
with rude, unruly children.
- Haven't we, class?
- [ All ]
  Yes, Miss Messerschmidt.
For your information,
12 and 15 are 27.
But if you knew,
why did you ask me?
Thirteen plus fourteen?
Oh, about 67.
No. It's 27.
But you just said
12 and 15 was 27. I do wish
you'd make up your mind.
Ouch! That hurt!
That was my intention.
You've asked for it.
Now, go over there,
and don't speak another word
till I give you permission.
It's no good.
They won't even let her
come to the window.
She's being disciplined.
        [ Tommy ]
        Poor Pippi.
    Do you think
    we'll ever see her again?
Oh, I'm sure we will.
<i>[ Children Laughing,</i>
<i>  Chattering ]</i>
<i>[ Girl ]</i>
<i>Jennifer! Away!</i>
<i>[ Girls Giggling ]</i>
<i>[ Girl ]</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
[ Girls Laughing ]
        What'd you do that for?
You know very well.
Hey, Pippi, you'll make
the pillow all dirty.
In Australia,
everybody sleeps upside down.
        [ All Laughing ]
I think it's time someone
told you that in Australia...
<i>it's strictly against the law</i>
<i>to have lessons.</i>
It may happen that one
Aussie kid might sneak into
his closet to study a lesson,
but it's too bad
if his mother finds him.
[ Scattered Giggling ]
[ All ]
Whoa! How did you do that?
Arithmetic--
They don't have
at all in China.
If any kid knows
what 12 and 15 is,
he'll have to stand
in the corner all day.
If that's true,
what do they do all day
in school?
Eat caramels.
There's a long pipe...
that goes
from the caramel factory
right into the classroom.
And it shoots candies
out of it all day long.
- What does the teacher do?
- Takes the paper
  off the caramels for the kids.
You don't think
they do it themselves!
You're nothing
but a great, big liar, like
Miss Messerschmidt says.
And who said you could
braid your hair again?
Why are you so bossy
all the time? Don't you ever
do anything you wanna do?
We were okay
until you came.
But why would you want
to stay here?
<i>They give us food and shelter,</i>
<i>and they take care of us.</i>
Sometimes they're nice to us,
if we're good and do
as we're told.
[ Screeches ] What are you
doing in here? Get out of
my dormitory, you naughty boys.
<i>[ All Laughing ]</i>
I don't understand.
            Well done, Pippi.
I really don't understand.
Pippi! How can you
make all this mess?
<i>Wait till Miss Messerschmidt</i>
<i>sees what you've done.</i>
Just think. How am I
supposed to draw a real horse
on a tiny piece of paper?
- Miss Messerschmidt!
  Miss Messerschmidt!
- [ Mouthing Words ]
- <i>Come quick! Come and see</i>
 <i>  what Pippi has done.</i>
- [ Boy ] Whoa!
You. What do you think
you're doing?
<i>I can't leave you alone</i>
<i>for five minutes without</i>
<i>your disrupting the class...</i>
and defacing
the school premises.
Back to your desks, class,
and carry on with your work.
You see that little hut?
That's called the sweat box,
<i>where really bad children</i>
<i>are put.</i>
<i>Mom, I hope</i>
<i>you're not too busy up there,</i>
you know,
playing the harp and all.
But you know
what your Pippilotta's
been going through.
Why do they
ask so many questions when
they already know the answers?
I mean,
a horse is a horse.
I'm so confused.
If only Papa were here.
Then we'd know
the right thing to do.
I wish he was.
What? I didn't
quite hear you.
Get a message to him?
But how?
In a bottle?
Oh, thanks, Mom.
My problem's solved.
Oh. You can go back
to playing your harp now.
Shh.
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Once, I had four jacks</i>
<i>and lost to four queens.</i>
<i>It'll never happen again,</i>
<i>though.</i>
<i>This little hand right here</i>
<i>should be enough to win.</i>
            Yeah. Two bucks
            says you ain't got--
Flush.
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Where'd you get that, huh?</i>
<i>Where'd you get them cards?</i>
<i>[ Object Clanking ]</i>
[ Cries Out, Muffled ]
                    Shh.
What are
you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You're not a ghost.
I'm Greg,
of Gregory's Gripping Glue.
And I'm very sleepy.
Well, there'plenty
of beds downstairs.
[ Cans Rattling ]
<i>How did you get up here?</i>
<i>You certainly didn't come</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>
- I climbed up.
- On a ladder?
No. Up the wall.
            Up a drainpipe,
            I guess.
I walked up.
Now you're telling whoppers
worse than me. Only flies
can walk up walls.
And spiders and lizards
 and me!
        How did you do it?
I'll show you.
Give me your shoe.
            What is that stuff?
This is a very special glue.
Now the other one.
It sticks when you want it to,
and it leaves go
when you're through.
I invented it, and someday
I'm going to be very rich.
            What do we do now?
Now you're going
to climb up the wall.
<i>There. Go on.</i>
<i>You can do it.</i>
[ Grunting ]
 <i>Well, go on.</i>
I can't do it.
Of course you can.
You can do almost anything
you want to...
if you believe you can!
That's what
I always used to say.
Okay. Why not?
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i> Sticky situation</i>
 <i> My departure</i>
 <i>  has to be a fast one</i>
You're doing it!
 <i> Sticky situation </i>
You're walking up the wall.
<i>Every step is harder</i>
<i> than the last one </i>
<i>Been in a lot of spots</i>
<i>And had to use my ingenuity </i>
  Terrific!
   I'm walking on the ceiling!
<i>The going gets too hot</i>
<i>And soon the going</i>
<i> sees the last of me</i>
You see?
No sweat!
And it was fun!
[ Wheezing Cough ]
<i>Anyone up there? I don't know.</i>
<i>Those rats get bigger</i>
<i>every week.</i>
<i>[ Metal Clanking ]</i>
[ Whispers ]
Whoa.
            Can you write?
Of course I can.
But right now, I'm going
to take my little snooze.
Listen, Mr. Gregory.
They don't know
I have this.
But you can buy
just about anything
with it.
If you'll stay awake long enough
to write me an S.O.S.,
it's yours.
It's gold!
I don't want your money.
What kind of an S.O.S.?
                    To my papa.
Please write:
"Pippilotta in the jam pot.
 Come quick. Villa Villekulla."
It's a little bit
more difficult going down.
Well, I can try.
All right.
I'll put the note
in the bottle.
Throw it down to me
when I get down
to the ground.
All right.
        All right.
        Give me your hands.
Just for the start.
Turn me around.
Now, Gregory's Glue
won't let you down.
<i>Now, just trust it.</i>
<i>Remember:</i>
<i>You must believe.</i>
I'll try. Have a nice nap.
And thanks.
[ Grunting ]
You're doing it, Pippi.
This is great.
[ Grunting ]
     <i>Pippi, you're doing it!</i>
- I told you--
  if you would just believe.
- [ Gasps ]
Ohh.
[ Whimpering ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Oh.
I can't move.
I'm stuck.
Oh. Well, just jump.
Papa always says
to leave room for your toes
to wiggle.
Here we go!
Thanks, Gregory.
Now, I want you
to swim straight to my papa,
and no stops on the way.
[ Whistling Through Air ]
         <i>Well, that's that.</i>
- <i>[ Sirens Wailing ]</i>
- Oh, my gosh!
<i>[ Siren Winds Down ]</i>
Oh, my God! Fire!
    [ All Shouting ]
[ Children ] Help! Fire!
[ Gasps ]
Oh.
[ Firefighter ]
All right! Get the hose off
and get that ladder over there!
<i>Get the children out of there!</i>
<i>Hurry up!</i>
- Please let me through!
  Let me through! Gregory!
- Help! I'm trapped!
Don't worry, Gregory!
Pippi's back!
<i>[ Gregory ]</i>
<i>The whole place is on fire!</i>
<i>Please help!</i>
Hey, shoes, where are you?
I can't climb
without my shoes.
[ Children Chattering,
  Crying ]
        [ Officer ]
        How many more inside?
Oh, there are ten.
<i>Oh, that Longstocking child!</i>
<i>Pippi, how did you get</i>
<i>down there?</i>
My mom lent me her wings,
and I flew.
                     <i>Oh!</i>
Can't you ever stop
telling those stories,
even at a time like this?
There's a man up there, and
he surely doesn't have wings.
 <i>[ People Screaming ]</i>
Come on, kids! Hurry, hurry!
Don't be frightened.
Help!
       [ Confused Chattering,
         Screaming ]
<i>[ Man ] Move those hoses!</i>
<i>Volunteers to hold the net.</i>
<i>Come on! Come on! Come on!</i>
<i>The ladder won't reach.</i>
<i>Don't worry, Gregory.</i>
<i>I'll save you.</i>
- We're trapped!
- [ Firefighter ] You can jump
  as soon as they open the net.
-[ Pippi ] Tell the Glue Man
 to jump first.
-Glue Man? What's a Glue Man?
My friend up there.
Gregory, you'll have
to jump first.
Don't worry.
I'll save them.
- <i>Now, it's perfectly safe.</i>
- He's gonna jump.
- It's all right.
  I'll get them down!
- <i>[ Billy ] Help! Help!</i>
It's much easier
than walking down a wall.
                    What wall?
                You got a rope?
Yeah. Right there
in the back.
Don't worry!
It's all right!
I'll get them out!
Bravo, Gregory!
Hi, Tommy and Annika.
    Oh, Pippi, I'm so glad
    you're okay.
We came to rescue you.
You'll be safe.
Whoa-oa-oa!
<i>[ Chattering, Shouting</i>
<i>  Continue ]</i>
- Come on!
  Don't be afraid! Jump!
- Help!
It's Chrissy and Billy!

exactly what I need.
You've gotta jump!
Close your eyes and jump!
<i>The boy first!</i>
   [ Chattering Continues ]
<i>Now, listen, kid:</i>
<i>Close your eyes and jump.</i>
   [ Mr. Neilson Chittering ]
- [ Both Screaming ]
- Come on! Come on!
  It's fun!
<i>I did it,</i>
<i>and I'm all right!</i>
<i>[ Billy ] Pippi! Help!</i>
- <i>Pippi! Pippi!</i>
- <i>[ Mrs. Settigren ]</i>
 <i>What's she doing?</i>
Now, you're gonna take this rope
over there. Just jump.
It's not gonna hurt you.
- <i>[ People Gasping ]</i>
- <i>Get some water on that cable!</i>
- Well done, Mr. Neilson.
- <i>Tie the rope to something.</i>
- <i>[ Firefighter ]</i>
 <i>  We need more pressure.</i>
<i>[ Billy ]</i>
<i>Help! Pippi! Save us!</i>
<i>We're gonna burn!</i>
                     <i>Help!</i>

 She did it! She did--
Uh-oh.
Put your head

Okay. There.
Let them jump.
We'll catch them.

Run along the ropes.
You're a monkey, aren't you?
Mr. Neilson,
I don't want roast monkey

 <i>Stop fooling around.</i>
- [ Continues Chittering ]
- Very well.

- Come on, you silly boy.

- How can I make it up to you?
- I'd really like to go back

you hadn't drowned.

I could no more drown than

Ah, you'd never
believe what happened.
Well, now.
At first, the islanders
wanted to eat me.

-Are you really
 a cannibal king?
-Aye, but there's no danger now.
I converted them
