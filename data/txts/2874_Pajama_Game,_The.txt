Come in!
All right, girls. Mind your p's and q's.
Efficiency. That's what I'm here for.
"The pajama game is the game I'm in
"And I'm proud to be in the pajama game
"I love it
"I can hardly wait to wake
And get to work at 8:00
"Nothing is quite the same
As the pajama game"
If you're so all-fired efficient,
how come you're here looking for a job?
I consider Sleeptite pajamas
a quality product, Mr. Hasler.
Something I'd be proud
to be connected with.
You would? Well, might as well
give you a trial.
I've tried the old ones,
I might as well try the young ones.
It isn't easy, I'm warning you.
I'm not looking for an easy job.
7.5 cents.
7.5 cents! That's what they want now!
I know what's going on here.
I've just written the board of directors.
It's absolutely unnecessary!
- Gladys.
- Yes, Mr. Hasler?
This is Mr. Sorokin.
The new superintendent.
Get him started.
Certainly. Will you come this way?
Miss Hotchkiss.
I suppose you're starting something
with him now.
What are you talking about?
I saw you put your hands on him.
Oh, you make me sick!
Get to work! I'm an executive,
I'm a time-study man.
I've got my stopwatch on you.
Can't waste time.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
"Hurry up
"Hurry up
"Can't waste time
"Can't waste time
When you're racing with the clock
"When you're racing with the clock
And the second hand
"Doesn't understand
That your back may break
"And your fingers ache
And your constitution isn't made of rock!
"It's a losing race when you're racing
Racing, racing with the clock
"It's a losing race when you're racing
Racing, racing with the clock! "
Hurry up, girls. The seconds are ticking.
Can't waste time.
"When will old man Hasler break down
"And come up with our 7.5- Cent raise?
"I can't even buy me
a wreck of a second-hand car
"On that salary he pays"
"What do you think
of the new superintendent? "
He's cute.
He'll never last.
"He's kind of fresh for
a new superintendent"
I like a man with spunk.
You like a man, period!
All right, girls, cut out the laughing.
Hurry up!
Tempus fugit, tempus fugit.
Waste, waste, waste.
Hurry up.
"Hurry up
"Hurry up
"Hurry up. Can't waste time
"Hurry up. Can't waste time
"When you're racing with the clock
"And the second hand doesn't understand
That your back may break

"It's a losing race when you're racing
Racing, racing with the clock
"Can't waste time
Racing with the clock! "
Here's some tape.
Thanks.
A Chicago guy.
He don't belong in this town.
"I'll fix it," he says.
Give him a chance, boys.
He's only been here two days.
Yeah? Pull me out.
Mr. Hasler wants you.
Again?
Give me a screwdriver. I'm nearly done.
I'll tell him you're awful busy.
Thanks.
You know how much they're paying up
at the packing plant? $1.03 up.
Screwdriver!
You know something else? They're paying
$1.14 up at the casket company.
My gosh, you'd be a sensation
up at the casket company.
You could get a job there as a tester
and just lie in coffins all day long.
- Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying.
Well, hurry faster.
Hey, you can't do that to me.
I can't? I just did.
Well, I'll fix you.
I'm getting the Grievance Committee.
Go get them.
It'll give you something to do.
I don't have to take that stuff off nobody.
Go away, boy, you bother me.
I'll show you.
And on my weak arm, too.
That Grievance Committee can start
quite a rhubarb.
This whole town is a rhubarb.
You'll get used to it.
I sure intend to.
You! Go to the storeroom
and get me a switch and a piece of cable.
Move!
Mr. Sorokin, I told you to be careful.
When I heard about you beating up
that boy...
I didn't beat him up.
He's dangling his arm
like it hurts something terrible.
Here comes Babe Williams.
Be delighted to talk to him.
All right, mister, here's Babe Williams.
So this is the committee?
That's right, Mr. Sorokin.
This is the committee.
This Grievance Committee is different.
Never mind the snow job.
I'm sorry.
All right, I shoved the kid.
What's the next move?
He says you hit him.
No, I just...
Look, Miss Wilson...
Her name is Miss Williams.
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter.
- He should know the committee's name.
- Mae, take it easy.
Mr. Sorokin, I've got some problems
of my own right now.
This helper says you socked him.
He does?
Let's say I shoved him.
It sounds more refined.
You are not supposed
to strike an employee.
We have rules about that.
For both sides, I hope.
Listen, Miss Williams,
I'll spread it on the table.
This young man needs vocational guidance.
- You think so?
- He wants to be a bank president.
I don't see what all this has to do with it.
You haven't made a very good impression
on the new superintendent.
He ain't got no right to shove me around,
especially on my weak arm.
I've got to get this factory going.
Can't we take this up later?
Of course we can, Mr. Sorokin.
That's in the rule book, too.
Have the nurse check your arm
and send me a report.
Can't shove me around.
It was broke once already.
Thanks for your cooperation,
Miss Williams.
It's all in the rule book.
- I must read that rule book sometime.
- You certainly should.
All I have to say is, you're the cutest
Grievance Committee I've ever dealt with.
That's what I want.
What's going on now?
Come on, girls, let's pull together.
This is a crisis. The tops are 15 minutes
behind the bottoms.
Can't waste time. Hurry up! Hurry up!
I never know what to wear to a picnic.
If you got the style,
it don't matter what you wear.
You elected me president.
You gotta have confidence in me.
This is no time to be talking about
no ultimatums and no strikes.
Yeah, but that 7.5 cents?
There ain't no question we're gonna get
that 7.5- Cent raise.
Other companies are paying it and
we're entitled to it, but we gotta be smart.
Wait until old Hasler's got so many orders
he can't afford to shut the factory down.
Then we got him.
What about that helper yesterday
says the super socked him?
I didn't get no report.
Prez, that's one for the birds.
He hasn't even got a bruise on his arm.
No?
No. The nurse says he's a faker.
I guess maybe that's right.
He's a phony.
If that Sorokin guy had really hit him
he'd break him in two.
Mr. Sorokin is so strong.
He's so wonderful.
What's this?
The new super.
I think he's simply woo-woo, don't you?
I didn't notice.
I noticed.
I thought Babe was noticing, too.
She lit up.
You girls are really...
Love comes at last to Babe Williams!
Will you get off it?
I hardly looked at the man.
I'm the Grievance Committee.
Love? Are you nuts?
Some people can't tell when it hits them.
"All you gotta do is say hello to a man
"And they've got you whispering in his ear
"All you gotta do it seems is work for him
"And they've got you going berserk for him

"Well, of course, you've noticed
"His manly physique

Superintendent's office.
Come in.
Yes, Sid.
Dolores Paradiso, that's her name.
Well, she's supposed to be very elegant.
She can sew a button on a fly like she was
pouring tea for the Queen of England.
Yes, she can pull hair all right.
Them girls had another fight.
Want to buy a ticket for the picnic?
Might as well get it over with.
$1.00 and all the beer you can guzzle.
No beer for me.
Gives me heartburn something awful.
Yeah, me, too.
Oh, you? Here.
You gonna do your knife-throwing act
this year, Mr. Hines?
I suppose. There always seems
to be a demand for it.
Was you honest on the real stage?
That's where I first met him, Poopsie.
He was throwing knives at a woman
at the Majestic Theater.
It's gonna be some picnic.
I saw you! Leaving him a note, huh?
Carrying on with Sorokin.
I saw you put that note on his desk!
I'm not blind.
That's why you wore that low-necked dress
to work today.
You make me scream, Vernon!
You just make me scream!
Okay then, what's in it?
I dare you to tell me what's in it!
Read it, then go cut your throat!
"Okay payroll, $7,502.01."
That means "I love you"...
...in the Morse code.
Ain't you ashamed of yourself, Hinesie?
Now that that's settled, do you think you
could trust me as far as the ladies' room?
I'll never be jealous again, Gladys.
I promise.
Maybe I'll give you cause some day.
I've learnt my lesson.
I'll never be jealous again.
You stick to that now.
Absolutely.
"That's easier said than done
"I can do it!
"I knew it!
"But let's take an example just for fun
"Picture this, you're waiting three hours
For her to come home from a date
"There I am, I'm waiting three hours
For her to come home from a date
"Here she comes, her lipstick is smeared
And she can't seem to walk very straight
"Here she comes, her lipstick is smeared
And she can't seem to walk very straight
"Then she drops a bottle of rye
And not batting an eye
"Says a train wreck made her late"
Well, Hinesie, what would you do then?
"I would trust her, I would trust her
"By george, I swear I would trust her
"No, I'll never be jealous again"
- Nice work, Hinesie.
- I know what I'm doing.
- Now let's take another example.
- Sure, Mabel.
"Picture this, you've nothing to do
So you drop in to chat for a while
"There I am, with nothing to do
So I drop in to chat for a while
"Something's up, the window is open
And Gladys is forcing a smile
"Something's up, the window is open
And Gladys is forcing a smile
"Then you see a hat and a tie
"And a pair of socks
In a nice, neat, little pile"
Well, Hinesie?
"I would trust her, I would trust her
"By george, I swear I would trust her
"No, I'll never be jealous
"I'll never, never, never, never, never
Never be jealous again"
That's the stuff. You're practically cured.
"There will be no more nightmares
to sleep through
"No more keyholes to peep through
"No more bushes to creep through
"That's my plan!
"Well, now that you're a new man
"Picture this: You go to your sweetie's
apartment, you borrow the keys
"There I am, I go to my sweetie's
apartment, I borrow the keys
"There she is, she's giving a sailor
A very affectionate squeeze
"There she is, she's giving a sailor
A very affectionate squeeze
"Then to boot she tells you
She was in the arms of her cousin
"Who's back from overseas"
Her cousin from overseas!
You expect me to believe that?
"I would trust her, I would trust her
"By george, I swear I would trust her
"No, I'll never be jealous
"I'll never, never, never, never, never
Never be jealous again"
Good!
Hinesie, stop it!
Stop it! Hinesie, stop it!
What will Mr. Hasler say?
Have you gone crazy?
Hinesie, stop it! Hinesie, stop it!
Memo: Cutting Foreman.
Too many rejects on rayon-crepe numbers.
What right has the union to run their
Pepsi-Cola machine with our electricity?
What's this? This book
shouldn't be left lying around.
This book!
Mr. Hasler, you scared the life out of me.
It's all right. I've got the key
around my neck.
I don't want it left lying around.
Is that clear?
Yes, Mr. Hasler.
If I can't trust Gladys, who can I trust?
What was my book doing up here anyhow?
The old man's got a bad case
of "bookitis," hasn't he?
Yes.
I wonder if he's got a skeleton
locked in there?
Mabel, tell me something.
What kind of a girl is this Babe Williams?
She's peppy.
I can see that.
Full of life.
Give me Ladies' Pants.
That you, Prez? Sorokin speaking.
Whatever happened to that complaint
from the helper? I'd like to get it settled.
Would you send the Grievance Committee
up to my office?
This afternoon?
No, right away.
Thanks.
I heard you had an eye for her.
You hear things easy around this place.
First thing you know
they'll be talking about us.
Don't think it hasn't been mentioned.
Memo: Head Cutter.
Come in.
Have a seat.
Yes, Mr. Hasler, I'll be right there.
The last six lots went over the estimate.
You better check with your markers.
I wanted to talk to you about
that assault-and-battery case.
We thought that we'd forget about that.
That's a relief.
The committee decided
just to drop the matter.
Well, I wanted to get it straight.
For a while, I thought that you and I
would have to fight a duel.
Seems that won't be necessary.
As a matter of fact,
we have been fighting a duel.
Every time I come on your floor I try
to get you to look at me, but I always lose.
Never a look.
Perhaps I'm just very interested
in my work.
Perhaps.
But, as far as that helper is concerned,
we know that you had provocation.
If you knew what I had to do to get him
to kick across with a screwdriver.
I would've been justified,
if I had socked him.
We won't go into that.
But anyhow, we have it down
in our books as a slight nudge.
I think a little physical punishment
is good for people once in a while.
Oh, you do? Captain Bligh?
No, not exactly.
Sit down for a second, Miss Williams.
I want to talk to you.
How about a date?
What?
How about going out to dinner some night?
Well, I don't know. I...
Maybe check up on some
of the local hotspots?
Thank you very much, Mr. Sorokin,
but I don't think so.
What is this strange power
I have over women?
But it wouldn't work, not at all.
Looks like I struck out that time.
Well, it's nothing personal.
But you see, you're the superintendent...
...and I'm the Grievance Committee.
Memo: Timekeeper, be sure all girls fill
out credit cards properly and check the...
Memo: To Sid Sorokin.
"Hey, there
"You with the stars in your eyes

Who, me?
"Love never made a fool of you"
Not until now.
"You used to be too wise"
Yeah, I was. Once.
"Hey, there"
I hear you.
"You on that high-flying cloud
"Though she won’t throw a crumb to you"
Don't rub it in.
"You think someday she’ll come to you"
Shut up!
"Better forget her
"Forget her!

"Or are you not seeing things too clear?
"Are you too much in love to hear?
"Is it all going in one ear
"And out the other? "
What a day, eh, Prez?
Yeah, solid gold.
I love these picnics. Always come back
from the road for them.
Say, on this last trip I sold a lot
of Sleeptite pajamas, believe me.
You did?
I knocked them for a loop in Massillon,
Chillicothe, Van Wert, Napoleon.
Finest season I ever had, girls.
I'll have to make an announcement.
There won't be enough baked beans...
...but there's plenty of potato salad.
So them that don't care for beans
can go heavy on the salad and vice versa.
I can never remember a time
when competition was so ruthless...
...dealers so cantankerous,
costs outrageous...
...and profit margins sunk so low!
My good friends,
pajamas are at the crossroads.
Well, if it isn't the Grievance Committee?
Should've run faster.
I have a grievance.
A new fella named Sorokin's been
knocking himself out to be...
...a dandy fellow,
but he can't make a score.
Just tell Mr. Sorokin that Miss Williams
is a very cold, hard-boiled doll.
He wouldn't like her if he got to know her.
This way for the knife throwing.
There's the knife throwing.
This I gotta see.
This way for the great
knife-throwing exhibition.
What happened to you?
Stay out in the open.
Don't get down in them woods.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Make way for the old professor.
Let me place my knives.
Hurry, hurry, hurry...
...for a riot of thrills.
Introducing Professor Vernon Hines...
...master of the flying blades.
In his sensational demonstration
of iron nerve and skill.
Is the trained nurse here?
The trained nurse is here.
I am ready.
I beg your forbearance. I'm out of practice.
Hey, Hines, put one here.
If some daring young lady
from the audience...
...consents to stand in front of the board,
I'll show you the act as it should be played.
My mother loves me.
Come on, Mae, you do it.
You're so big he can't miss.
Now cut it out! Behave yourself!
Eleven years in the public eye,
I never drew a drop of blood.
- I'll do it.
- Don't get foolish!
I'll do it!
Can you knock the apple off my head?
That's the spirit, Babe!
You show them, kid.
I don't think she should.
Please, Babe, don't!
- That's my apple.
- I think that's enough.
Give it to me!
Hinesie, you're making us all so frightened!
If you're frightened,
how do you think I feel?
Come on, Hinesie.
Shoot.
Will you just hold perfectly still?
She's shaking.
My goodness, she's shaking!
Something awful is gonna happen.
You better not, Babe.
All right, everybody, will you hold still?
Is it over?
Break it up! Get that stuff out of here!
Break it up, I tell you!
My skill has never been questioned before.
Go drown yourself.
Break it up, all of you, break it up.
My, but you're an impetuous girl.
Where're you going, Mae?
No place special.
I'm not jealous.
I didn't say you were,
I said you were drunk.
Well, you can't have everything.
That defiant policy of yours
is gonna get you in trouble someday.
It's been working out so far.
I've got a new policy in mind
for both you and me.
Let's quit fighting.
What fight?
Come here, Catherine. The new policy.
Gee, Babe, you're terrific!
You're not so bad yourself.
For a superintendent.
Listen, I'm not the superintendent.
What'd you do, resign?
Today I'm just Sid, you're just Babe.
A guy and his girl.
Just because I kissed you
does that make me your girl?
Well, anyway, the feud is over.
This picnic is going to be okay.
- Can you polka?
- Of course not.
Don't you want to be my girl?
- Why don't you answer my question?
- Do I have to?
Absolutely. Now is the historic moment.
How about it? Do you like me?
Of course I do, you silly thing.
You do? Holy smoke, what a picnic!
What a girl! What a day!
Put me down.
"This is my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
"Felt the morning sun I knew that
This was my once-a-year day
"Once-a-year day
Even got a kiss from you
"I feel like hopping up and down
Like a kangaroo
"Jumping fences, climbing trees
What pleases me is what I'll do 'cause
"This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
"Everyone's entitled to be wild
Be a child, be a goof
"Raise the roof
"Once a year
"This is our once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
"Once a year we're jumping fences
This is our once-a-year day
"Once-a-year day
Once a year we lose our senses
"Look at Charlie by the barn
Kissing Katie's ear
- "Charlie's wife is fighting mad
- I'm glad it's only once a year
"Look at Papa Halterbush
Claims he's 93
- "Acting like he's 22
- He's chasing Sadie up a tree
"'Cause this is his once-a-year day

"Raise the roof

Once-a-year day

You know, when you first came here
after that picnic last week...
...Katie says to me, "Don't be a pest.
Don't talk too darn much."
Might be a lot worse
if I didn't talk at all, eh, Sid?
Right.
I always says a railroad man...
...can't be too much of a doggoned pest
'cause he ain't home enough.
You go out on your run tonight, don't you?
Yes, off to Milwaukee, doggone it.
Here's something you don't see every day.
What is it?
A petrified bat.
Oh, Pop!
Sid is not interested in petrified bats.
What the heck, dear, I didn't say he was.
Yeah, I know you.
The tyranny of women.
Well, I'm gonna get my things.
Old No. 15 waits for no man.
Pop belt your ears off?
He's a great guy. I like him.
But I like you better.
No, no.
Wait till Pop goes out.
Sid, do you like stamps?
Oh, Pop!
Even if he don't,
that would interest anyone.
Two sets of Mint Columbians.
Late blocks on every issue since 1919.
Good night, Katie.
Good night.
Come around anytime, Sid.
I'd like to.
He has got a full set of Mint Columbians.
Sure, he has.
That's why I work at Sleeptite.
I feel good, Babe. Feel like home.
Wonder if we've got any onions?
Onions?
I'm going to make a Western.
You want one?
That's my baby, boy.
She wants a Western.
No, honey. I do not want a Western.
Food is not uppermost in my thoughts
at the moment.
I suppose you want some coffee, too.
No, no, it'll keep me awake.
Now cut that out!
What's the matter, lover?
"I don't want to talk small talk
"Now that I'm alone with you
"I don't want to talk small talk
"We've got bigger things to do
"Let's not talk of the weather
"Or the fashions for the fall
"Why don't you stop all this small talk
"I've got something better
For your lips to do
"And that takes no talk...
"...at all
"I gotta buy me a dressy dress
The one that I have is such a mess
"Small talk
"Who will you vote for next election?
How do you like the stamp collection?
"Small talk

"The Pygmy tribes in Africa
May have a war! "
No!
Yes!

"Why don't you stop...
"...all this small talk? "
Like I was saying...
"I've got something better"
What I mean is...
"For your lips... "
I was only...
"...to do"
Look out, I'm cooking.
You sure are.
I love you.
Darling.
There's something we've got to talk about.
What?
I think you're wonderful, and I love you,
but we're in for a lot of trouble.
No, Baby, why should we be?
Because something's going
to come between us.
Who?
It's not any who.
7.5 cents.
Oh, that!
That contract, lover, that's important.
Maybe we should face that...
- Don't talk such nonsense.
- You mustn't treat me like a baby!
- I'm not, darling.
- Then you've got to listen to me!
I don't know why the union is so important
to me, but it is.
I guess you just gotta be on a team.
So that's why no matter what's with us...
...I’m gonna be fighting for my side
and fighting hard.
All right.
How do you feel about me?
I love you terribly.
If we both feel the same way
about each other, isn't that enough?
Oh, you don't know me.
Babe, I love you.
If you can take it, I can.
"I don't want to talk small talk
"I've got something better
"For your lips to do
"And that takes no talk
"And that takes no talk...
"...at all"
Babe, are you happy?
I'm not even touching the ground.
It's good, isn't it?
So good I can hardly believe it.
Tell me.
Again?
Tell me.
I love you.
Tell me!
I love you more than all the heroes
in all the history books in the world.
Tell me!
What a woman! I'll tell you!
"There once was a man
"Who loved a woman
"She was the one he slew a dragon for
"They say that nobody ever loved
as much as he
"But me, I love you more! "
Tell me!
"And there once was a man
"Who loved a woman
"She was the one he gave his kingdom for
"They say that nobody ever loved
as much as he
"But me, I love you more!
"My love is a giant, fierce and defiant
But how can I prove it to you?
"Ain't got no kingdom, no dragon
To back up my bragging
"How can I show what I would do?
"I only know there once was a man
"Who loved a woman
"She was the one he ate that apple for
"They say that nobody ever loved
as much as he
"But me, I love you more! "
Tell me!
"There once was a woman
"Who loved a man
"He was the one that she took poison for
"They say that nobody ever loved
as much as she
"But me, I love you more!
"And there once was a woman
"Who loved a man
"He was the one she swam the channel for
"They say that nobody ever loved
as much as she
"But me, I love you more!
"My love's meteoric, it's merely historic
"A whirlwind, a cyclone on wheels
It rocks the whole solar plexus
"It's bigger than Texas
I just can't tell you how it feels
"I only know there once was a woman
"Who loved a man
"Loved him enough
to cause the Trojan War
"They say that nobody ever loved
as much as she
"But me...
"...I love you more, and more, and more!
"More than a hangman loves his rope?
"More than a dope fiend loves his dope
"More than an Injun loves his scalp?
"More than a yodeler loves his Alps"
More!
I want to be fair.
That’s what I keep telling you.
That’s my whole principal of business.
I want my relations with the union
to be pleasant and profitable.
The committee's talking
to Mr. Hasler right now.
Well, I'm steering clear of that.
I'll go get my lunch.
We ate already.
Let's not adjourn with any hard feelings.
We must preserve that fine Sleeptite spirit.
That's easy to say,
but we're not getting anyplace.
- Going backwards.
- I didn't say "no." I said "not now."
Look, Mr. Hasler, this thing has been
dragging on for months.
The help are getting very jumpy.
Their patience is about worn out.
I want to be fair.
I'm gonna tell you the plain truth,
Mr. Hasler.
We know the company is doing one heck
of a business.
We don't have no education,
but we got eyes and ears.
Everyone in the industry had
a 7.5- Cent raise but us.
As I said, I want to be fair.
That's always been my policy.
So I don't give you a "yes"
and I don't give you a "no."
I say that we have to examine it
and I have to talk to the board.
That's the way we're gonna leave it.
Sure. Come on.
- I told you we wouldn't get no place.
- Another run around.
"He's a fighter," he says. What a line!
What do we do now?
- Slow down.
- That a boy, this is it.
You know what to do.
Slow down.
- You're in charge of this room, Babe.
- I gotcha.
Go to it.
Something's wrong here.
What's the matter?
I guess I'm just overworked
or something, Mr. Hines.
Ever since lunch,
I just can't get the hang of it.
I get the hang of it.
I'm gonna see the superintendent
on what's going on around here.
"Hurry up
"Hurry up
"Hurry up. Can't waste time
"When you're racing with the clock
"And the second hand
"Doesn't understand
"That your back may break
"And your fingers ache
"And your constitution...
"...isn't...
"...made of... "
All right, just a minute.
Now listen to me.
This is a nice show you're putting on,
but I don't like it.
My job's to turn out goods
and that's what we're gonna do.
You have a contract.
I didn't make it, but it's there.
I want a day's work for a day's pay.
I can still hire and fire around here,
you know.
Now let's go!
Somebody jammed the line.
Who did it?
I did.
You're fired.
I am?
Yes.
Well, that's just fine.
I haven't had a vacation in three years.
I need one.
So long, girls.
Get Charlie.
We'll be operating again in 15 minutes.
Now clear out till I call you back.
I have a fuse and a switch.
Boy, look out!
Did you get burned?
Yeah.
Twice.
What’s going on down at the plant,
you all know as good as I.
Any members of the type I run into
from time to time who say:
"What good is the union?
Why should I pay my dues?"
They could get
a mighty good object lesson...
...from where would they be now
in this battle for the 7.5 cents...
...that they wouldn’t get
if it wasn’t for the union!
What’s sure-a-shooting gonna get it!
So leave us all remember...
...that our union should be first
and foremost in our minds...
...next only to our loved ones...
...and the tiny tots and kiddies.
Before we break up, we’re gonna have
a little entertainment.
I hope you’re gonna show
a special courtesy tonight.
A couple of the cutting room boys is got up
an act with Gladys Hotchkiss...
...who is from the front office.
And if these good folk is good enough
to come down here...
...and do this act for us,
the least you can do...
...is not to sneak out the back way
like last time.
The number they got worked up is right
on the nose, because it’s about getting hot.
And fellow union members,
that’s what we’re doing. Getting hot!
Where'd you get the hat?
Quiet! Quiet! Shut up, everybody!
"I got steam heat
"I got steam heat
"I got steam heat
"But I need your love
To keep away the cold
"I got steam heat
"I got steam heat
"I got steam heat
"But I can't get warm
Without your hand to hold
"The radiator's hissing
Still I need your kissing
"To keep me from freezing each night
"I got a hot water bottle
"But nothing I got
Will take the place of you

Listen, Mae, pay attention to the meeting
and quit guzzling all that free beer.
I ain't guzzling, I'm just being sociable.
Sure, Mae's got to keep her strength up.
We can't just sit around here
and do nothing. We gotta make plans.
Hasler ain't gonna give in easy.
We got to slow down.
I mean other things.
More like, for instance...
Like this suggestion I got here
from Jake Pondermeyer.
He says when he was working
at the Ironclad Overall Company...
...and they was having trouble,
they spit tobacco juice...
...in the back-hip pockets of the overalls.
I draw the line at chewing tobacco.
I wasn't suggesting that.
How about if the packers put the size-large
bottoms with the size-small tops?
And like that?
Sure. Now that's what I mean.
That's constructive.
Excuse me.
That's clear thinking.
Hello.
Sure.
Sure, I recognized your voice.
Yes, I am.
No, I can't talk now.
I've been away three days and...
I'm gonna break down
and have another beer.
Look, I have several people here.
It wouldn't do any good anyway.
I'm sorry. Goodbye.
Babe...
...they were saying...
Well, I don't want to get Babe into trouble.
What trouble? I've been fired already.
The union should do something
about that, too.
If she hadn't stood up
and said she did it, we could've.
But if somebody admits they busted up
the company property...
Here's a confidence
just inside the committee.
Some of the buttons ain't being
sewed on so good.
Wait till the salesmen come screaming
back to Hasler.
Hello.
Hi.
Big meeting, huh?
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Pop.
Don't let me interrupt.
Well, that's about it, anyhow.
Let's be thinking of new ways
to jam things up, huh?
All right.
Let me take you home, huh, Mae?
I don't mind.
Well, I gotta step on it.
- Can you give me a lift?
- Sure, come on.
You can drop me off at the drugstore.
Good night, Babe.
And thanks for the beer.
Oh, don't be so nervous.
That's what I like about picnics,
they bring people together.
They sure do.
I never thought you was aware
I was alive until that day.
How could I miss you?
You're the kind that stands out in a crowd.
Have you really been away?
Sure. I went to Chicago
to visit the Lincoln Park Zoo.
Just because we're on different sides,
is that a reason for us to get all balled up?
Looks like it, doesn't it?
Not to me, it doesn't.
What kind of a queen are you anyway?
Haven't you heard?
I'm the sweetheart
of Local 343 Amalgamated...
...Shirt and Pajama Workers of America.
My gosh, Sid, I warned you.
I told you, you know?
You knew all about how I felt.
I think there are certain things
a person has to stand for in this life.
But I guess you forgot about that.
I forget nothing.
They pay me to run the factory.
So run the factory!
You stick to your side and I'll stick to mine.
Listen, Miss Williams...
...I love you.
Corny, ain't it?
Did you hear me?
Babe, can't you see my side of it?
I can't fail at this.
I was a foreman when I bluffed my way
into this job and I'll fight to stay here.
Now that I've got you in my plans
I'm fighting even harder.
Watch those hands, tycoon.
Well, here we are. Hello, Sid,
I thought I heard your voice.
What you got, your stamp album?
Don't get excited.
If Sid don't want to look at it,
he doesn't have to.
There's no law against my looking at it,
is there?
Sid likes stamps, he told me so.
But me...
I'm plain bushed, so if you don't mind,
I'll slide off to bed.
Run along, honey. Good night, dear.
Good night.
Sleep well.
Thanks.
Suppose we start with
the Pan-American Exposition issue of 1901.
I guess that's as good a place
to start as any.
"Hey, there
"You with the stars in your eyes
"Love never made a fool of you
"You used to be too wise
"Hey, there
"You on that high-flying cloud
"Though you've been acting cold to him
"You know your heart
"Is sold to him
"Get on the ball, girl
"Just take it all in your stride
"Don't let him make you fall apart
"You've always had such pride
"Won't you take this advice
"I hand you like a brother
"Or are you not seeing things too clear
"Are you too much in love... "
Hines, this is an emergency! Come on.
The whole country is on the skids.
Here I am right now with employees
openly defiant of top management.
Mr. Hasler, maybe if we offered
a compromise...
Not until there's ice in Hades
three feet thick.
I'm a fighter, Sorokin.
We got hundreds of orders to get out.
That's right, Mr. Hasler.
Here's this letter from Marx and Klein...
Marx and Klein. Wholesalers.
Doggone chain outfit!
Doggone communists!
Want another price cut, I suppose.
I've been looking for you.
Where did you come from?
You look like a medium. I need you.
What on earth is going on here?
Take your pants off.
I'll do no such thing.
This is life and death
to the Sleeptite Organization.
I want him to model these pajamas.
Take your pants off!
Okay, Chief.
- Me? Honest?
- Come on.
What a day!
I'm a very busy man, a time-study man.
I'm not a model.
This is all for Sleeptite.
Hines, put those pajamas on!
Hurry it up. Let's get it over with.
Whatever it is.
I want you to get the picture.
I was showing this to Mr. Robertson
of the Robertson Brothers.
I ain't a salesmen who believes
in half measures.
Whenever I have a sample room,
I do just what we got Hinesie doing.
I model the pants myself.
Beautiful styling. What more do you want?
Now wait. Here I am in Peoria,
I'm modeling the pants.
Mr. Robertson and his two buyers are very
impressed with the line and ready to buy.
Go on, go on.
I hope there's some point to all this.
Take a deep breath.
Stick out your stomach.
This is ridiculous.
Everybody bear in mind
I got these pajamas out of stock.
Right out of the box!
Go on, Hines, breathe.
Take a big breath.
He said to breathe. Breathe!
Let's get it over with.
My gosh!
No, leave them lay.
What are you doing?
Let me see those.
They're all like that.
Boxes and boxes of them.
Who did this?
Somebody's got quite a sense of humor.
What are you talking about?
Two threads in every waistband button.
They're not sewed on.
Somebody's being very cute.
Cute? Sabotage! Open rebellion!
It may be just a coincidence.
Put your pants on!
Sorry, Boss.
What did you do?
Nothing.
I'll be the laughing stock
of the pajama game.
What did Robertson do
when your pants fell down?
He laughed. No sense of humor.
Hold the orders until we check the stock.
I'll be right down.
Come on.
If they think they can lick Myron Hasler,
they've got another guess coming.
I'll go down and I'll fire the whole factory!
I'll nail it up, board it down!
Hines, I want an individual time report
on each individual worker.
I got an individual...
No! My vice-president.
It's partly your fault. Well, do something!
Rip it! Tear it loose!
Mr. Hasler, in this letter
from Marx and Klein they say...
Don't bother me with letters
from Marx and Klein!
Don't forget I've got a meeting
with the board of directors tomorrow!
Two threads! That's what I've got
to tell them! Two threads!
We've got to recall a lot of orders.
- How many?
- They'll tell us.
Sabotage!
I'd like to make a pitch.
All right, pitch ahead.
Let me make my position clear.
I'm for the company first, last and always.
But labor problems have got
to end up in one way:
Compromise.
Sorokin, you've been around here
long enough to learn something.
But you seem a little slow.
I'm a fighter! Keep your dukes up.
Don't waste your breath on me!
Keep your dukes up.
Hey. Cheer up.
Yeah. "Keep your dukes up."
What?
Mr. Hasler wants me
to take boxing lessons.
You certainly are a character.
I would like to get some information
out of you.
What kind?
Double entry.
You're not gonna get any information.
So, there.
I'm a desperate man and I hate to ask
a cute kid like you to do me a favor.
Sid, dear, you wouldn't want me
to violate a trust, would you?
I sure would if it'd help unsnarl things
around here.
Why is that so important?
Because my future depends upon
the titanic struggle for pajama survival.
You're a scream.
I just feel that if...
No, no. Not that.
I wouldn't ask you to show it to me.
Just leave it around.
No.
Besides, it's locked anyhow.
I know a sexy dame
who would lend me the key.
You think so?
It would be fun trying to persuade her.
It might be fun to have you try.
- Well, I gotta go now.
- No, wait.
For what?
Let's go out tonight.
I hope you're not serious about that key?
I don't feel like being serious
about anything.
You're busy, huh?
No.
I sure would like to.
Where will you take me?
Any place you say.
I know a wonderful joint.
"I know a dark, secluded place
"A place where no one knows your face
"A glass of wine, a fast embrace
"It's called Hernando's Hideaway, ole!
"All you see are silhouettes
"And all you hear are castanets
"And no one cares how late it gets
"Not at Hernando's Hideaway, ole!
"At the Golden Fingerbowl
or any place you go
"You will meet your Uncle Max
and everyone you know
"Soon you are sitting close
and making love to me
"You may take my heart
"You may take my soul
"But not my key
"Just knock three times and whisper low
"That you and I were sent by Joe
"Then strike a match and you will know
"You're in Hernando's Hideaway, ole! "
Fresh!
Who's there?
Anybody in here seen Poopsie?
"I know a dark, secluded place
"A place where no one knows your face
"A glass of wine, a fast embrace
"It's called Hernando's Hideaway, ole! "
Joe sent us.
"At the Golden Fingerbowl
or any place you go
"You'll meet your Uncle Max
and everyone you know
"But if you go to the spot
that I am thinking of
"You will be free
"To gaze at me
"And talk of love
"Just knock three times and whisper low
"That you and I were sent by Joe
"Then strike a match and you will know
"You're in Hernando's Hideaway, ole! "
I want to ask you a personal question, Sid.
Do you like scotch?
No, Gladys, I don't like scotch.
Neither do I.
Scotch has a very peculiar taste to it.
Kind of a scotch-like taste?
Yeah, that's it. Count me out.
Is that gin?
Yes, ma'am.
You're right.
You know, I can't figure you out, Sid.
I guess when you first came here you
caught on I thought you were pretty cute.
But you never gave me a tumble
till tonight.
I told you what I was up to, didn't I?
I forget. Tell me again.
I'm gonna get you fried
and get that key away from you.
You'll never get my key.
You'll never get my key!
They'll hear you.
You think I'm terrible, don't you?
- I'd be glad to take you home.
- No, I just asked you to bring me here.
I gotta give someone a message.
Good evening. Shall I get you a table?
- No, thanks. I'm looking for somebody.
- You're welcome.
Hi, folks.
Howdy.
- Hi, Babe.
- Hello, Poopsie.
I thought you was out bowling tonight.
Yeah, I was. I came over
to give somebody a message.
Come on, Sid. Let's dance.
What's the matter, Sid?
I don't feel so good.
You sick, you mean?
Not sick, just kind of depressed.
Look, don't be repressed.
Look what I'm giving you. See.
Well, take it.
It's a lousy trick, Gladys.
Well, I'll just lend it to you.
And don't tell anybody.
You gotta give it back in the morning.
Thanks.
Hi, Babe.
Yes, hello.
Sid and I are just old friends.
- Won't you join us?
- No, thank you.
I came to tell you
that Hinesie is out for blood.
He was over at the bowling alley.
He knows you two are out together.
He's going crazy.
Oh, Hinesie.
- And he's got a knife.
- The fool.
He's always got a knife.
He's living in the past.
That's not healthy. You think so, Sid?
Look, I didn't come here to be funny.
I didn't come here because
I'm craving your company...
...or because I want to join your party.
I just came to tell you that he's dangerous.
He talks dangerous, but he isn't.
I think I'll take a nap.
Move over.
Pay up for me and take Gladys home,
will you?
Sure. Sure, Sid, glad to.
Got some important bookkeeping to do.
Her is the cutest one.
I remember you.
I'm gonna take you home.
All right, but wait a minute,
I gotta take another nap.
Oh, I see you.
You don't need to drop anything.
You abandoned woman! You hussy!
After the way you behaved?
Taking your pants off in Mr. Hasler's office.
Don't touch me. I'm out with friends.
And I'm glad I never married you.
Hello. This is Sorokin, Mr. Hasler.
Sorry to get you out so early.
It's important that I talk to you at once.
I'll be there right away.
Thanks, I'll be waiting for you.
The committee from the union
is waiting to see you.
Yeah, I sent for them.
Come in.
I'm sorry to drag you up here.
You have a union rally tonight.
I want to talk to you first.
That's okay, Sid.
I got ahold of some facts
that may clean up this mess.
Well, it better be quick. Either we get
this raise or we vote to strike.
You're right.
Will you keep your rally going
until I get there and talk to you?
- What about?
- About solving this thing.
There ought to be a time limit.
- You'll parade first?
- We sure are.
That'll give me time.
Well, that's fair enough.
Miss Williams, can I speak to you?
We'll wait for you downstairs, Babe.
I know explanations are lousy...
You've gotta give me a chance to explain.
I don't want explanations. It's humiliating.
You mustn't think that...
I don't think anything, Sid. I don't care.
If it's about you and Gladys,
it's none of my business.
But it is your business.
I'm talking about something bigger
than that.
This is just great. Can't we even talk
to each other and make sense any more?
I don't see how. Not till this is over.
I've been eating mud long enough.
I've had it.
Well then, what do you suggest?
Meet me after the rally tonight.
I can't. I have a date.
Well, that's that.
I'll break it.
I saw you.
Vernon, cut that out!
You're just crazy, that's all.
I'll call the police.
You drove me too far this time.
You'll find out.
I know you're just trying to scare me...
Help!
Sid, you gotta do something!
Vernon is not fooling this time!
- Just calm yourself.
- He's after me!
I'll fix everything.
I'll take him aside
and tell him the whole story.
In the meantime, here's your key.
Listen. I thought I heard something.
You maniac! Hinesie, you idiot!
I'm sure glad he got that out of his system.
But how do you know he has?
Cut it out, Gladys!
Everything's gonna be all right.
You gotta stop him!
I'll fix that baby.
All right, I'm here. I hope this call
turns out to be important.
What's going on around here?
Look! Look!
Now that's not nice.
I don't like this.
This is company property, Sorokin.
I better explain, Mr. Hasler.
I think somebody had better explain.
Help!
They're out to murder me.
I'll stop that.
- Call the police!
- Yes, sir.
It's a plot to murder me!
They've imported gangsters from Chicago.
It's the old Al Capone mob.
I don't think so.
Don't argue! You see those knives?
That's the work of foreigners.
Hines, where you been? On the job, man.
The place is full of gangsters!
They're not after you, they're after me.
Talk! Why doesn't somebody
do something? Get me the police!
You don't want to arrest Hines, do you?
He was trying to kill me.
Suppose you would've succeeded, and me,
right in the middle of labor troubles.
Suppose you would've hit him.
I could have, all right.
I was just trying to scare him.
That's why you called me, to risk my life?
I called you because there's gonna be
a strike tomorrow unless you listen to me.
Have his head patched up.
All right, Vernon.
Leave me alone. I'm a fighter, I am.
Dukes up.
Come on, Tiger.
- Mr. Hasler.
- Yeah?
I'm going before the board of directors.
You are what?
If I can't solve this in any other way.
Solve what?
I've been up all night with your ledger.
What?
I apologize. You didn't hire me as
a safecracker, but I had to get some facts.
I've been through your books.
That 7.5 cents was added
to the cost six months ago.
I can put you in jail, that's what I can do!
Put you in jail!
No, you can't. But you can give that raise.
If you don't, I'll go before the board to tell
them how many orders were cancelled.
- Not one single order.
- There's a dozen cancellations!
You're costing the company
thousands of dollars!
Mabel tried to tell you all day yesterday
about Marx and Klein.
If this operation folds up,
I fold with it, and I don't want to.
So do me a favor.
Sit down and talk to me.
We're sure to win, ain't we, Prez?
What kind of question is that?
Sure, we are. Babe will tell you.
The answer is "yes."
That's the answer to everything tonight.
Babe and me was up half the night
figuring things out.
I got it all written down on paper.
"I figured it out, I figured it out!
"With a pencil and a pad
I figured it out!
"7.5 cents doesn't buy a heck of a lot
"7.5 cents doesn't mean a thing

Hey, Prez!
Yes, Sid?
Mr. Hasler is here and he thinks
he can settle this strike.
Well, how?
Why don't you hear him out?
Okay.
Okay, Mr. Hasler.
My friends!
My friends!
My friends...
...this strife within our ranks
has disturbed me more than you know.
And I think that you realize,
as well as I do...
...that there is only one way
out of a thing like this.
That’s to compromise.
Sleeptite wants to meet you halfway.
We offer a compromise.
We’ll give you 7.5 cents...
...if you give up the claim
to retroactive pay.
We ain't giving up nothing!
Wait a minute. Don't you see?
We've won!
We've won!
We've won!
You were so wonderful! I could kiss you.
I don't want to get kissed
for settling a strike.
Of course, if it's anything personal...
It's very personal.
And I say to you again
in this hour of decision...
...that our responsibility
to the garment industry...
...rings like a battle cry
throughout the land.
Production must increase.
Costs must go down.
And, fellow Sleeptiters...
...I just want to say that this
demonstration of harmony in our factory...
...strikes something deep down inside me.
And I know that this party of yours...
...is going to be a great success...
...because it stems
from that genuine spirit...
...of Sleeptite solidarity.
We say okay to that, M.H.
So on with our tribute
to Sleeptite pajamas!
And now on with
the Sleeptite fashion parade!
Wear Sleeptite at all social functions.
Dresses are fine, but Sleeptite is divine.
Sleeptite has everything:
Grace, style, and comfort.
I'm Grace.
I'm Style.
I'm Comfort.
Wear Sleeptite for a happy family life.
Now I trust her night and day.
That's true love the Sleeptite way.
And another point, Sleeptite is economical.
Married life is lots of fun.
Two can sleep as cheap as one.
