Where is my bride?
My wedding dress.
Quickly, put it on.
Soon you'll live your life in
jewels and not chains.
Come, child.
Your groom awaits you.
Honeybees, all right, all right!
Say Honeybees, all right!
Honeybees, all right, all right!
Say Honeybees, all right!
Go, Honeybees!
- You ready, Hindenberg?
- Yes.
- Great.
- I have one question.
Why am I dressed like
one of the Fenmore Foxes?
Aren't they our hated rivals?
Yes, but... this year's theme
is unity. For all cheerleaders.
Oh.
Have fun.
Wipe out the Foxes!
Boys are cheats and liars
They're such a big disgrace
They will tell you anything
to get to second
Baseball, baseball,
he thinks he's gonna score
If you let him go all the way
then you are a hor-
ticulturist studies flowers.
- Oh, no she didn't.
- Oh, yes she did.
Girlfriend's booty be
all wrapped up in 'licious.
All wrapped up.
You're pretty dope
and phat yourselves.
Ling-Ling,
you forgot lunch, baby-pie.
Chicken back with five
vegetable, bulgogi and kim chee.
- Thanks, Mom.
- OK.
You all learn real good now.
- Ling-Ling?
- Can somebody answer the phone?
Oh, dang. That's messed up.
Of all the Korean liquor stores,
why did my dad
walk into that one?
I'm returning your papers
on the Salem witch trials.
I'm sad to report that Eden here
got the only 'A'.
Well, that's not fair.
I mean, she was the only one
who was actually there.
Hexum maleficium
spiritum sanctum Nostradamu.
- Vice Principal Bernard.
- Oh, Miss Spencer.
Wonderful job this morning.
You certainly know
how to whip up a crowd.
I bet you whipped 'em up when
you were cheerleading captain.
Me? Oh, no, no, no. I was much
more of a band chick, actually.
Tuba. Lead tuba. Honour band.
Then you wouldn't mind
writing us some passes
so we could practise
some new moves?
Oh, Jessica,
I don't know about that.
You know, that trophy is going
to look so good in your office.
Oh, all right!
That's what girls do
Keep you guessing
the whole day through
Play your emotions and
push all your buttons, it's true
That's what girls do
That's really good.
How much do I owe you?
It's OK. It's on the house.
Really?
Thanks!
Who's going to pay for that,
asshole?
You are not going to
make it in this business.
You total binger!
April, this is going to go
straight to your ass.
Itch-bay alert.
Bianca!
Jessica, you look great!
Are you doing
something different,
or hanging out with
skankier friends?
Wow, Bianca,
you look really good too.
Are you eating less
or just barfing more?
Barfing more.
- Good luck at the competition.
- Yeah.
You too.
Bye-bye.
Oh, my gosh!
Let's go, Winona.
Jess,
what are you doing?
Hang on a sec.
Oh!
- This is kind of cool.
- Can I help you, ladies?
- Oh. Yeah. What is this?
- Oh, yeah. I like that too.
It's actually a Senegalese lute
carved from deer-wood.
Used for fertility
rituals and...
Cool.
Oh, and you can
put your weed in there.
Oh!
- Check this out.
- Oh, yeah. That's beautiful.
It's actually a model of the
prison on Robben Island
where Nelson Mandela was held
for 27 years.
Before the collapse of
apartheid, of course.
He came out pretty hate-free,
though. You know, ready to heal.
Went on to become the president
of South Africa after that.
After they freed him,
of course. Sure.
- Wow!
- Yeah.
People don't realise this, but
you can put your weed in there.
Which is great. Sure.
If you have any more questions,
I'll be in the back sleeping.
- Great.
- OK. Thanks.
Oh.
Actually, this is the back.
Sorry.
This stuff makes me feel so
proud to be African-American.
Ling-Ling! You walk right by
Crazy Nail, no say "hi" me.
Hi, Mom.
Bye, girls.
Fake pearls!
Stop banging those drums!
I'm sorry.
I didn't even know
you could hear that.
Oh, my God!
Look at those earrings.
I'll be the envy of
every girl at prom.
Not like that was in jeopardy
or anything.
- Excuse me. How much are these?
- Not for sale.
- That's a genuine artefact.
- Oh.
No!
OK, I'm... all set.
Is that all you got? $18?
It's a gas station. Everybody
pays with credit cards nowadays.
Help yourself to some nachos.
Hey, that's for
Doug Flutie's kids.
I'm in here! Help!
They look really good.
Excuse me.
Gas cap's on that side.
Hello?
Full service.
And could you check the oil and
that other junk under the hood?
Like his job is that hard.
Minimum wage
for a maximum loser.
Good one.
Hey, check this out.
- Sorry. Accident.
- You're so bad!
It's OK. I'm OK.
How much you bet
I can get him again?
Oops.
Ooh-la-la! I'm so pretty.
Booger...!
Booger!
I told you not to
go through my stuff.
What are you doing
wearing my bra?
I'm not. I was simply
holding it against myself.
Get out of my room,
you little turd.
Wait a minute.
What happened to you?
Nothing.
Did that Cavanaugh kid
do this to you?
All right, come here.
He is such a punk. You know...
One of these days
he's going to get it.
There you go. Better.
Is that my lipstick?!
Ohhh!
Hi.
Oh, Jess, when you do that,
my whole leg tingles and shakes.
Really? Well, what happens
if I kiss you...
there?
You have to come snowboarding
with me this weekend.
Silly-Billy-Nilly, I told you,
I'm not having sex with you.
No, no.
We could sip hot chocolate and
play Scrabble with my brother.
Call it whatever you want. I'm
still not having sex with you.
Billy, look.
You know how important
this is to me.
And when that special
moment happens, I just...
I want it to be perfect.
I would never dream of
rushing you.
Thank you, Billy!
If you change your mind
we could drive up together.
I'll wait behind for you.
Front, behind,
I'm still not doing it.
Good night, Billy.
Your life is like a fairy tale.
You and Billy are
totally Disney.
You know, it's scary sometimes.
I just...
I don't know what I'd do
if things weren't so... perfect.
I'm so glad
you're my best friend.
I'll see you tomorrow.
OK. Good night. Bye.
Honey, is everything all right?
Yes, mother. It's just a spider.
A really big, disgusting spider.
Hi, it's April.
Leave me a message.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Oh, sick! Sick.
Hey, Dad. Can I have
this cake for breakfast?
Yeah. Whatever.
Go for it.
Booger, what the hell are you
doing eating my boss's cake?
I thought you just said
I could eat it.
Oh, God!
Where's my...
- Hello?
- April. It's me, Jessica.
I need you to meet me right
after class out by the track.
- Is this really Jessica?
- Yes!
Oh, my God!
Are you getting a cold?
The competition's
only a week away.
We may have bigger problems.
April!
April!
April!
You stay away from me!
I have pepper spray
on my key chain.
April,
I need you so bad right now.
- You have no idea.
- How do you know my name?
It's me!
Jessica!
I'm in here!
What did you do with her?
I don't know what happened.
I woke up this morning...
like this!
What did I tell you
about these things?!
- They go straight to your ass.
- People will be looking for me.
- You got to believe me.
- I'm warning you!
Please, I'm Jessica!
Oh, my God!
I think I broke a rib!
My eyes burn!
I can't breathe!
This morning I woke up a man!
This is by far
the worst day of my life!
April!
Do you remember in second grade
when you moved here
from Arkansas?
Everybody threw rocks at you
because you talked funny
and your front two teeth
were brown.
I was your only friend.
I gave you that locket
round your neck
when your grandmother was sick.
You said...
You said that...
We'd be bestest friends forever.
Boys are cheats and liars
They're such a big disgrace
They will tell you anything
to get to second...
Baseball, baseball
He thinks he's gonna score
If you let him go all the way,
then you are a...
Horticulturist studies flowers
Geologist studies rocks
The only thing a guy wants from
you is a place to put his...
Cockroaches, beetles,
butterflies and bugs
Nothing makes him happier
than a giant pair of
Jugglers and acrobats
A dancing bear named Chuck
All guys really want to do is...
Forget it, no such luck.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
How did this happen?
- I don't know what to do.
- OK, OK.
Here.
Go to my house
and wait for me in my room.
Don't worry. We're going to
figure this thing out.
Here.
Here you go.
You are my bestest,
bestest friend.
- Watch the beard.
- Sorry.
Hi.
OK, she bought it.
I told your mom you're going on
a ski trip with Billy's family.
That'll at least
buy us the weekend.
You think I'll be stuck
like this all weekend?
Gross.
I've got hair everywhere! In my
nose, in my ears, on my chin.
I'm afraid to look
anywhere else.
- It's like I'm an ad for hair.
- OK, well, maybe this'll help.
OK...
Yeah.
OK. Against the grain.
Ready?
Hold still.
So...
So...
What?
Do you really have a penis?
April...!
- Can I see it?
- What is the matter with you?
I don't think you get
the gravity of the situation.
You're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Can I see it?
- What is your problem?
What? It's not every day that
your best friend grows a penis.
You want to see it?
OK, fine.
To shut you up.
Nice!
Nice.
I mean, you know...
I've only seen a couple,
but that's definitely top five.
How many have you seen?
Five.
Not including my little
brother's.
You little tramp!
Mother!
Stan, I am beginning to
worry about April.
She has been acting
rather strange.
- Is it drugs?
- No, no, I...
I think it's her
hormonal development.
She just ate six peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches
and an entire carton
of ice cream.
And what do you
make of this? Hm?
It's April's soap.
Well? What do you think?
I think you need more things
to fill out your day.
OK? Are we done?
Hello?
All right, who is this?
I should have made love to you
when I had the chance.
Father Mulcahy?
Tell me I'm beautiful.
On the inside.
Look...
Jessica has a problem.
She's only going to make us
wait an hour this time?
What about the class trip
to Six Flags?
She took so long in the bathroom
we all missed the bus.
Our parents had to drive three
hours to pick us up.
I had my period, OK?
OK, now that everybody's
up to speed,
can we start thinking about
how I can get my life back?
That's definitely going to cost
you a few votes for prom queen.
Come on, you guys. Let's get
serious. Stop dicking around.
Guys! I got cheerleading
competition, the prom,
none of my clothes fit.
I think I'm going bald...
- And how will I go to school?
- She's right.
OK. Let's think.
What could have caused this?
Maybe it wasn't an accident.
It's got to be one of the people
who hates Jessica that did this.
What are you talking about?
People don't hate me.
You see, Jess, because you are
so beautiful and perfect...
.. certain people might
misconstrue
some of the mean and hurtful
things you say and do to them.
Although the things
you say are funny,
people tend to focus on their
public humiliation and shame.
So you're saying...
people think...
I'm perfect?
Let's make a list of
all the people who hate Jessica.
Know what would be a shorter
list? The people who don't.
You bitch!
Easy on the coffee.
- Oh, hi.
- Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Surprisingly, yes.
You have any...
special dreams?
Not particularly.
- You sure?
- Why?
Oh, my God! My first boner!
There you are! The gardener
from the service, right?
Sí.
Damn lawn's a mess. It's my
daughter's responsibility,
but you know teenage girls.
Sí, sí. Teenageros.
Sorry. Richie Spencer.
Taquito?
Oh, Taquito.
There's the mower.
There's your bag of fertiliser.
I'll let you get to it.
Damn! I love the smell of
fresh-cut grass.
Gracias, but...
I'm not sure I'm old enough,
señor.
Yeah, right! What is the
drinking age in Mexico, 40?
Come on! Take a load off.
You can finish in a minute.
Hope you don't mind
a light beer.
I had to cut back on account of
the bloating. Know what I mean?
I also had to give up the spicy
food on account of my asshole.
We're amongst men, aren't we?
Stinko de Mayo.
You like that car?
That's my daughter's.
- Pretty nice, huh?
- Would've looked better in red.
That's what my daughter said.
We used to go out back and toss
a few baskets, shoot the shit.
She's got her own stuff going on
now. Who could blame her?
- Whole family's falling apart.
- What?
Things with the wife.
Forget about it.
We sleep in the same bed - might
as well be separate countries.
That is, like, so sad.
Ay, ay, ay!
Ay, ay!
I've tried everything.
Nothing worked.
I even got out the razor and
gave myself a porn-star trim.
Want to see? Check it out.
Boy, she used to be wild!
The sex was great.
We'd go at it and she could
still twist around to kiss me.
Señor, información too mucho.
Emotional scarro. Disgusting.
It's good talking to you,
Taquito.
- Hey, Jessica.
- Jessica!
- Hurry!
- Come here.
- We've got a suspect!
- Oh, yes!
Come on.
Something smells like dog poo.
I think I'm sitting next to it.
Come on, Hildenberg.
Don't play dumb.
You hate Jessica, you're good at
this science crap...
Just confess
and give us the antidote.
It's impossible for a woman to
transform into a man overnight.
So you're saying that you had
nothing to do with this?
Look, let's just pretend
this was an alternate universe
where I actually believed you.
Why would I want to
help Jessica out anyway?
Jessica...!
Hildenberg...
I'm sorry that I humiliated you
in front of the entire school.
And the visiting 8th graders.
But you have no idea
what it's like
to wake up every morning
and have to shave your chin.
Yes, I do.
Who's next on the list?
Whoa!
Well, it is cold in here.
- So you never put a hex on me?
- Oh, I've put plenty on you.
To give you dandruff
and make your hair fall out.
Make one of your boobs
bigger than the other.
Oh, I think you got me
with that one!
There's some powerful
occult magic at work here.
Like an ancient spell.
Or voodoo. Or Santería.
What's Santería?
It's a Latin-based
form of witchcraft.
It originated in Africa,
then eventually made its way
to Cuba and Brazil.
- Bianca!
- I knew it.
Most of its rituals
involve a chicken.
That sounds delicious.
- I mean, interesting.
- There's a way to tell.
A true practitioner of Santería
bears the mark of the scorpion
tattooed on their back.
Bianca's always hanging out at
that dance club, Instant Tang.
Yeah! Tonight's ladies' night
and we all get in for free!
Well, most of us.
Trust me.
You'll never get Bianca to dance
with you looking like this.
What is that?
- What?
- Nothing.
You just look good.
- Really?
- Yeah.
OK. Thanks.
- No, she's not going...
- No, she's not going to do...
Yeah, she is.
Wow!
That is so good.
That's $8.95.
What?
Aren't you just going to
take it out of your tip jar?
- $8.95.
- I got that.
I'll take two banana daiquiris,
one mango, a sloe gin fizz,
one slippery nipple, and for me,
a screaming orgasm on the beach
with extra sugar on the rim.
Better make that
last one a brewski.
Double brewski.
They didn't even card me.
It's just like Cabo.
How does a butt-plug like that
get all those hot chicks?
I got dibs on the dots.
Goddamn!
Ooh, he's cute!
Check out the sweet buns
on that guy.
I'd like to get my hands
on those and...
Wish they were
women's breasts and...
squeeze the hell out of 'em.
Maybe put a steak on 'em.
Cos I'm a guy.
That's what guys like me
like to do.
But I don't need to
tell you that.
Bianca!
I'll show her.
This is my song.
Remember -
the scorpion on her back.
I'll find it.
Wha..?
- The tattoo!
- I don't see it.
Right hand, red.
Left hand, blue.
Eeeek!
It's not her.
Don't worry,
we'll figure this out.
You're a great dancer.
You're just noticing that now?
I got to hit the little girls'
room before I soak my panties.
By that I mean...
my girlfriend's panties.
Which I carry with me.
To pee in.
If I don't make it in time.
To the bathroom.
What?
You don't pee
in your girlfriend's panties?
What kind of gay club is this?
Hey, everybody,
check out this guy!
Not peeing
in his chick's panties.
Excuse me.
Do you have to be in here
for this?
Well, it's part of
my job description,
but if you one
of those shy guys,
why don't you try that
stall there?
- There's someone in there.
- They'll be there a long time.
I told them to stay away
from the calamari.
Some folks think they can eat
anything that crawls.
Would you mind?
Excuse me?
Why is there ice in there?
I wouldn't have done that.
You're good at that.
You make it look so easy.
Why don't you just
take a picture?
All right.
Here goes. Disgusting!
Wrinkly. Gross!
I've never done this before.
It's going all over.
It's always good
to aim at something.
Like that cigarette there
or the big mint.
It's going everywhere!
You got to hold onto it.
Not too tight, but enough
to let it know you the boss.
See that fly?
Aim for him.
- That's helping.
- That's it.
Remember,
if you shake it more than twice,
you're playing with it.
I don't know how I could
ever thank you.
- Hi.
- That was an experience.
Here's your drink.
- Is there any ice in here?
- No.
Thank God.
Hey.
Aren't you that chick having sex
with that college guy?
- No.
- Want to be?
She's not interested, OK?
So why don't you just back off?
OK, grandpa.
What are you, their pimp?
And these are your skank hos?
You and me, right now.
Let's go.
Where are we going?
Come on, Jess.
What have you got, geezer?
Come on!
Show me what you got.
- What the...
- What's he doing?
Some kind of Tae Queer Do.
That really does hurt.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
Now go kick some ass.
You think you're so cool
cos you can pee with your penis.
Get a new conditioner.
Your ends are totally split.
- April, I don't know.
- Oh, come on.
This is the only way
you can be in school.
Here comes Jake.
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.
Skiing sucked.
I mean, you didn't miss a thing.
It was all mushed out.
Oh!
- What's with the scarf?
- It's kind of chilly in here.
Ski rash.
So I'm going to... Better...
I'm going to class.
So... All right.
April, I am so sorry.
He didn't even ask me
to the prom.
Jake and I are so over.
OK.
Now you get in there.
And remember,
your name is Spence.
I must tell you... Spence,
there are applicants who have
janitorial experience.
Your hair! It has such bounce.
Oh, it's this new cream ri-...
Anyway, as I was saying, you
haven't provided me with...
Look.
I'll be honest with you.
I'm a struggling musician.
Ever since my days playing the
tuba in the high school band...
You...
- You play the tuba?
- Yes.
In the honour band.
Well, Spence, I'd be going out
on a limb here, but...
You won't regret it, I promise.
Thank you, Ms Bernard.
Please. Call me Marjorie!
Marjorie.
Now, if you'll just fill out the
security portion of the form...
All right.
Billy?
- We need to talk.
- About what?!
- I called you on your ski trip.
- That was you?
Yeah.
I can explain.
Billy, wait!
I got to do what?
Hi, there. I missed you.
Hi, Sam.
Hey, Taquito! Think fast.
- You got me, señor.
- Pick up that ball.
You and me are going to
shoot some hoops.
Take that shit back to Tijuana!
Let me make you
feel more at home.
How are things
with the missus, señor?
Still not getting any.
When was the last time
you kissed her?
You mean, kiss her or...
kiss her kiss her?
Señor, sometimes
when a woman is ignoring you,
that's when
she wants you the most.
She's only waiting for you
to open up her passion,
which is like a...
waterfall waiting to explode.
You must get lots of enchilada,
Taquito.
Come on! Bring it!
- Tres points, señor?
- Lucky shot.
My outs again, señor?
How did you know I don't move
so well to my right?
Booger!
Have you seen your sister?
I haven't talked to her in days.
She was here a minute ago.
You just missed her.
Oh.
Good game.
Señor Richie?
I need to tell you something.
- But I can't.
- What you got going on?
I'm not really a gardener.
I agree with that.
The roses look like shit.
- I'm sorry.
- Easy there, big fella.
They're just roses.
I wanted to tell you...
I think you're the greatest dad
in the world.
Any kid would be lucky
to have you as their father.
Thanks, Taquito.
I'd hate to see you
after you lose a game.
- OK, did you eat any wolfsbane?
- No.
Any sex with a leprechaun?
Not recently.
Oh, my God.
They should come with a warning:
earrings may come with penis.
This be some serious shit.
Those belong to Princess Nawa.
There is a myth of her
using the earrings
to escape a bad marriage.
But she didn't know she had to
bring the earrings back together
and she lived out her life
as a slave girl.
Now it appears that this myth
is anything but.
Would you stop with
the damn drumming?
Oh, I'm sorry. I just was really
getting into your story.
You've got to find
that other earring
and unite them
before the full-moon end.
I got you, babe. Don't worry.
Ling-Ling!
Ling-Ling, look! I help.
I help you.
Hey, Billy!
Yeah-ha!
Is he OK?
What's the matter? Afraid the
janitor'll see your ding-dong?
What's up with you
and the prom queen?
I don't know.
I thought everything was fine,
but I guess I was wrong.
That's why you got to
have a spare, man.
That's what April is.
She's my spare.
- Spare?
- Yeah, she's my backup.
She was a fun ride, but she's
a previously owned vehicle.
- I'm into that new car smell.
- You asshole!
Whoever left these towels
over here is an asshole.
Now, this new chick I got...
Dude, she is going to be
the hottest chick at the prom.
I bet one of her friends'd love
to go out with the quarterback.
- I don't know, man.
- Come on, man.
Maybe this one'll put out,
unlike that cold fish Jessica.
You go to hell!
Whoever left these showers on.
Go to... hell.
Hey.
Jessica's anything
but a cold fish, all right?
She's the most amazing girl
in the whole world.
Dude, you've never even
been out of California.
I don't care. I love her.
I know she thinks
I only want to have sex,
but that's not what it's about.
I mean,
when that moment comes...
I want it to be perfect.
Wow.
That is the gayest thing
I have ever heard.
She's the only girl that makes
my heart beat faster and slower
at the same time.
When I'm not with her...
I'm not living.
I'm only existing until I can
hold her in my arms again.
Gay, gay, gay, gay.
Somebody shit in the locker.
Can I help you find something?
I was looking for my earring.
It accidentally fell
into the lawn mower
and... ricocheted
into the window.
I've always liked earrings
on men. Would you like...
some lemonade?
Here you go, Taquito.
It's got a Mexican
flavour to it.
What the hell is that?
A quesadilla and spicy menudo
with jalapeños.
Your national dish.
I'm sorry.
It's been so long
since I heard you laugh.
I mean,
since I started working here.
I am so sorry.
No problemo.
No problemo.
Carol! Please!
This would be really unnatural
in at least five different ways.
So...
You like men?
Of course I do.
What do you think?
Oh...
Oh.
Carol...
You are a beautiful
and very desirable woman.
And you have a husband
who's dying to be with you.
- He said that?
- Yes.
I cleaned up the language a bit,
but... yes!
I know.
Let's go paint your toenails.
Then we'll wash your hair.
My daughter Jessie
used to do those things for me.
I'll make up for that right now.
Come on.
Let's show that man of yours
what he's been missing.
Come on.
To the left. Right.
Oh, yes!
I love that. Oh, yes!
Carol!
How could you? In my own house?
- Señor...
- And you, Taquito!
We were supposed to be amigos!
The loofah for the scrubbing.
- Get out!
- Señor, is for the bath.
- I was...
- Shut uppo!
- I was scrubbing.
- Out!
Richie, Richie!
Really, it's not what you think.
It's my own fault.
Oh, Daddy!
Oh, Daddy!
Look at all these earrings.
- It's hopeless.
- I'm sorry.
The prom's in three days. Forget
about the cheer competition.
I had it all.
And I never really
appreciated it.
I took everybody for granted.
Oh, and today my dad walked in
on me and my mom in the tub.
I think I may have lost
my job as gardener.
You know, I'm kind of sorry
to say this, but...
this has been really fun.
Yeah, right.
Hey, babe, it's Jake. I got
a half-hour after wrestling.
I can either take a shower
or I can come on over.
Too late, dude.
She's with me right now.
She says that my pee-pee
is way bigger than yours.
And that's if I fold it in half.
No way!
Oh, my God!
That was awesome, Spence.
Any time.
You know,
I really thought I was in love.
How do you know for sure,
anyway?
I think it's
when you find someone
that you can really be
yourself with.
Share anything.
- You know?
- You mean, like best friends?
Yeah.
Love's when you can't even
imagine what life would be like
without that other person.
When words don't come close
to how your heart really feels.
And even though it doesn't
make sense to other people,
you know you're
meant to be together.
Yeah.
And you spend all night
thinking about him
and in the morning
you've never felt more rested.
It's like...
you have to grab onto something
cos it seems like your whole
body's about to float away.
OK.
- What?
- I have an idea.
What? What? What?
- It might sound kind of crazy.
- Tell me. What?
Why don't you and I
go to the prom together?
That would be awesome!
Yeah! So cool!
Yeah!
We'd make Jake so jealous.
Yeah!
I got to pee. I got to pee.
Oh, jeez!
- Sorry, I'll get that.
- Are you OK?
I'll get it.
Sorry.
Jessica?
Jessica!
Jessica! Oh, Jessica!
Oh, thank God.
I love you, baby.
- I would do anything for you.
- Yeah?
How much money you got?
- What?
- How much money you got?
About $40.
That your car?
It's my dad's. You know that.
Yeah. Cool.
Gimme the keys.
Thanks.
So...
What did you say your name was?
- Billy.
- Oh. Yeah.
Take it easy, Bobby.
It's Billy.
Where's Jessica?
Don't worry, Ms Bernard.
She'll be here.
Hey!
I really hope this works,
Jessica.
Come on. Let's go kick some ass.
OK.
Dude, there's Jessica.
- Whatever.
- Dude!
She does love me.
The bees are coming!
The bees are coming!
Sting this!
That's you! I see you.
Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen,
it appears the gentleman in the
bee outfit with the fake boobs
is the school janitor.
As per section 31-C
of the rule book,
school employees
are allowed to be mascots.
Say hello to your new champions:
the Bridgetown Honeys!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Here's a bizarre story.
Police are now searching for
the Hot Chick Bandit,
a beautiful young woman who
lures men into dark alleyways,
beats them senseless
and takes their wallets.
- We thought she needed help.
- Yeah, we're helpful guys.
So we went into the alley and
then she starts whaling on me.
Let me tell you,
she didn't hit like a girl.
Luckily Fitzi,
the good guy that he is,
was hiding behind a dumpster
with a video camera.
Looks like she worked
you over pretty good.
Yeah, well.
Don't get me wrong,
I got some shots in.
Why? Oh, God!
Oh, God, that hurt.
Why did you...
Hi, it's April.
Leave me a message.
It's Hildenberg.
I think I found Jessica's body.
It's in an alley outside a bar.
But we got to move fast.
The police are looking for her.
Call me back.
Jessica?
Not now, Booger.
I knew it! Jessie, it is you!
How come you didn't
snitch on me?
Cos you're my sister and I
accept you for who you are.
Come here.
You are such a little weirdo.
Sweet as candy!
Ling-Ling!
L to the I to the N to the G.
Ling-Ling,
you forgot your bling-bling.
Mom, you're ruining my life!
I just want to meet you halfway.
Nigga, prease.
I wish my mama
got me some bling-bling.
Honey, if you don't want her
as your mama, I'll take her.
Girl, please.
You still think I have
a chance of prom queen?
- No.
- OK.
Mom.
I'm sorry.
But why do you keep embarrassing
me in front of my friends?
You're not ashamed of me.
You're really
ashamed of yourself.
Tell Lulu -
easy on the chronic.
Oh.
Hi, Carol.
Jessica didn't get ready here.
No.
No, she hasn't been here
all week.
Oh, I knew it!
Something is going on
with Jessica and April.
I'm going to get to
the bottom of it.
If you ruin April's night,
I will have you put away.
If you're not going to help me,
I'm going to do it myself.
I think this is a good spot.
Jake's going to come
right by here.
I don't really care
about Jake any more.
You shouldn't. He's a jerk.
There's no one I'd rather
be with here tonight.
Me either.
April, you look
so beautiful tonight.
No one has been there
for me like you have.
You've always been there for me.
Any guy would be so lucky
to have you as their girlfriend.
And I should know. I've been
a guy for almost a week now.
And in that time you have been
such a good friend to me.
I don't know how
I could ever thank you.
Here he comes.
That dress looks great.
Is it easy to get out of?
God!
I am so lesbian right now.
We totally nailed him!
Jake is so jealous!
He spilt his drink all over his
date. You should have seen it!
We already got him, honey.
He can't see us any mo-...
Spence, I love you.
I love you too.
If you weren't holding on
to me right now...
I'd float away.
You're my best friend
and now you're a guy.
It's meant to be.
April...
You don't need me or any guy
to make you feel
beautiful and special.
Because you are.
You are the greatest girl
in the whole world.
You are all you need.
I know it's crazy,
but I can't help it.
I'm in love with you, Spence.
April.
- Are you going to be OK?
- I'm sorry.
Don't be.
We're not going to let
a little thing like
me turning into a man
and you wanting to be with me
get in the way of our
friendship, are we?
I'm in love with Billy.
And if I'm going to be
stuck like this forever,
he's just going to have to
accept me as I am.
A man.
That's my man.
I think I know
who's in Jessica's body.
And I know
where we can find him.
Let's find Jessica
and get out of here.
Hildenberg, you know what to do.
- Come on.
- That's a huge bitch.
I didn't see it coming.
No way, man.
- Scoot. He's mine.
- Boy, I don't think so.
- Get away!
- Billy...
It's me, Jessica.
It's always been me.
Mister, you're freaking me out.
You know -
and when I touch you there,
it makes your whole leg tingle.
And when I touch you here...
No! No, it can't be.
Do you remember
after the homecoming game,
after you threw the winning pass
to beat Carlmont,
you and I went behind
the scoreboard and...
You got to believe me.
Silly-Billy-Nilly.
Just close your eyes
and you'll know it's me.
I can't! I can't do it!
You said you'd love me
no matter what.
But... I mean...
you're a 30-year-old dude!
Just on the outside!
Billy!
Billy...
We found your body.
- Are you sure she's all right?
- I'm sure.
- Booger, hurry up!
- Come on, buddy.
You got to learn to run in those
if you're going to wear them.
There you go, sweetheart!
Oh, shit!
I knew it was going to be
a good night.
- God!
- Thanks, Hildenberg.
- I want my body back right now.
- Finders keepers, sweetheart.
How dare you! Do you know what
this could do to my lungs?
Gimme that earring!
Gimme that earring.
Give it to me.
Give it. Give it to me.
OK. OK.
Sit down! Calm down!
Calm down.
I'll make you a deal. OK?
Now...
Just let me make
another 500 bucks tonight, OK?
Then I'll give your body back
cos it's so important to you.
I'm crying about my body.
And then you can just loan it
to me every other weekend
so I can pay off
some gambling debts.
Weekends? Loan you my body?
I want my body back!
Give me my body back!
Hey.
Look at me.
I'm only going to
tell you this once.
No strangling the dancers
or you are out of here!
Now, can't you read?
Now this is more like it.
I got to hit the head.
Hey, don't worry.
We're going to get him.
Hey, baby!
Sweetheart!
Hey!
No way!
Jessica?
This is where you've been?
I want a dance from you. Yeah!
So dancing naked
must be fun, huh?
Yeah, sure. Why wouldn't it be?
Where do you
keep your weed, though?
That's good.
I don't have one of those.
Sure.
Bye, Spence.
You'll always be my best friend.
Forever.
- Billy?
- Hi, Mrs Spencer.
Mr Spencer.
How's it going, Booger?
This isn't the prom. Oh, my God!
- Anything yet?
- No.
Come on. Shake it!
You a naughty little honeybee.
Yes, you are!
- Anything yet?
- No.
I'm all right. I'm...
Hey, buddy,
how about a lap dance?
Hey, can't you read?
Monday night's gay night.
What?
It's me?
Really?
It is! It really is!
Taquito?
It's really you.
Billy.
Listen. I...
- I am so sorr-...
- Doesn't matter.
Nothing matters.
I don't care about the other
girl I took to the prom.
I don't care what Jake thinks.
I don't care
that you took my money,
stole my dad's car and tried to
run me down with it.
- No, I...
- No, none of that matters.
I'll even try to get over your
new job as an exotic dancer.
Billy...
Do you feel that?
You are the only boy who makes
my heart beat faster and slower
at the same time.
I'm not pressing charges.
You better get back on stage,
little lady.
The only place this little lady
is going is home
with me and my wife.
What kind of a place
do you think I'm running?
Class valedictorian -
Keecia "Ling-Ling" Jackson.
First, I'd like to say I'm very
proud to be half-Korean.
Thank you, honey!
But don't forget,
you also one quarter Jewish!
- Mazel tov, baby!
- Shalom!
Wait!
Please.
Thanks.
Hey, how's it going?
Thanks for helping me out, man.
You're a good man, a good guy.
Action!
OK, let's think.
What could have caused this?
No clue.
I mean, my house is built on an
old Indian burial ground. Sorry.
Start again.
OK, let's think.
What could have caused this?
Sorry.
OK, let's think.
What could have caused this?
No clue.
One more time.
What could have caused this?
OK. One more time.
OK, let's think.
What could have caused this?
OK.
OK, one more time. I'm ready.
OK, I'll get it.
Let me just do it.
I've got cheerleading practice,
the prom...
- Hang on.
- Action!
No clue.
All right, cut!
Action!
No clue.
I mean, my house is built on
an old Indian burial ground.
But find a... Sorry!
Sorry.
Here we go.
Sorry.
- Action!
- No clue.
I mean... Sorry!
I'll get through it. Here we go.
- I'm sorry.
- We have to reload.
Cut!
Are you saying...
people think I'm perfect?
Are you saying...
people think I'm perfect?
Do one more of those.
Sorry.
Are you saying...
people think I'm perfect?
- One less crazy.
- OK.
OK.
- You think we got it?
- I think we got it.
