####[Chorus]
You know who would be
Perfect to direct this...
and it kills me to say it,
because I don't relish
the idea of working with him...
- but... my ex-husband.
- Val?
Val's Perfect.
He's Perfect,
given this material.
She's right.
This is his kinda story.
Look, I love Val. I love him.
But with all due resPect...
- he's a raving,
incomPetent Psychotic.
- He's not incomPetent.
They should lock him uP
and throw away the key.
Don't take that the wrong way.
Forget it. We're gonna wind uP
$20 million over budget,
and maybe no Picture to boot.
That's right. I did
a Picture with him
when I was at Firestone.
- He didn't even finish the movie.
- I was there at Firestone.
- He had a nervous breakdown.
- He was under a lot of stress.
We had just broken uP...
Honey, he was fired off
a Picture here at Galaxie
just before I took over.
- They said his demands
were outrageous.
- He's a Perfectionist.
- The light had to be Perfect.
The sun had to be just right.
- [Scoffs]
He demanded that they
rePlace the leading lady.
He wanted to reshoot
the dailies every other day.
He fired the cameraman.
Finally, he came down
with shingles.
They shut down the Picture
and found another director
to finish it...
You-You don't have to tell me
about that. I was
married to him at the time.
- You should remember.
- That was ten years ago, Hal.
His best Pictures
were ten years ago.
Then he became a real artiste.
Look, look.
I am the last Person
to defend that craziness...
because it drove me nuts.
But Val cares about movies,
and he was born
to do this material.
- [All Protesting]
- Ellie, what are we
discussing here?
- Shingles, headaches.
Why oPen a can of worms?
- But he's mellowed.
I'm telling you.
Who better to direct this?
- The streets of New York
are in his marrow.
- Let me just say this: Ruth.
- Yes, Ruth.
- No way! God!
What about him? He's great.
I know we could get him.
He'd be safe.
We can Put our foot
on his neck. Martin Ruth.
That's true. Val hasn't worked
in a lot of years.
We could make a good deal.
- All you have to do
is watch him like a hawk.
- We're gonna lose...
We're gonna lose
a lot more with Val.
I agree with Ellie.
I think he's the ideal director
for this Project.
- But we're not gonna use him.
Who needs trouble?
- Right.
Besides, what makes you think
he'd want to work with us,
given all the Personal baggage?
I'm told that he's
in no Position to be fussy.
- [Wind Howling]
- I can't stand it here.
What the hell am I doing
in Canada?
Lori,
they got moose uP here.
Moose. Are moose carnivorous?
My God!
How could you be homesick?
You got there yesterday.
You're coming home tomorrow.
Val? Val, Val, Val.
We're good to go here.
Waiting on you.
Did my agent call?
Any word on that TV movie?
The interracial abortion,
gene-sPlicing thing?
I think the TV movie
decided to go
with Peter Bogdanovich.
Oh, th-th-that's great.
Th-Th-That's just great.
You know, l-I love Peter.
Peter's a beautiful guy.
- [Stammering]
God bless him. l, uh...
- Val!
Val, the client wants
more overhead coverage
of the sPray cans.
One minute.
Lori, this is humiliating.
l-I'm uP here shooting
a deodorant commercial.
I got two Oscars.
UP here, you don't
need Oscars. You need antlers.
[Hal Chuckles]
Here's a funny script about two
kids in a college fraternity...
who invent a machine
that can turn women
back into virgins again.
It's very clever.
What's the matter?
You know, when you asked me
to come out here for you,
you Promised me...
that I wasn't just going
to be one of those bright women
who-who finds ProPerties...
and goes to lunch 500 times
develoPing them,
and then never gets one made.
Honey,
The City That Never Sleeps
is green-lit.
- That's been your Project
from day one.
- Yeah, sure.
Until I suggest the director.
And then even though you admit
he'd be Perfect for it...
- I get shot down.
- You didn't get shot down, honey.
I know that
that's a risky choice,
but it's an insPired choice.
I think you're
trying to helP him
because you feel guilty.
Guilty? Why should
I feel guilty? Because
I fell in love with you?
I mean, God knows
I Put enough years
in that marriage.
- That's right. You did
absolutely nothing wrong.
- I know.
I brought uP his name
because... [Sighs]
because he would give you
the best movie
for that scriPt.
- Nobody argued that.
- He's Probably so angry
he won't even sPeak to you.
And he's liable
to ruin the Picture
just to get even with me.
No. You're wrong about that.
I'm telling you, you're wrong.
He would be grateful.
- He needs a comeback, and...
- Ellie, this is a very, very
exPensive film.
It's got solid
box-office Potential.
He can do it.
You don't regret
leaving him, do you?
You know, one day
you look uP and you realize
that laughs are not enough.
I can handle him, Hal.
I just got tired
of having to all the time.
And then, you know...
then I met you.
[Both Laugh]
- What are you doing home?
- [Sighs] I quit.
[GasPs]
No! Val,
not again.
- You quit over nothing again?
- Not over nothing.
- What?
- I quit over a big thing.
- What?
- They fired me. That was
big enough to quit over.
Oh, Val!
That's just great.
I got the last Plane
out of Toronto.
Have you ever seen Canada?
Now I know why
there's no crime uP there.
[Grunts]
Boy, I must say...
you don't seem
too enthused over seeing me.
Well, can you blame me?
What are you gonna do now?
You're gonna sit around
the aPartment, talking about
the good old days.
[Groans]
I gotta get a Picture.
Boy, somebody's got
to take a chance on me.
This is ridiculous.
When you're cold,
you're cold.
Fortunately, my business manager
Put away enough money
before he went to Prison...
- so I could hold out
another three weeks, maybe.
- Your agent called.
Hey, you know, if you'd
come uP there with me,
it might have been different.
Two PeoPle
in that sleePing bag
is a lot cozier than one.
And who goes on for me
in the Play?
[ExasPerated Sigh]
For God sakes,
it's an off-off-Broadway Play.
You're in the last stages.
Your understudy could have
gone on for you.
Are you kidding? My understudy?
Right, and that will be
the one night...
that Steven SPielberg
comes to see the Play,
or Harvey Weinstein.
They're not coming, believe me.
They're fasting.
[Sighs]
I would've been so good
in that ShakesPeare movie.
- [Groans]
- What's... Oh!
What's that?
These are Pelts.
l-I traded with
a fur traPPer between shots...
so the triP wouldn't be
a total loss.
- Your agent sent over that scriPt.
- A scriPt?
Why didn't you tell me
about this?
"The City That Never Sleeps."
When did this come in?
Well?
What did you think of it?
You know, I thought
it had definite Potential.
It's got a,
you know, really good
Manhattan feel to it.
You know, they're interested
in you directing.
You know,
that's fine with me.
You know,
this is the kind of material
that I can really do great.
This is... This is...
You know, I can
make this scriPt sing.
This is New York.
It's nightclubs.
It's the skyline.
- You want some water?
I'm very excited.
- Please. Me too.
- Who wants me?
- Well, uh, we have
a little selling to do...
but, uh,
Galaxie is making it.
- Hal Yeager?
- Yes, that's right.
- He stole my wife.
- Ellie is the one
who's Pushing for you.
Pass. I'm not gonna work
with Hal Yeager and Ellie.
You gotta be kidding.
He's a Philistine
and she's a quisling.
- It's a religious conflict.
- Will you calm down.
It's everything
you've been looking for.
l... You know,
I'm frankly flabbergasted
they would even think of me.
Well, they didn't
think of you. She did.
And she has convinced Yeager
to come fly to New York
and take a meeting with you.
- This guy stole my wife.
- He doesn't hold that
against you. It's business.
Can you believe that
she would leave me
for-for Hal Yeager?
I still can't get
my mind around it.
Mr. Slick...
- The Price of his haircut
could feed a family of five.
- Calm down.
You're getting all red.
Would you calm down.
And you're telling me she...
he doesn't want me? She's the...
The nerve of them.
He's such a manicured Phony.
May he... May he fall
on his blow comb...
and get hot
in the wrong Place.
Please, Val. Please don't
do anything to kill this.
It's a golden oPPortunity.
Forget it. I would rather do
the geriatric diaPer commercial
I turned down.
Would you? Because that's
what the future holds
if this falls through.
Of course I wouldn't.
This is a terrific script.
- l, you know... l...
- Make some sense now.
A $60 million dollar,
first-class feature film.
A big Payday, which you need.
And if you score with
this one, you're back on toP.
You'll never have
a gift like this
droP in your laP again.
Just take the meeting
with Yeager.
- And Ellie?
- Yes, and Ellie.
I'm telling you,
I'll get you half
a million dollars.
A lousy half-mil
they're offering?
They want to buy Prestige
at the Shrine Auditorium
Oscar night for a half-mil?
There's no offer.
It's not an offer yet.
- I reject their offer.
- There is nothing to reject.
- Well, I reject it anyhow.
- [Laughs]
You better meet with him
and you better be nice,
or else I'm out of here.
I finally get an offer
that's worthy of my gifts,
and look where it comes from.
There is no offer yet.
And I am so tired
of all this...
The big talk about how big
you were ten years ago.
Things change,
and you can't get work.
- You know, Part of me
wants it so badly.
- And the other Part?
Also wants it.
That's the Problem.
- It only takes one hit.
- I know.
- And I want a role in this movie.
- I don't have the movie yet.
He's gotta meet me
and throw his weight
around first.
And not just a little bit.
Something where I can show off
what I can do.
Lori, I can't stick
my girlfriend in the movie.
I'm not just your girlfriend.
I'm good.
Remember all those times
I told you you should
take acting lessons?
I'm a natural.
Classes would ruin me.
Jesus. You know,
Ellie feels guilty
about dumPing me...
so this is her way
of clearing her conscience.
Great!
What's the difference
how it came about?
This whole thing
is creePy, Lori.
For God sakes, this is a woman
I was married to for 10 years.
We made love. I'd hold
her head over the toilet bowl
when she threw uP.
- From making love with you?
- Not from making love with me.
From eating sushi.
For God's sakes,
I used to hug her when
she was afraid of flying.
And-And, you know,
I kissed her
on toP of the Eiffel Tower.
I swam in the moonlight
with her at Montauk.
Now suddenly I got
to take a meeting with her?
I don't know.
I've got very mixed feelings.
This guy has really
got to show me he's changed.
He's not in a Position
to make extraordinary demands.
Because it was over for him
years ago. He hasn't touched
anything for years... garbage.
I'm telling you, garbage.
I mean, I'm not saying that
as criticism, you know.
The question is, do I wanna
let this has-been make his
comeback Picture on my money?
- He's not a has-been.
He's a very good director...
- [Scoffs]
- who's fallen on
some difficulty times.
- He brought it on himself.
He's his own worst enemy.
Look, think of
the Press angle, you know.
Val Waxman does
his comeback film
for Galaxie Pictures.
What good is the Press
if the guy ruins the Picture?
He's not gonna
ruin the Picture.
No, you're damn right
he's not because
I'll fire him.
I'm not going to take
temPeramental antics
from some "owteur" genius.
- Auteur.Auteur.
- Whatever.
Okay, auteur.
You're doing a jack story,
okay?
He can do this film
better than anybody
I can think of.
Ha! We'll see.
- You're so nervous.
You're making me nervous.
- I'm not nervous. I'm tense.
- You are nervous.
- I'm tense. When I'm nervous,
I bite my nails.
When I'm tense,
I do this with my collar.
-Just act... Calm down
and act Professional.
- I am. I'm fine.
But this is a guy
who stole my wife.
Years ago,
I would never have consented
to make a film for him...
and now... now suddenly
I'm auditioning for him?
It's crazy. You know,
I would kill for this job...
but the PeoPle I want to kill
are the PeoPle who are
offering me the job.
- It's just insanity.
- What is that?
- Remember in the cab
I took a blue Pill?
- Yeah?
Well, that was
to calm my anger.
But it had sPeed in it.
So then I took
another Pill after that
to calm down the sPeed.
Well, this gets me back uP
to sPeed, where I want to be
actually for the meeting.
- Great. Perfect.
- Yeah.
Then that other Pill
I took keePs me dry
when it's raining out.
- Ellie. Ellie.
- [Exhales]
Hello, Al.
- So good to see you.
- Hello, Val.
Hello, Val.
- Al. How are you?
Good to see you.
- Ed.
[Introductions Continue]
I'm so glad you could get here.
Are they still having
Power failures?
I read that there was
a terrible Power failure
in California.
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Coffee would be wonderful.
Electricity.
That the electricity
was going off.
Come on in.
- Since when
do you wear suits?
- You have any milk?
- You never wore suits.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, cream.
Well, Val,
you look very good.
I'm okay, you know.
I've been having
some back sPasms...
and I have
a torn rotator cuff,
and-and, my knee...
You know, I got a hearing loss.
It's the oddest thing.
In my left ear...
- What did you think
of the scriPt?
- The script?
You know, the movie
that it's based on
was a stuPid little Potboiler.
He's asking about
the scriPt.
- But the rewrite is good.
- Thanks to Ellie.
She did all the work.
Yeah, it's good.
You know, I think this
could make...
a kind of tough, gritty,
New York, big city movie.
You can't make any money
just in big cities.
Well, I mean,
where do you think
this is going to Play?
It's not going to aPPeal
to farmers or shoPPing malls
in Biloxi.
Oh, I completely disagree.
I think if this picture
is mounted properly...
it's gonna have
universal aPPeal.
Where do you think
the demograPhics are?
The-The demograPhics?
You mean why the country
got so stuPid suddenly?
- My theory's fast foods.
- [Chuckles]
The age grouP.
The age grouP of this film.
Where do you see it?
The age?
This will aPPeal to,
you know... to, uh...
[Coughs]
adults and teenagers,
young adults...
and,you know, kids,
adolescents, I think.
Toddlers, I imagine.
Newborns.
Our marketing research
shows this film has
wide aPPeal for both sexes.
Yes, I agree
and then some, actually.
- But, the scriPt has
some holes in it.
- Val...
Like what?
Well, take the climax,
for instance.
I think the climax comes...
comes too early
is the Problem.
- It should come
after the trial scene.
- Didn't I say that?
The inciting event
should come later.
The character of Benny.
I feel we should shoot Benny...
with a hand-held camera
and not a Steadicam.
But it should be nervous.
It should, you know...
Put the audience ill at ease,
like his inner-Personality.
I don't know
if I like that.
It could be with a Steadicam.
You even said that.
Let me ask you how
you'd feel about this,
and be honest.
What if we shot
the whole Picture
in black and white?
- Why?
- Because New York City
is a black-and-white town.
- It reeks of
black and white.
- Forget it.
Arty. It's arty.
Does anybody have an asPirin?
Do you have an asPirin?
Here, try one of these.
My herbalist
gave them to me.
I can do this Picture.
I know... I got a feel for it.
- I see it all, maybe with like
a Cole Porter score?
- All right.
Let us discuss it.
We're talking to
a couPle of other directors
and, um, we'll let you know.
Maybe Irving Berlin
or something.
You bridge the...
Well, I think
we'd have to discuss it.
You know, if there ever was
a Val Waxman ProPerty,
boy, this is it, right?
- We'll keeP in touch.
- Does anyone have a Xanax?
- Zantac. I've got
an ulcer too.
- NotZantac, Xanax.
- It's a comPletely
different Problem.
- Can I talk to you?
[Indistinct]
Listen, Val... Oh, sorry.
It was great seeing you again.
It was.
- You've got an herbalist?
- Oh, yes. A genius.
In Beverly Hills he's a genius.
If he was in New York,
he'd be considered low-normal.
You know, we use
a comPletely different
rating system here.
When we were kids, there were
like ten foreign films a week
in this city.
- Italian, French...
- Oh, Italian films.
I love them.
Val Waxman.
Any messages?
You're sure?
Okay.
Did you see my cat?
Isn't that neat?
- Sorry about that.
Uh, no. Nothing.
- Anything?
- We were just talking
aboutAlfred Hitchcock.
- Mm-hmm.
- Truffaut said Notorious
was his best film.
- I agree. A masterPiece.
What are you talking about?
You hate... He hates that movie.
The ending makes you crazy.
Yes, because it's a masterPiece.
Every time I watch that movie...
when Cary Grant
is carrying Ingrid Bergman
down the staircase...
- I always think that the Germans
are going to catch them.
- I do too.
No matter how many times
I see it, I think the Germans
are gonna get them.
- Hitchcock was an artist,
but he was commercial.
- Yeah, that's right.
- You say that
like it's a good thing.
- You have to be both.
I mean, he knew
what he was doing.
In order to make movies...
you have to think
about the audience,
you have to...
Otherwise, you're just
making movies for yourself,
like artistic masturbation.
- That's right. That's right.
You're a narcissist.
- I'm a classic narcissist then.
Have I told you my views
on masturbation ever?
For me, the nicest thing
about masturbation
is afterward, the cuddling time.
- [All Laughing]
- They're laughing.
I'm not joking.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Want a wienie?
You got it. You're directing
The City That Never Sleeps.
I just got the call.
I can't believe it.
l... I can't sPeak.
I got you half a million,
Plus a tenth of a Point
after quadruPle break-even.
Listen, uh, they're
going back to L.A. tonight.
You think you could
meet Ellie for a drink
for ten minutes?
- Why?
- Why? Because you owe her
some thanks, that's why.
She went out on a limb for you.
I think she wants to make sure
you're both on the same Page.
Think about Hal Yeager.
He's quick to hire,
quick to fire.
You need Ellie
to run interference.
All right. All right.
I'll meet her at the-the...
Bemelmans Bar at 9:00.
I can sPare ten minutes.
l-I can't tell ya,
my head's swimming.
A tenth of a Point
after quadruPle break-even.
You are really a shark, Al.
####[Piano]
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Can I get a Beck's, Please?
Since we're working together,
I thought we should sit down
and talk for a few minutes.
[Coughs]
That's fine with me.
I mean, as you know, Hal was
a little skePtical at first...
but in the end, you know,
he's a businessman
and very Professional.
Let me set your mind at ease.
You don't have to worry
about everything.
Things are gonna go
very smoothly.
This is... This is
a big shot for me
and I realize that...
you know, many PeoPle
think that I'm...
that I can be difficult.
But you know I can be
very Professional...
and obviously, Hal Yeager's
very Professional...
and you're Professional,
clearly.
So, you know, as long as
business is business,
there should be no...
I cannot understand
how you could leave me
for that cheesy windbag.
It's mind-numbing to me.
I just don't understand that.
And you carry on with him
behind my back for two months.
- It was not two months.
- Yes. Yes, it was.
Don't tell me it wasn't.
You were carrying on behind
my back... Not even behind
my back, but under my nose.
- That's twice a day.
Both Places.
- Okay, you're exaggerating.
I'm not exaggerating.
You were always
on the Phone with him.
You were exchanging glances.
I noticed it. Then suddenly,
you were exchanging fluids.
l-I can't believe that
I didn't really see it.
You were too self-absorbed.
You were too intent on becoming
the greatAmerican film artist.
Don't tell me that. Everything
was fine with you until
I started to lose my audience.
Then suddenly you dumP me
and move out to Beverly Hills
with the swimming Pool.
You hated California.
We both hated it.
You hated traveling every Place
by car all the time.
And I hated traveling
by mud slide.
Well, what did you want
me to do? Our marriage
wasn't going anyPlace.
Where did you want it to go?
Where do marriages go?
After awhile they all lay there.
- That's the thing
about marriages.
- Look...
- You know, that's ridiculous.
- No, it was in trouble
for a long time.
You see, you don't see
what you don't want to see.
How was it in trouble?
We didn't...
We didn't communicate.
- We had sex.
- Yes, we had sex.
But we never talked.
Sex is better than talk.
Ask anybody in this bar.
- You can't...
- Talk is what you suffer through
so you can get to sex.
You isolate everything.
You can't just comPartmentalize
like that.
A good marriage consists
of many Parts well-integrated.
- Yes, and is one
of those Parts adultery?
- Never.
Absolutely. At the Plaza Hotel.
For God sakes, I got the bill.
You had the escargot
that afternoon.
I can't... It's so disgusting.
Sex and snails
with that roast beef
from Beverly Hills.
You were so busy Playing
the American artist.
That's what
you were doing, Playing.
You felt it was imPortant
to be uncomPromising
and temPeramental...
and difficult...
God, difficult!
To starve and to suffer.
I tell you, you had all
the symPtoms, not the disease.
You used to think
I was creative and original.
And I still do...
as a filmmaker.
It's when you became
creative as a hyPochondriac,
that was it.
- Hey, all those attacks
were for real.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.
- The Black Plague, Val?
An allergy to oxygen?
Elm blight?
Only trees get Elm blight...
Elm trees.
Can I sum it uP?
You cheated on me. You lied.
You dumPed me...
[Stammering]
Business. We're here
to discuss business.
- That's right.
- Can we discuss it?
- I wanna keeP this absolutely
on a Professional level.
- Absolutely.
I think that we should rework
the scriPt a little bit...
because I think
it doesn't have to be
middle-aged PeoPle.
We could make the character
of Kelly Swain, you know,
maybe coming out of college.
- That's true.
You mean out of law school?
- Law school, yeah.
I think they'd like that at
Galaxie. That way we could cast
somebody like Terry Tyler...
- Great.
- or maybe find... there's a
lot of talented kids out there.
You are such a shallow jerk!
I can't get my mind around it.
That you would leave me
for a guy who is the oPPosite
of everything I am.
You know, with his ski lodge
in AsPen and his collection
of vintage cars.
If I drove around in
a 1939 Mercedes, PeoPle
would think I was Himmler.
Hal's very smart, and he's
a brilliant deal maker.
Yes, I know.
He's been audited by the best.
He has made some Pretty
financially successful
American films.
That should tell you
all you need to know about him.
He's the white line
down the middle of the road.
You had your little flirtations
too. There was that-that
Italian model.
No. You were the only one
that I was serious with. My God.
Until you suddenly became
noncommunicative, nonresPonsive
and you dumPed me...
[Stammering]
The movie is going to be
a fun movie to do, I think.
Um, and I have a lot
of ideas that I think
we should discuss.
Good. Absolutely. I just
wanted to assure you that once
the studio agreed to you...
you'll have their
full suPPort and...
[Heavy Breathing]
Well, thank you very much.
I want a... I think I want
a foreign cameraman.
- That's no Problem.
- Because they get a texture
into the work...
that you would never get
with an American cameraman.
They have a certain mobility.
I remember coming home
and I Picked uP the extension...
and there you are
on the other end of
the extension with this guy.
I'm calling and I hear my wife
in a lovey-dovey with her lover,
saying she misses her lover.
- He wasn't my lover yet.
- Bull! He was your lover.
What are you telling me?
And I recognize the voice.
It's Hal Yeager
from Galaxie Pictures.
And I'm thinking to myself,
"Why is my wife talking
like that to Hal Yeager for?"
They're making me a surPrise
Party. I thought they were
making me a surPrise Party.
- Were they?
- No. She was having an affair
with Hal Yeager.
- Follow the story.
Jesus, I can't believe this...
- I'm getting out of here.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
We're discussing a movie.
- No, I'm sorry. I just...
- What about...
I'll be back and forth from L.A.
and I won't bother you...
and I'll see to it that nobody
gets in your way creatively.
- What about Denise Daniels
as the blackmailer?
- Possibly. If you like.
I think she would be great.
You know what I mean?
Or Sarah Bedloe.
She would be very interesting.
She... I Pick uP the Phone
and she's talking...
I'm going to order a corn beef
sandwich, she's talking to
her lover on the Phone.
- Look, I'll be back from L.A.
in two weeks...
- This is gonna be a fun Picture.
- It'll be great.
We're all very excited.
- I'm looking forward to it.
About Hal Yeager. The word
on him is cross-dresser.
Check it out for me.
I Pick the Phone uP
and she...
- Hal, we're off to
a really good start here.
- Tell me about it, honey.
Val wants to use
a foreign cameraman, which
I think we should give him.
He's got a real visual
concePt of where he wants
to go with this thing.
Um, now he's chosen Kow Chan,
a Chinese cameraman...
done some stunning work,
mostly with the Red Army.
[SPeaking Chinese]
He says he doesn't
like his hotel.
He much Prefer the Sherry.
Hal, listen. Val wants
to go with Elio Sebastian
as art director.
Val says that Elio
really knows the streets
of New York.
Every location in the scriPt
is out there
waiting to be found.
- This is great.
It saves us a fortune.
- With the excePtion of two:
Times Square and Harlem.
I have to build Times Square
and Harlem.
We can't build
Times Square and Harlem.
With all due resPect.
He wants to build
the EmPire State Building?
No.
-Just the first 20 stories.
- Absolutely not.
No, sweetheart.
It's not gonna haPPen, okay?
Just tell him no.
It's not gonna haPPen.
- All right, I'll handle it.
- Good. Great.
Hey, listen. I miss you.
How's the weather back there?
It's been great, you know?
It's been really New York-moody.
Very gray and cloudy.
- That's the way it is.
- Today's the first day
of sun we've had in awhile.
Well, listen,
here it's been fabulous.
Sunny and clear every day.
Oh, listen. I gotta run.
I'm having another
skin cancer removed.
[Val]
This is perfect.
This view is absolutely perfect.
No, no. I hate it.
I'm... we're just gonna
have to build it.
- Build Central Park?
- Yeah. You know, I take back
what I said before about...
- mixing real locations and sets...
- I don't wanna be
a money watchdog here...
but if you did
build everything...
I say this metaPhorically...
it'd have to be done
over my dead body...
metaPhorically.
All right,
if not the whole Park,
then just the reservoir.
- Build the reservoir?
- Uh-huh. You know what?
You get a studio...
Put a tank in it and fill it
with a couPle thousand
gallons of water... It'll work.
And then... Wait...
trees behind it, you know?
- New York as a symPhony in green.
- Green I hate. I never use green.
- No. No green.
- You know what?
Tell Mother Nature, okay?
- Trees are green.
- We can Play it for the winter.
You can use snow.
I buy that. A white background
to set off the two leads...
and marvelous '40s red.
- [In Chinese]
- What? What?
- What is he saying? What?
- [Continues]
He says no white.
No white. He cannot shoot
white background.
Sebastian, what have
you gotten me into here?
You know what?
I Prefer green myself.
Green and red.
[All Arguing]
All I'm saying is that
I think you're being
PreciPitous in firing him.
- Look, I never wanted
this guy. Not from day one.
- Hal...
I beg your entire Pardon.
May I just offer
for your consideration...
- a single concePt,
and I say this...
- You don't have to...
- Stand uP, you don't
have to lean into the sPeaker.
- Look, he's out.
I want this guy out
before this Picture
becomes a cost nightmare.
Look, Hal, I think that
maybe if we had a talk with him.
I said from the start
to use Harold PaPPas.
PaPPas is a hack. PaPPas
is safe, but he's uninsPired.
I can't work with him.
- Then you should bow out now.
- I said I can't work with him.
I didn't say I wouldn't.
Val, I don't mean to get hot
under the collar, but PaPPas
has how many nominations...
comPared to this
Greenwich Village lunatic?
They Probably sPent more money
getting those nominations...
- than he'll sPend
building a reservoir.
- I didn't get that.
- Nothing. Nothing, Hal.
- I gave in on
the Chinese cameraman.
I've kePt away from
your Picture. I'm saying I'd
feel more secure with PaPPas.
- A word to the wise.
- Is there anything about
the Part of Benny...
that you want to tell me
before I read it?
Only that he's
a Broadway sharpie,
a gambler.
- Like Sky Masterson?
- Perfect. Exactly.
Now, forgive me,
it might seem obvious,
but he's a Runyonesque...
bookmaker-tyPe, uh, is tough,
but softhearted with his wife
who he's nuts about?
That's it on the nose.
That would be Perfect.
[Takes Two DeeP Breaths]
Go.
Jerry, some guys were over
the house looking for you.
Seems you owe some money.
[Dramatic Voice]
I hoPe you didn't tell them
anything, Helen.
I could find myself
in deeP trouble.
- DeeP, deeP trouble.
- Thank you.
Hi.
[Nervous Giggle]
I'll wait for you.
If they give you 30 years,
I'll be waiting.
If they give you 50 years,
I'll be waiting.
If you get two
consecutive life sentences...
I'll be waiting.
[Clears Throat]
I thought that last girl was
kind of interesting. Did you?
- Really?
- I thought she read it
better than the others.
I know, but Claire's
suPPosed to be classy.
Didn't you think
she was a little
on the cheaP side?
- CheaP?
- To be Perfectly honest, I
thought she radiated stuPidity.
- StuPidity?
- I mean, her reading
was comPetent enough...
but, my God, it's like
her Persona...
it's trashy
and dumb.
Well, you know,
I think I'd like to use her.
She was interesting.
- You're the director.
- It's not that big a Part, Ellie.
But it's a featured role.
Claire's suPPosed to be
a socialite, for God sakes.
This girl, "Lori Fox,"
she's like a steP above
trailer Park.
- Well, I would hardly
call her trailer Park.
- I said a steP above.
Well, I'd like to use her.
I thought she was
Perfect for the role.
Fine. I mean,
it's your decision.
I'm just throwing out ideas.
You can take 'em
or leave 'em.
Two for Yeager, Please.
- They're clearing
your table, Mr. Yeager.
- Thank you.
I am so glad that
you could come in.
I really am.
I was here on business
and I wanted an excuse
to see you.
- I didn't want you
to think I was crowding you.
- I know you, you know.
You're checking uP on me.
Everything's going
really fine. It is.
- And Val?
- Val's Val. He seems
reasonably flexible.
- Most of his ideas
are really good. You'll see.
- I hoPe so.
- Right this way.
- Thank you.
- There are no Personal feelings
that make it seem awkward?
- No, no.
- I think he's accePted things
and moved on.
- Good. By the way...
Andrea Ford's going to be
covering the making of the film
for Esquire.
Oh, no kid... Hey, Val.
We were just
talking about you.
Hey, Val. Ellie was
telling me how well
things are going.
- [Stammering]
- How are you? Good to see you.
Everything all right?
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean,
"What am I doing..."
- No, what are you doing here
at this moment?
- We used to eat here.
- Hal came in on a Plane
a few hours ago.
- That's the best way to fly.
What are you doing
in this restaurant
at this moment?
What do you mean?
We're coming in to get a bite...
Are you all right?
[Ellie]
You're awfully fidgety
or something.
- What are you doing?
Are you okay?
- Yes, no, I'm fine.
I was just thinking
you should go to your table
because it's crowded here.
- I'm ready to go.
- It's the woman that was
at the audition today.
- [Giggling]
That's very funny.
- Hello, miss.
- Aren't you going
to introduce me?
- It's Lori Fox, isn't it?
- Yes, of course.
- I think it was.
Yes. Val is such a riot.
StoP kidding around.
I just... I really wanted
to Put your mind at ease...
that just because I'm the
director's significant other,
I can still act.
- Hi.
- [Man]
Hal?
- Hey, Mort. How are you?
I thought you were in AsPen.
- I wish.
- You know Ellie, my fiancée?
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm Lori Fox.
Nice to meet you.
- F-F-Fiancée?
- Congratulations.
When's the date?
- New Year's Eve.
My goodness, how romantic.
That's wonderful.
- Congratulations
on your new film.
- You know Val Waxman.
- Of course. Sure.
We sued him...
- Fiancée?
- for failure to comPlete a Picture.
- That makes me feel secure.
I'll see you
tomorrow, Val.
Hurry! I'll miss
my flight.
This is not a good time
for you to go away.
I'm very vulnerable.
If I'm gonna be
in this movie,
I have to get into shaPe.
This sPa is the only way
I'll ever have the disciPline.
- But you're not overweight.
- Oh, my God! I'm a horse.
- I have to aPPear in lingerie.
- What if we need you?
It's a ten-week shooting
schedule. My scene doesn't
come until the very end.
What if I need you?
I'm going through a bad time.
You'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
You're a big boy.
Oh, geez. You know,
I'm afraid to sleeP alone.
l-l-I keeP thinking
PeoPle are breaking in.
I lay awake all night...
thinking of death
and the blackness
and the abyss.
Oh, oh, don't forget
to water my cactus.
- Call me every day.
- I can't. They don't have
any Phones at Dolby Ranch.
They want to discourage
secret eating schemes.
- [Woman Over P.A., Indistinct]
- Oh! Oh! Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh. Okay,
I gotta go. Gotta go!
[Man]
And we want to see
the earrings. Profile.
Other profile, please.
And cut.
Thank you.
Is it true your cameraman
sPeaks only Chinese?
Yes, Mandarin.
It's so hard to find a good
Cantonese cameraman these days.
Neighborhoods just don't
have them anymore.
Hal Yeager's known
to be very hands-on,
very hot-temPered...
quick to rePlace PeoPle.
- Does that bother you?
- No, because the deal is...
they're going
to leave me alone
during the shooting.
- I have comPlete freedom.
- How about working
so closely with your ex-wife?
Well, it's not so close.
She'lljust be uP and back.
It's not going to be that close.
Well, there must be
some bitterness.
EsPecially now that she's
going to marry Hal Yeager,
the man she left you for...
who's now your boss?
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Andrea Ford.
I'm going to be doing
the story...
on the making of the movie
for Esquire.
- Oh, really. Are you?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Didn't they tell you?
I'm going to
be observing the whole time.
'Cause I don't usually like,
you know, when journalists
hang around the set...
- and observe when I work.
- Take that uP
with the Press dePartment.
But don't worry.
I won't get in your way.
I Promise. I am a huge fan.
- [Clears Throat]
Yes?
- Oh, huge.
I have loved
all of your movies.
Oh, well, you know...
And you'll be hanging around
doing a story here?
Yes. Because, in fact,
I've always thought of you
as a unique American artist.
Oh. Well, I'm sure
you won't be in the way here.
You know, there's Plenty
of room and you can have...
Val. Hey, gosh,
I'm so sorry.
Can I steal him for a minute?
- I really was about to...
- Some things we have
to go over.
I'll get him right back to you.
I'm so sorry. In one minute.
I'm so sorry.
- You need to be careful.
She is a killer.
- She's a killer?
I didn't think it was
a good idea having her around
all the time.
But then the Press dePartment
told Hal that they could get
the cover of Esquire and so...
- How is she a killer?
She loves me.
- Well, that's fine.
I mean, if she likes you,
you know. Otherwise,
she can be biting.
- Really?
- I hear she's all sugar
and sweetness...
and gets into
your good graces
and then wham!
She kePt telling Sean Madigan
how she loved all of his films
and she was a big fan.
How he was a great,
I don't know, unique
American artist.
- Really?
- And then in the Profile,
she disemboweled him.
You know, if you haPPen to fall
for that kind of flattery...
- I can handle it, though.
- Please. You couldn't handle
Shirley TemPle.
Give me a break,
will ya?
You know, I can't
figure it out.
It's okay to have an affair
with Hal Yeager, but...
you know, everyone is entitled
to have one Psychotic ePisode
in their lives, but...
- to marry the guy is...
- Honestly,
I wouldn't talk if I were you.
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
How long have you
been living with
that wind-uP doll I met?
You know I don't like
to sleeP alone. For God's sakes,
I'm not going to marry her.
And that wind-uP doll
haPPens to have a Ph.D.
In what?
History of gym?
Hey, look. Will you
give me a break
with the cutting remarks?
I got a Picture to do Tuesday.
I'm thinking about my work.
I want you to get some rest
this weekend, okay?
And don't lie around
the whole time worrying about
everything that could go wrong.
Don't worry.
I'm not going to lie around.
I've got my hand
on the wheel, honey.
This Picture's in the bank.
[Woman]
Amanda, honey, who is it?
- I don't know.
Uncle Al, it's for you.
- [All Groaning]
- Please, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- A man or woman?
- Hello?
- Al, you gotta get
over here right away.
Why? What's wrong?
I'm at my sister's for a Seder.
Al, you gotta get over here.
This is a matter
of life and death!
- [Knocking On Door]
- It's open. Come in!
- [Door Closes]
- What is it?
What's going on?
What am I doing here?
Al, I going to try
to exPlain this to you.
I came home, and I started
to make notes on
the scriPt, you know...
because we shoot Tuesday
and I wanted, you know...
then I started to get nervous.
So, I sat down on the sofa,
and I was doing
my deeP-breathing exercises...
just to stay calm,
you know?
And it was working,
and I started to relax,
and I dozed off.
Then I slePt for a while.
Then I woke uP, Al...
and... I can't see anything.
- What?
- I'm blind.
I'm blind, Al.
What?
I'm blind. I'm blind.
I can't see.
- What do you mean,
you can't see?
- What do I mean?
Those guys in the street
with the dark glasses
and accordions?
What are you talking about?
Are you trying?
Al, you can't try and see.
You look around and you see
or you don't see. I don't see.
- How can you be blind?
- Howthe hell do I know
how I can be blind?
- I'm... Al, I'm scared.
- What did you eat?
What's the difference
what I ate?
You-You-You can't
lose your vision
from a Plate of tofu.
- l-I never heard
of anything like this.
- Yes. I did.
- Remember the actor
Harvey Gates?
- Yeah?
- He lost his vision suddenly.
- From what?
- GraPefruit.
- Grapefruit?
Yes, he had a tumor
the size of a graPefruit
on his brain.
- And he went blind?
- Yes, he went blind...
and-and a few months later
he went dead...
which is worse than blind
'cause your oPtions decrease.
Relax. You don't have
a brain tumor.
Al, with all due respect...
I have to hear that
from somebody who went
to a greater medical school...
than the William Morris agency.
We'll get you to Dr. Mason.
You still use Mason, right?
No. Mason droPPed dead
on the treadmill. I use Koch.
You know, I use Koch too.
Did you bumP into anything?
Did you fall?
Did you bumP your head
or something?
I didn't bumP my head. Nothing!
Al, I got a brain tumor.
That's the story here.
l-l... The end is in sight.
I see the wall.
- I thought you said
you couldn't see.
- It's an exPression.
I don't actually mean
I see a wall.
It's in my mind's eye.
Listen. I remember that
Ellie and I took you
to the hosPital...
You insisted on taking you
to the hosPital because
you were convinced...
- you had
hoof-and-mouth disease.
- Oh, God. Ellie!
Look, if I die, Al,
tell Ellie I'm sorry
I said all those things to her.
I said terrible things to her.
I called her
all kinds of names.
- Probably because
I never stoPPed loving her.
- [Chuckling] You're not dying.
Well, if I don't die,
tell her she's a tramP
and she's living with a guy...
the best you could say
about him is sometimes
he returns Phone calls.
Oh, Dr. Koch.
It's Al Hack here.
I'm sorry to call you at home
on holiday, but I'm sitting
here with Val Waxman...
Okay,
you can sit back now.
- So-So, what is the story?
- Well, your oPtic nerve
is normal.
- Your eye exam is normal.
I don't see anything.
- Wonderful.
You don't see anything?
I don't see anything either.
That's the Problem.
Any tumor large enough
to imPact on his vision
so dramatically would show uP.
I only wish I was in
as good health as he is.
This is a textbook scenario.
Physically, you're 100 Percent.
But just like someone who
has an hysterical Paralysis...
a Patient who's fine
but he can't walk...
or a Patient who loses
his or her voice...
from witnessing a horrible shock
or any extreme,
stress-related trauma...
Being a film director,
your inner-conflicts...
have chosen to exPress
themselves in this
very telling fashion.
You're
Psychosomatically blind.
- How can I get rid of it?
- By treatment.
By understanding the roots
of your conflict...
- there's every chance that
this blindness will go away.
- How quickly?
Well, real growth
is always very slow.
- [Door Closes]
- There goes my comeback.
You cannot breathe
a word of this to anybody.
I gotta tell 'em, Al.
You know, I just dread
telling Ellie.
Are you nuts?
They'll fire you.
Fire me?
I obviously can't
direct the Picture.
What are you talking about?
How can you blow this shot?
What are you talking about?
I'm blind.
- Nobody knows.
- What the hell does that mean?
What are you suggesting?
If you Pull out
of this Project now
because Psychological stress...
has caused you
to lose your sight,
you'll never work again.
- They'll burn your union card.
- Maybe they could postpone it.
Oh, yeah,
because you're blind?
Val, direct this Picture
and bring in a hit...
or I leave you
with two words: homeless man.
- I can't direct...
How can l...
- I'm telling you how.
You're going
to muddle your way through
until your sight returns.
Al, I can't direct
a Picture. I'm blind.
Have you seen some
of the Pictures out there?
The first five minutes
they'll catch me.
Maybe they will,
maybe they won't.
If they do, you're no worse off
than if you confess...
because you're finished
in the business anyway.
You gotta be joking.
I'll take one steP on the set,
I'll break my neck.
No, no, no.
I'll come with you.
They won't let you.
The actors get nervous
when agents hang around.
It's against
Galaxie Policy.
Listen. Once you get
on the set, you get relaxed,
you won't even need me.
There's no way to do this.
I would have to take
somebody into my confidence.
Absolutely not.
No. Never. Not a hint.
This can't get out.
You will direct
a hit Picture.
Sometimes God works
in strange ways.
Like Job.
[Chattering]
[Andrea's Voice]
Notes on "Making of
The City That Never SleePs."
First morning atmosphere
is upbeat.
Lots of eager anticipation.
People moving lights.
Actors and actresses all ready
in costume and makeup.
Val Waxman is not
the first one on the set.
Actually, a few minutes late.
- This is never going to work.
- It's working Perfect.
Just stand straight.
- Am I going to bumP
into anything?
- No, no, no.
I'll guide you.
You don't trust me.
You have to trust me.
- I gotta look funny.
- You look Perfect.
I'm telling you.
- l-l-l...
- Look at this.
How wonderful. Nice.
Good morning.
Would you like anything?
Any coffee?
- Coffee. Want some coffee?
- Coffee. Yeah.
- No. No. No. I'm...
No thank you.
- Okay.
Well, the actors are here
if you're ready
to block the scene.
- Blo-Blo-Block the scene?
- Yes. We could...
Listen, Val. Are you okay
with the changes in the set?
- Oh, the set. It's beautiful.
- Oh. It's great.
How do you feel about
the background color?
You satisfied?
It's blue and, you know,
brown and yellow, but
is it a little dark?
Beg your Pardon,
who are you?
I'm Al Hack.
I'm his agent.
Al, can I sPeak
to you a second?
- Yeah, uh, I'll be right back.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
- Al?
- Yes, yes, yes?
- Not that you're not welcome
here. You know I love you.
- Yes, yes.
- But, you know,
this is a closed set.
Oh, well, you see,
he really needs me.
He likes me to be with him.
I know, but a man
of your stature... an agent...
-you know,
it intimidates PeoPle.
- Oh...
- You look so good.
Have you had any work done?
-Just over here.
A little? 'Cause l...
Who did you go to?
Not that I need it...
- Fred. Fred.
- but I'm thinking
about it.
Oh, he's incredible.
You got the best clients.
Can you get me a Price?
I think that we may be like
a little bit too light.
Would you Prefer that
I take the whole thing
one shade darker?
Eh, well, that's a...
that's a Possibility.
What do you think?
What would you do?
Well, I really don't know. It's
Possible I could make the whole
thing match the uPholstery.
That's another oPtion.
That's brilliant.
That's what I would do.
I would match the uPholstery.
Excuse me.
Chief, what alarm clock
would you like to go with?
- Uh, that one.
That one. That one.
- Which one?
- I'm sorry...
I'm sorry. Which-
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- You like the wind-uP
or the electric?
- Yes. The wind-uP. Wind-uP.
- I like the wind-uP.
- Val? Val? Excuse me.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Can I see you
just for a second?
Don't worry.
- Excuse me.
- Al, this is not working.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It's going to work fine.
But you're right.
It is a closed set,
and I have to leave.
- You...
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
Just go to Plan "B."
- What is Plan "B"?
We don't have a Plan "B."
- We gotta find somebody...
who you trust
who will helP you.
- Someone you can rely on.
- You mean,
tell someone the truth?
Yes. Somebody you can rely on.
We'll get somebody who's
around you all the time.
Who doesn't look odd,
you know? Maybe the A.D.?
What about the scriPt girl?
I can't do that.
They'll get in trouble.
If they get caught...
they'll never work
in the business again.
l-I have a resPonsibility, Al,
to Ellie and even to Hal.
You have a resPonsibility
to yourself!
You have agent's ethics.
I can't go by you.
Don't hit me with oxymorons
at this time.
We're in a crisis!
Wait a minute. Shh.
What about the Chinese kid?
- The translator?
- Yes, the translator.
The translator.
He's a business student
at NYU, right?
He doesn't care if he's in
the movie business. If he gets
caught, it's no big Penalty.
- Well, he is always around me.
It's a natural-natural...
- Yes, see?
Val, I've got the actors.
We are ready for you.
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I'll get you to the set.
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'll take you.
I'll take you.
It's gonna be fine.
If-lf I'm acting so crazy,
everyone'll notice
that I'm acting crazy.
Listen. You got
a rePutation for being crazy.
This is the Perfect time
for it to work in your favor.
Watch out. One steP. One steP.
Ah, very good.
Hey, can I have
Mr. Waxman's chair here?
- The director needs his chair.
Where is it?
- Chair?
Thank you very much.
Here, come sit.
Look, your lucky chair.
- Oh.
- Isn't that wonderful?
Sit, sit, sit. Be relaxed.
Real good.
Good luck.
- I can't work with
outside PeoPle watching me.
- Nobody's gonna be watching.
- Incidentally, you like
this one or this one?
- I like that one.
- This one?
'Cause this one's more like...
- Yes, that one.
what they'd really use,
but this one's more theatrical.
Well, you know, you can
use this one if you'd like.
But I Prefer that one.
- Which one?
The first or the second?
- This one.
- I'd like to make
my entrance from the stairs.
- [SPeaking Chinese]
[All Talking At Once]
Hold it. What... Who ordered?
Who ordered? What's haPPening?
- How do you want me
to kiss her?
- What's haPPening here?
- Which way did you want me
to kiss her?
- [Stammering]
- You know, on the...
on the mouth.
- What about my mouth?
- No, kiss her on the mouth.
- He hasn't seen here
for six years.
We originally discussed
some kind of Passionate way
of grabbing her.
Oh, well,
use both liPs.
Oh, excuse me.
Could I talk to you
just for a second?
- Me?
- Yeah, just for a minute.
- Uh, they need me.
- Well, actually, the director...
- The director asked me
to talk to you. Yes.
- Mr. Waxman?
[WhisPering]
It's a chance to make
some extra salary.
Now, you seem to be a very
resPonsible young man.
Are you?
- [Chinese]
- You should move left.
You got me doing two things
at once here. I can't work
if I don't know what you want.
- You should cross left.
- Wait. Me? You mean my left?
- If I cross my left, I'm going
to bumP right into him.
- You don't have to bumP me.
- I'm Probably going
to knock him over.
- Where is the translator?
- Excuse me.
He's suPPosed to be on set.
- [All Talking]
- Sir, I have a very imPortant
message for you.
- ImPortant message for me?
Um, I'm here to helP you.
I know about your secret.
Don't!
Cut!
Very good. That was terrific.
Was it very good?
Was it very good?
Well, I don't see
the dramatic imPact of it.
But it did seem a little
imProvement from
the random chaos...
-you were encouraging.
- Oh, thank you. You didn't
like the random chaos, huh?
Let's... Can we go again?
Just for safety, one more?
Okay, sir,
we're aPProaching
a hallway right now.
So we're
gonna walk slowly.
There's nobody here.
- Practically nobody.
- Okay.
- Be careful.
- I'm trying to be casual,
but it's extremely difficult.
- Oh, I know that...
- Ooh! Sorry.
Boss, you all right?
Yes. No, I'm fine.
It was my fault comPletely.
I forgive you.
Sir, he's gone.
He's not there anymore.
You're talking to air.
Why didn't you warn me?
I thought you saw him.
This is very weird for me.
You thought I saw him?
How am l...
- A few summers ago
I did aid a deaf uncle.
- You're going too fast.
Okay, slowly, slowly.
It's very weird.
I was helPing out
a deaf uncle
a few summers ago...
but we didn't have
to hide it like this.
Oh,Jesus, this is great.
Val, you wanna go
with this one tomorrow
or the big one?
Uh, well...
- Wow. These are beautiful
Pocket watches.
- Thanks.
I would go
with the big one.
Val, um, how'd you
feel the first day went?
The first day
was, you know, like the first day.
It was like a shakedown
where you weed out
the malcontents.
Oh, good. I'd love to sPeak
to you for a few minutes
if you're not too busy and all.
- l-l...
- Well, sir, uh...
you said you wanted me
to show me that, uh,
Piece of jade?
-Jade?
- You know what?
If you have work to do...
we'll do this
some other time.
- Yes, I do. l-l...
- Okay. Thank you.
Sorry, sir. That's
all I could think of
to extricate you.
You realize there's
no Piece of jade.
Yes, I get it.
I get it. There's no jade.
Hey,
everything okay?
So far our consPiracy
has gone undetected.
Perfect. I'm taking you
to your shrink right now.
Listen. Same drill
tomorrow, Chou.
Don't worry.
I'll Practice casual banter.
Very good. Good.
Nice to see you.
[Andrea's Voice]
To observe Val Waxman directing...
one would think he has
no idea what he's doing.
I wonder if he is one
of those cinema geniuses...
who thrive on chaos,
like Fellini.
He always seems distracted.
He never looks anyone
in the eye...
and must be juggling
a million things
in his mind at once.
It's easy to see
why his reputation
is one of an eccentric.
I notice, too,
as the weeks go by...
what a great interest
he has in the photography...
as he is always conferring
with the cameraman
through his translator.
How were they?
How were the dailies.
You forget, sir.
I'm not a film student,
hence, a Poor judge.
I study business,
and as an investment, sir,
I wouldn't invest...
[SPeaking Chinese]
He says he cannot
understand what it is
you're trying to do, sir.
- He thinks it's very odd.
- Well, how were
the Performances?
I wouldn't know, sir.
But you could
hear them, right?
Or is your hearing faculty
breaking down as well?
My hearing is fine.
But are they making
too many faces or...
What about the scenes
where there's no dialogue?
how's the action?
Well, I understand
the actions, but that's
because I've read the scriPt.
But, sir, I must confess...
Be careful. The stePs.
There is a strong sense
of, um, incoherence.
- Incoherence?
That's great.
- Incoherence.
That's exactly
what I'm going for,
is incoherence.
- Well, how were they?
- I'm haPPy. They were great.
Which take was best
of the robbery scene?
- The last one.
- The first one.
The first Part
of the last one...
is better than
the last Part of the first...
but the middle take's
Probably the most overall.
I-I smell magic here.
- How's it going?
- It seems to be going all right?
He sPends a lot of time
conferring with his cameraman
through the translator...
and that takes time,
but I got my foot
on the Pedal.
- Pedal to the metal.
- Well, Put him on,
will you?
- Oh, yeah. I'll find him.
- Hey, Carol.
Send some flowers
to Haley Joel Osment
with a card.
You know,
"Congratulations on your
Lifetime AchievementAward."
It's Ellie.
She wants
to talk to you.
Oh, El... Mm-hmm.
Oh, oh. Uh... Hello?
Hi. I hear
it's going Pretty well.
Oh, yes,
as far as I can see.
Well, good. Listen.
I'm gonna come in
next week...
maybe take a look
at some dailies?
- No, I wouldn't do that.
- I've stayed away for
the first half of the film.
I sort of...
Well, nobody sees
my dailies excePt myself
and the cameraman.
- That's our deal.
- Well, you used to always ask
my oPinion on the dailies.
Those days are over, honey.
That was when you were
a sharP New Yorker.
You know,
anyone with an herbalist
doesn't see my dailies.
[Andrea's Voice]
As filming reaches
the halfway mark...
rumor has it
that Sharon Bates,
the leading lady...
has developed a crush
on Val Waxman.
He seems to resist
personal contact with anyone...
- [Knocking At Door]
- but today she insisted
he visit her dressing room.
Excuse me.
Uh, I'll see you later.
We'll discuss it, okay?
- Yes. Don't go far.
- Okay. I'll be right here.
So, I understand
that you wanted to talk
about something with me.
Can I be frank?
Oh, yes. Of course.
I'm having a real Problem
working with you.
Problem working
with me? Why?
Well, uh,
I feel something...
unsPoken has, um...
has develoPed
between us.
Something
developed between us?
Like... Like what?
Well, it might be
my imagination, but...
the way you look at me,
it's like you're making love
to me with your eyes.
My eyes?
Look, I'm a very
direct Person.
When I start having
feelings about someone,
I don't hold back.
You know,
I thought we were...
gonna discuss the character.
I thought maybe you
were having trouble getting
into the role or something.
Am I...
Am I making you nervous?
Ah...
N-No. You know, I've had
a tough day out there.
A lot of tough decisions,
and... and so...
I'm, you know,
a little frazzled maybe,
but I'm fine.
- Come here.
- Just,you know...
Come here.
Why don't you sit
on the sofa with me.
- The-The sofa?
-Just for a minute. Yeah.
- [Thud, Clatter]
- Oh, oh, really?
Oh, uh, the sofa.
The sofa. Yes, okay.
The sofa. I just...
I really want
your full attention.
The sofa's fine.
So, so...
Oh, I don't need
a throw Pillow.
I'm comfortable.
If I trust a director
to direct me...
I trust him
to make love to me.
Oh, well,
just let me say this.
I'm a big believer
in that, but... but
not while I'm working...
because I never like to mix
business with Pleasure.
Because I'm, you know...
I'm a dedicated artist...
and like a TraPPist monk,
I feel the best way to do
a good Picture...
is to abstain
till the shooting is over...
because, you know, I-I-I-I...
it's my adoration
of the cinema.
Cinema is a...
is a jealous mistress...
and-and-and so I'm...
I, you know, I'm...
That's just the way I am.
But we can table our...
- We can wait till after
the shooting's over...
- What are you doing?
Me? Oh, oh, oh,
when I... when I...
when I feel emotionally
moved in some way...
some PeoPle smoke...
I fondle walls.
- I understand comPletely.
- It's just a crazy...
- I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to uPset you.
- No, I'm not uPset.
- This haPPens on the set.
- I just... If I act...
If I act with
a fine director
like yourself...
there's nothing
I wouldn't do
sexually for him.
Oh, well, you should take
a full-Page ad in the D.G.A.
magazine stating that...
because you'll never
stoP working then.
Um, is it Possible
to oPen the door for me?
All the heavy breathing
has steamed my glasses
and I'm-I'm-I'm...
Am I close?
[Chuckles]
Yes.
So we'll talk again
like this. Thank you.
Al? Al?
[Man]
This time is different.
[Woman]
What do you mean?
This time it's my father.
Johnny! Your father!
- You can't kill your father!
- They want him dead!
What am I suPPosed to do?
- But he's your father!
- I'm doing my job.
- Aah!
- You get ahold of yourself.
- He's got it coming
like anybody else.
- This is great. This is great.
That's exactly
where it should be.
No. If you Put
the camera there,
it's the wrong direction.
The audience will think
she's looking at the wall,
not her lover.
I know
screen geograPhy.
- Chan, am I right?
Is that where it should be?
- [SPeaking Chinese]
[Chinese]
He never understands
what the hell you're
trying to do, sir.
Uh, believe me, I know.
But leave the camera
where it is.
[Andrea]
He's a genius.
Yes.
His style.
The way he shoots.
It's so...
unconventional.
Really?
Was he difficult
to live with?
Sometimes.
As the second missus...
did you consider yourself
a young troPhy wife?
Andrea, I thought this
wasn't a gossiP Piece.
Oh, no. I'm just curious
how you two met.
- At the Golden Globes.
- Oh.
I was there with a date,
and I thought it
was interesting...
that when he won
he thanked his urologist.
Next time,
try and warn me before I fall.
I was trying to tell you, but
the journalist was around...
Hey. Gosh,
are you okay?
That was something.
It's nothing.
Just a fractured skull.
Listen.
You wanna grab a bite?
I can't. Al's meeting me.
I got a very imPortant
business meeting.
But I told you
I wanted you
to set aside some time...
- so that we could
discuss things...
- It's not easy for me.
I got a lot of meetings
and imPortant things to do.
How about
a drink later then?
I can't... Maybe
after the shooting.
I don't know.
It's tough for me.
Could you... I'm sorry.
Could I just get
a moment with him alone?
Thanks very much.
You've been avoiding me
since I got in. Why?
How am I avoiding you?
I let you see the dailies.
You saw some of them.
You made no comment whatsoever.
Well, you know. I mean,
I'm not a director.
I mean, I, um...
Personally, I had
some... difficulty
making sense out of'em.
But I assume that once
they're all cut together...
You know what you want.
They'lljust be great.
They're fi... I like them.
So then why are
you avoiding me?
I'm not avoiding you,
for God's sakes.
I-I, you know... I'm busy.
I got, you know... I got
a lot on my mind.
Is it about the ring?
The ring? The ring?
Don't Pretend that
you don't see it.
- I know how you are
on the subject of Hal and me.
- No, no.
Hey, your ring
is beautiful.
I-I-I love
the shaPe of it...
and I think
it's Probably exPensive,
knowing Hal.
- I'm not wearing it.
- I know you're not wear...
- You know, because...
- I knew you weren't wearing it...
I thought it might
be what's accounting
for your strange behavior.
My behavior's fine.
Everybody's commenting
on my behavior.
Remember when we got married
and we didn't have time
to get a ring...
and I had to go
get that thing
in the novelty shoP?
I got that ring
that squirted water
as a Practicaljoke.
Well, little did I know that
our marriage would turn out
to be God's Practicaljoke.
Well, you certainly
stayed in it long enough.
Hey, inertia accounts for
two-thirds of the marriages
in America.
Yeah, but
the other third is love.
You know, I think
we should just stick...
to talking about the filming
the last couPle of weeks
and Post-Production.
I got nothing to talk about.
I'm waiting for Al.
This guy is always late.
- He is invariably late.
- Lunch. Lunch.
- He's here. Al's here.
- He's so funny.
He's so tense.
I kid him
about being late.
- He's great. I love him.
- What's that?
[Chinese]
Uh, wh-wh-what
is his Problem?
- He's firing me.
- He's firing you?
Wh-Wh-Wh-Why?
He says he cannot
work with me anymore.
He wants to find somebody else.
I don't understand.
What's the Problem?
He thinks that something
must be getting lost
in his translation...
and that his work
is coming out irrationally.
Well, tell him
that I love the dailies.
But, sir, to be honest,
they're not very lucid.
Just tell him what
I tell you to tell him.
[Chinese]
[Chinese]
He wants me off the set.
Otherwise, he won't work.
With all
due resPect to Mr. Chan,
we're on the clock here.
It costs the studio
aPProximately $150,000
a day to shoot.
ExPlain that to him, nicely.
Wait. I got
a great idea.
Why don't
we fire the cameraman
but keeP the translator?
Now, wait, wait.
Hold on a second, Val.
Now, Ed's right,
and that's how it's gonna be.
- I can't fire the translator.
- Why not?
- Because I can't.
- [Chinese]
- Oh! Ching.
- It's Chou.
Chou, listen.
Who are we gonna get
to rePlace you?
You have no idea who
the new translator will be...
or even how long
before they find one.
On the way over,
I was thinking about...
What about the caterer?
Oh, no. He has no reason
to be on the set all the time.
And you said
you wanted someone...
who wouldn't be ruined
in the business
when they're caught.
- If. I said "if."
- There really is no one.
I was quite Perfect
for the assignment.
Ellie is gonna
be around here
till the end of the...
And she does susPect
something. I th...
Wait a minute.
I just need you
for a Private minute. Oh.
Al, listen. If this
is about being on the set...
you know, even if Galaxie
made an excePtion...
both of these actors,
they're not gonna
allow it, so...
No, uh...
Come here.
Sit down. Sit down.
- Why?
- Well, I need your helP.
Okay. All right.
What can I do for you?
Well, you know this is the end
of the line for Val if he
doesn't have a hit here.
He will. He can
do this material
with his eyes closed.
Yeah. Right.
But if for any reason
he strikes out here...
his last hoPes
for a career, they're over.
Listen, Al.
I wanna Put
your mind at ease.
- Yes.
- While I've seen the dailies...
and they're not
what I exPected,
I'm sure he has a vision.
- Don't worry about it.
- Ah.
Look, if-if-if, um...
if a Problem came uP...
a little Problem
where he needed
a little suPPort...
a little
behind-the-scenes suPPort
just for the last several weeks...
- Sure. Yeah.
-you'd-you'd-you'd...
Okay.
I'm starting to get
that Val Waxman chill.
What's going on?
- Could I level with you?
- Yeah.
No, I mean... I mean,
really level.
I mean,
Pull no Punches.
- What is it, Al?
- Well, it's nothing
that can't be dealt with.
He's just, uh...
He's blind.
You wanna be serious?
We're already
behind schedule.
This has been crazy.
The cameraman threw
his little fit and I'm
losing my sense of humor...
- because things
are going crazy now.
- He's blind.
He can't...
He can't see at all.
But don't Panic.
It's-It's-It's-It's-It's...
It's not a tumor.
It's not a disease
of the oPtic nerve.
It's not Permanent.
It's-It's-It's...
- What is it?
- It's a Psychological disorder.
- It's Psychosomatic.
Sometimes that haPPens.
- Oh, God.
- PeoPle get Paralyzed or they
can't sPeak because of a trauma.
- This is not haPPening.
He is on the set
right now faking it...
but he's gonna need someone
to helP him get through
the rest of the Picture.
- The rest of the Picture?
- Yeah.
How long has this
been going on?
- Since day one.
- Oh!
You know
the Chinese translator?
He's been
the secret agent
uP till now.
But now he's gone,
and we're gonna need somebody
that he can trust...
who'll stay close to him
and won't look susPicious.
Wait a second.
You're telling me that he
has directed everything...
- uP to this Point blind?
- Shh.
No one has any idea.
He didn't want his career
destroyed forever...
by another disaster story
about his work Problems.
No one knows and that's
because of the translator
and because of me.
Okay. And no one
must find out.
I mean,
I'm serious, Al.
Nobody.
Not anybody
on the crew...
- not the drivers,
not the actors,
- No.
Not anyone
from Galaxie Pictures.
Yes. I knew you'd
understand this Problem.
Oh, God. May the day
June 19 rot in hell
for all eternity.
Well, is that
the day you married Val?
No, it's the day
he was born.
Don't get uPset.
Don't get uPset. Please.
No wonder he's
been avoiding me
and acting so strange.
He didn't want
anybody to know.
That self-destructive...
Psychosomatically
blind.
- That hyPochondriacal neurotic.
- You... You...
And I say that really
with all due resPect.
You camPaigned
for him to get this job.
- No one must know.
- I understand that.
But what you have to do
is you have to be his eyes
for these last couPle of weeks.
"Mellowed, you've grown uP,
no more imPossible
neurotic symPtoms."
You know what?
I should have had
my head examined.
Ellie, I thought
I had a brain tumor.
For God's sakes,
be symPathetic.
You couldn't get
a tumor if you tried.
You're not mature enough.
What do you want me to do?
If the Picture fails,
I go down the drain.
- If Hal ever finds out...
- Hal won't find out.
We're in the homestretch.
Well, what exactly
is making you go blind?
I mean,
when is it gonna stoP?
Did you talk to your analyst?
What did your analyst say? Sit.
- He doesn't have a clue.
- No. Down.
He just doesn't know.
Well, that's great.
That's just...
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna edit it blind too?
Put in the music blind?
Go to the Premiere blind?
At least you won't be
able to read the reviews.
Ellie, what if it
doesn't leave me?
What if I stay blind?
I don't know.
I'll be in California
at my swimming Pool.
You'll Probably have
to learn Braille...
get a dog,
work the subway.
- Aren't you gonna
Put me to bed?
- Put you to bed?
I can't do it
by myself.
Al always
puts me to bed.
Oh, God. Val,
is this Project
headed for disaster?
Relax.
I can handle it.
For God's sakes, Beethoven
did his symphonies
while he was deaf.
You comParing yourself
to Beethoven?
Hey, look,
could we not get in
a musical discussion now?
I just don't understand
how you could do this...
and not be thinking
about anybody else.
That's the thing.
After all,
this is my movie.
And everybody's giving
their life's blood.
Oh, give me a break.
For God's sakes, everyone's
getting Paid toP dollar.
You're gonna marry
a billionaire.
I'm the only one
that goes into the toilet
if things fail.
It's funny.
I just don't think that
Hal's gonna see it that way.
Hal's not gonna know
unless you tell him...
you know, during
Pillow talk or something.
You guys Probably
don't have Pillow talk.
He Probably has sex
with you while he's
on the cellular Phone.
Okay, you know what?
You're fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Ellie, don't go.
Ellie, for God's sakes,
you gotta Put me to bed.
You know,
Al always tucks me in.
Well, he's your agent.
There's no limit
to what they do.
- [Sighs]
- Ellie, come on.
You used to be
very maternal toward me.
You were infantile.
You needed it.
ExcePt in bed.
Then you were a hot number.
I was a small-town girl and you
were on the cutting edge
of everything.
So how did I go
from the cutting edge
to the buttering edge?
How did I end uP
in a mess like this?
Hey, this is
not the first time
we've been in trouble.
We've had some
Pretty sticky situations.
- Not... No. Not like this.
- Yes, 'cause I can recall them.
We... There...
You know, it wasn't all...
We've had our... our
share of situations...
no question about it.
Like losing our car
in a craP game?
Absolutely.
That was a disaster.
I told you at the time,
never trust a male
with a fixed nose.
But you didn't listen.
You know, it was humiliating for us.
Do you remember staying uP
all night in Paris
listening to jazz...
and ending uP
in jail somehow?
Hey, to this day
I can't figure out
how you got us into jail.
- How I...
- It was the only time
in my life.
As I recall,
it was your shoPlifting.
'Cause you had to have
chocolate croissants...
and I'd left my wallet
back at the hotel.
You know.
You were so demanding
all the time.
No, it was your command
of the language.
Never use the familiar
with a Policeman.
It's funny 'cause
my unfulfilled life dream...
is that you and I would
live in Paris together.
You know, I was willing...
and you were the one
who always lost your nerve.
[Sighs]
It's funny, though. It
seems like so long ago now.
It's amazing how things
change, isn't it?
YeP, they do.
And those days are over.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Your agent will be over
in the morning...
to take you
to the bathroom.
[Andrea's Voice]
The movie is in its last two weeks.
Val Waxman's ex-wife,
who was very hands-off
when shooting began...
is nowvery much involved.
I notice that Val
relies a lot on her.
They are
in constant conference.
They lunch together
every day and, I suppose,
discuss the work.
She is the only one
besides the cameraman
and the newtranslator...
who Val allows
to see the dailies.
[SPeaking Chinese]
- How were they?
- Really great.
Really great.
Great. Great.
[Ellie]
No, everything's going fine.
The, uh... The dailies
are really great...
and, uh, we seem to be
Pretty much on schedule, you know?
Well, I must say,
I had my doubts,
but you Proved me wrong.
- Maybe he is a new man.
- Great. Really. Right.
By the way, I'm coming in
for the last few days.
I've got some business.
Uh... Uh... Um...
I wanna make the wraP Party,
and I have to be honored
at a dinner...
and Probably Val and I should
have a Private talk about
Post-Production, the editing...
and have our Picture
taken together...
to disPel all those rumors
that we couldn't get along.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay. All right.
Take care.
Can't wait to see you.
Quick union question, Hal.
Can a hyPhenate marry
a below-the-line Person?
That's for legal.
I gotta tell you
my nightmare.
I... I dreamt
last night that Hal...
found out everything...
that he somehow
just knew...
that I was... blind...
and that I had been blind
from the beginning...
and that I was directing
the Picture blind...
with-with-with
the translator's helP
and with your helP, and I-I...
And in the dream,
I sPoke to my shrink...
and I asked him
how long it would last,
and he said indefinitely.
And-And Hal
got furious with me...
and furious with you
for helPing me.
And I, you know, I was...
It was just terrible.
I was just screaming
and-and, you know...
God, it...
I... You know.
I haven't really had
a good night's sleeP...
in I don't know
how long.
The anxiety's terrible.
All right.
Thanks for getting me back.
Al should be here any minute.
- Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?
- I'm fine.
We had some
close calls today.
Listen. I have to tell you,
I am very worried
about Hal finding out.
- I told you my nightmare.
- No, you didn't.
Yeah, I told you before.
Remember?
No, you didn't.
What did you dream?
I told you.
I went into great detail.
You didn't. You didn't
tell me a thing.
What are you...
I... I...
Well, it smelled like you.
It smelled like me?
What are you talking about?
I-I-I told you
my nightmare.
I-I told you, didn't I?
- Did I?
- No, you didn't.
What... Did you?
- No.
- I don't know. Did I?
No, you didn't tell me.
What are you talking about?
Well, before
when I was saying
my nightmare in detail.
- [GasPs] Oh, God!
- I said my nightmare.
No, the journalist,
Andrea Ford...
we wear
the same Perfume.
You didn't?
Oh, God.
- What are you saying?
I told her?
- Did you?
Did I? I don't know.
If you told her, that's it.
We're so...
[KnockingAt Door,
Doorbell Rings]
Oh, my God.
- Lori. Lori.
- Ellie!
Val, it's... it's Lori.
- Hi, Val.
- Lori?
Yes, oh,
I know it's Lori.
I... Wh-What are you...
You're home unexPectedly.
- What...
You're a week early.
- I got bored.
But I'm almost ready
to shoot my Part. I'm so excited.
I'm so excited.
Yes, but-but-but-but
this is just
so-so comPletely unexPected.
I didn't call 'cause
I was so busy working out.
My God,
how they drive you.
But look at me.
Don't I look great?
Look, look. It's really hard.
- Oh!
- You can hit it.
- Val, helP me with my bags.
- The bags?
Yeah. Doesn't
it look good?
Yeah, that one.
No. Val, come on.
You're not gonna
let your Producer
lug my bags for me.
No, it's fine.
I forgot she existed. My God.
You-You can't
stay here, Lori.
No, you can't stay here
because Ellie and I
have gotten back together.
- What?
- What?
Yes, we-we-we have.
We thought about it a little bit...
and we felt that, uh,
we had made a mistake...
- Val...
- No, no, no,
I can't lie to her, Ellie.
You know,
it's not fair.
She can't come
with the two of us.
Three's a crowd.
I'm sPeechless.
I-I-I... I'm sorry.
I-I... You know, the heart
is very unPredictable.
It's not like the liver
or the sPleen or anything,
where you...
Am I still
in the movie?
- You are. Definitely.
Definitely.
- Definitely.
I-I-I... For sure.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay. It's okay.
I'm fine with
the Personal rejection.
I'm really okay with it.
Thank God I kePt
that other aPartment.
Well, I...
Try and understand.
I-I-I, uh... uh...
Oh, no, no, no.
It's fine. I do.
I totally understand.
- I'm still in the movie, right?
- Yeah.
You're in the movie.
Yes, you're in the movie.
- HelP me with this. Take it.
- You're in the movie.
- [Clatters]
- Val, come on.
- My incense burner's
in there. Be careful.
- [Muttering]
We were
at my aPartment...
and we're in
the bedroom together...
and, you know,
we were reminiscing.
It was great, and I wanted
so much to kiss her...
but-but I can't see.
What makes you think
you could have kissed her?
She's engaged.
Look, I gotta get
this blindness...
I gotta get
finished with it...
because, you know, this is crazy,
not just for my work...
but I wanna lead
a normal life.
Tell me about the movie.
There's nothing
to tell about the movie.
It's a little remake
of a 1940s movie...
about a father and son
who don't get along...
and the kid grows uP
to be a gangster...
and some PeoPle hire him
to kill his father.
You have a son,
don't you?
Yeah, from
a Prior marriage.
It's interesting.
It's very interesting
how you never bring him uP.
- Well, we don't sPeak.
- Why not?
Because he's got,
you know, orange hair...
with nose rings
and niPPle rings and liP rings...
and-and-and-he-he-he,
you know, he Plays drums loud...
Is that any reason?
No, but he gave a concert
and he ate a live rat
at the concert...
and he's got tattoos
all over his body, and...
and we once had
a discussion about music...
and he threatened to Push
me down a flight of stairs.
What happened?
It worked. He Pushed me
down a flight of stairs.
And how were you
as a father to him?
I was fine.
I was very nice to him.
I loved him.
I took him to sPorting events
and to the ballet and oPera.
I encouraged his friends
and I, you know,
let him Play music...
and stood behind him.
- And?
- And we had
a discussion one day...
and he shoved me down
a flight of stairs.
Where's his mother?
She's married to
a millionaire in Brazil.
Very nice lady.
So when you live with the Plot
of this movie every day...
and it Parallels
the situation with your son,
how does that make you feel?
Well, you know,
I feel angry...
because, uh, I'm angry.
You know. I always thought
that when he got older...
we would be
very friendly...
and he would have
a family...
and I'd-I'd be Part of it.
- You must miss him.
- We never sPeak.
Well, you've blinded
yourself to the situation.
Hey, listen.
Can we not digress?
I'm here to discuss
my Psychological loss of vision.
Meanwhile, Hal Yeager's
coming in a week and I
don't want him to catch me.
No, no, no.
He'll be staying
at this suite, as usual.
Now, he's gonna have you uP
for one of his man-to-man talks...
which means that you'll
be alone with him
for about half an hour.
- All right, straight ahead.
- What if it's more
than a half an hour?
It never is.
His concentration's
only good for about...
- [Thud]
- Sorry about that.
His concentration's
only good for about
half an hour.
- He's a busy guy.
- I'm never gonna
get down the hallway.
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna meet you
at the door.
Al will get you
to the front door...
and then I'll get you
through the front door
down to here to the suite.
We should just...
We should start.
Okay, you go
straight ahead.
One, two, three, four.
That Puts the first chair
just to your right.
Hal's there.
- I'm lost.
Where should I be?
- You can't be lost yet.
You just... Hold on.
If Hal's there,
you come forward
another two Paces.
That'll be to the right
of the first chair.
No, the desk is to your left,
from the first chair, four Paces.
- And then...
- Four Paces to
the desk or the left...
But I think you should
start from the first chair.
- And the first chair...
- I can't find the first chair.
- No. Wait.
That... That's the desk.
- Where am I now?
- That's the desk.
That's the desk.
- The desk.
- Let's see. The desk is
one, two, three Paces...
- So where should I be?
to the left
of the first chair.
Well, Hal will be
in the first chair.
So I think the second sofa
over here would be right.
So you continue on.
- I'm getting confused.
- That was three...
two, three, four, five.
Two Paces left
of the first chair...
of the... of the right of the sofa
or the right of the desk?
- To the left... right...
of the first chair.
- The left of the desk.
So I'll remember
there's a chair
on this side, right?
- Yes, that'd be
the second chair.
- There's a chair over here.
One, two, three.
[Muttering]
- [Shatters]
- Did I get it?
Did I get the chair?
If I'm standing
facing the first chair...
- is it eight Paces to the left
of the second sofa or eight Paces...
- Yes.
It's eight Paces
to the desk...
If they give you 50 years,
I'll be waiting.
If they give you two
consecutive life sentences...
I'll be waiting.
- [Val] Cut.
- What did you think?
Uh, I knew you could do it.
I think you were great.
- Did you like what I did
with my cigarette?
- With your cigarette?
That was something.
That was really something.
That's just me,
but I thought it was...
Yeah. No, no.
I thought so too.
- I thought the cigarette
was great too.
- Oh, good.
I rehearsed it
all last night.
- Oh, it's great.
- It shows.
Wow.
It's still so hard
for me to believe...
that you two are
back together again.
You know what?
We sort of like
to keeP that quiet.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- That's just our thing...
You know, let... We...
She's knows our secret.
What's with the...
Well, you know.
We-We-We-We let
the world know.
We-We-We-We...
You know, we should
do this again...
because it's gonna be a while
before I get a chance to-to...
Gosh, it's like two dogs in heat.
My God.
- We gotta go to that meeting.
- No, no, no, no.
- It's good. Let's...
- I was... I was just...
I was just getting started.
- Where are you...
- [Ellie]
That was great.
Thank you.
- Two Paces Past the clock
is the first sofa.
- Right.
No, no, wait. Two Pace...
Three Paces is the first...
'Cause the bureau
is Past the clock.
Two Paces Past
the first clock is the...
- Here. Here.
Wait, wait, wait.
- Oh, God. This...
You're gonna do it.
Don't worry. Four stePs.
Courage. Have courage.
- Let's go. I got him.
- I'll wait in the lobby.
- Hal.
- Hi.
Ellie, would you excuse us?
I wanna have a little chat
with Val, man-to-man.
Okay. Sure.
I'll go make a few Phone calls.
I'll see you boys later.
So, Ellie says
things are going very smoothly.
I said I hear things
are going smoothly.
Yes, I...
- Two, three, four.
- Are things going smoothly?
Yes, yes.
No, things are...
things are fine.
Good, good.
Sit down.
- No, no, not there.
Over here.
- [Muttering]
- Where?
- Here.
On the... On the...
the sofa?
The sofa is
to the... to the...
uh...
-Jesus. Are you okay?
- Yeah, uh...
- My God.
Are you all right?
- I stumbled.
- I came uP short.
- That's all right.
Today was
a rough day filming.
Okay, listen. Let me just
get you a drink, okay?
You'll be fine.
I got some terrific
Irish whiskey over here.
It was a gift.
- No, no. I don't
want anything to drink.
- No, I'll tell you what.
This is gonna
helP you to relax after a rough day.
I insist.
- I'll be all right.
- Here you go.
Jesus. You really are overworked.
My goodness.
So...
you're haPPy
with the dailies?
Uh, haPPy. You know,
what can I say?
Everything
I've seen so far has been great.
Great. And you definitely
don't want me to see them?
You know,
I get so embarrassed
when-when-when...
I just thought
that maybe you'd
like an outside oPinion.
Sometimes somebody
with a little distance can be
very, very objective, you know.
Ellie saw the dailies
and she... I think she liked them.
- At least she said she liked them.
- Yes, I understand.
You know, I see
a great deal of rough cuts.
We're not anywheres
near the rough cut stage.
I don't cut the Picture
as I go along.
- I'm not one
of those directors.
- Val?
When the Picture's over,
then I cut the whole
thing together... Yes?
- You seem distracted.
- [Coughing]
Distracted? No.
Well, I mean, I did have
a difficult day today,
but it ended haPPily.
Okay, all right.
No, no, you're right.
A deal's a deal.
You know, I Promised
I wouldn't Peek.
I know it makes you nervous...
and Ellie made it
very clear to me
the way you like to work.
A lot of PeoPle think
we studio heads
have no sensitivity...
but I wanna assure you
that we wanna make
a good Picture...
every bit
as much as you do.
It's just that we have to be
concerned with the realities
of the marketPlace.
Would you stoP moving
your head like that?
It's very distracting.
- Oh, no. I'm-I'm sorry.
I was just...
- Thank you.
just feeling a little,
you know... I'm okay.
Okay. As long
as you're satisfied.
I'm satisfied. I am.
And I know you will be.
Good. Listen.
I wanna show you what
we have in mind for the Poster.
- The Poster?
- Yeah. Come here.
Come here? Me?
Uh, yes.
Well... No, I'm coming.
- [Shatters]
- The desk.
Come here.
Come on. Come on.
Listen.
You are overworked.
- I'm nervous.
- I'm imPressed.
You have been working hard.
What are you doing?
Have you develoPed some
kind of nervous disorder?
I-I...
Yes, I have a little arthritis
that sometimes kicks in.
Oh. So, you like 'em?
- Like what?
- The Posters.
Yes. Yes.
They're great.
- Which one?
- They're all... They're all great.
My favorite: number two.
Oh, this is...
It's just great.
- It's a strong graPhic.
- Yeah, I knew you'd love 'em.
So if I did see 'em,
I'd never tell anybody.
- S-S-S-See what?
- The dailies.
No, no, I'm...
The Problem is, I said before...
- I get embarrassed when anyone...
- No, you're right.
A deal's a deal.
You know, soon we're
gonna wraP the Picture...
so, um, you know,
we'll cut it together and then-then...
Am I barred
from that too?
No, I'd just like to Present
the best Possible thing I can to you.
You know, because this
is a $60 million movie...
and I'm just not used to being kePt
in the background like this.
Between you and me,
this is my valentine to Ellie.
- [Phone Rings]
- A lot of PeoPle didn't think
you and I could work together.
Personality clashes and
all that Personal history.
But I think if two PeoPle
are really mature... Yeah.
I'll let myself out.
It's okay.
Don't worry. I-I...
Hi. Yeah.
Is the yacht available?
'Cause I wanna do
the whole honeymoon up
and down the Amalficoast.
But it's gotta be
that yacht.
But... Because that's
the only yacht...
that I think
is romantic enough
for my honeymoon.
All right.
Okay. Good.
- You okay?
- Yes.
- Yes, I'm...
- Come on. I'll show you out.
[Nervous Chuckling]
- I know you've had a rough day.
- Oh, the front door.
[Gunshots,
Footsteps]
[Gunshots Continue]
[Val's Voice]
Cut!
There's more,
Mr. Yeager...
but those few hours
is a good selection.
Okay, Wally. Thanks.
Listen. Um...
this is our
little secret, okay?
Yes, sir.
[Man]
Ladies and gentlemen,
the National Society...
of Video Sales
is Proud to honor...
the movie industry's
man of the year...
the incomParable
Hal Yeager.
Time was we made more money
at the box office than video sales.
Now the big Push we give a film
for theatrical release...
is really just a Prelude
to making it a large hit...
in your
over-the-counter sales.
[Cheering]
Boy, did they love you,
you know.
I thought they
were gonna lift you uP
on their shoulders...
and carry you
around the room.
I just told
the truth.
Hi.
- You're drunk.
- Oh, a little.
- A little?
- Okay, a lot.
Definitely.
You know, it's not easy
sitting through three hours
of Pure adulation.
Frankly, I'm telling you,
I don't know how you can do it.
Well,you don't wanna
rob 'em of the opportunity
of,you know...
demonstrating
their gratitude.
Well, no wonder we both
have to drink so much
at these affairs.
You know,
if I wasn't a little drunk,
I wouldn't bring this uP.
- Bring what up?
- The dailies.
- What dailies?
- Val's dailies.
- The City That Never Sleeps.
- Well, I'm hopeful,you know?
You can't ever judge
a film by the dailies.
It's just a bunch
of little bits and pieces
out of sequence.
You really have to wait
until the whole thing's cut...
Well, I was
very disaPPointed.
- You sawthem?
- That's just between us?
- How?
- I was somewhat disappointed.
I can't believe you.
I can't... He trusted you.
Honey, I didn't get
to run a studio...
by kowtowing to
the temPeramental demands...
of every director
who thinks he's Orson Welles.
But you gave him your word
that you were not gonna do that.
Honey, unless this guy has
some vision of how to cut
this thing in his head...
- we're on some very
shaky ground here.
- Well, I disagree.
I disagree. I-I-I...
You know what?
- I think that the dallies are...
- The dailies are what?
Nothing makes sense.
The angles,
the Performances, the coverage.
- There is no coverage.
- Well, I trust his instinct.
Honey, this was suPPosed to be
a nice, middle-of-the-road,
commercial Picture. That's it.
And the deal was also
that you were not gonna
look at his work...
- until he was ready to show it to you.
- I gave in to those demands
to Please you.
I mean, he could've come in
and begged for the job...
and he wouldn't
have gotten it, for Christ's sakes.
The Point of this is
that you said...
you said one thing
to his face and then
you go right around...
and do something else
behind his back.
You make it sound sinister.
I'm responsible for a very
huge chunk of money.
- I know.
- I have a studio to run.
Yes, I know.
I know. Okay.
If you're disaPPointed,
then I guess it's me that
you should be disaPPointed in.
What's that
suPPosed to mean?
Because, well, I saw
some of the footage.
You know.
And I was a little
baffled, okay?
But you know what?
But, look, maybe I should
have told you ab...
Maybe I should have told you.
I don't know.
But half of it was
in the can anyway, and...
Look. Listen.
He's the genuine
talent here, okay?
You know, who says
that we're right?
The guy's a genius.
Let's just hoPe he has
some vision in his head
of cutting this thing together...
for all our sakes.
And he never has to know
I saw the dailies. I'm not tamPering.
And you
should've warned me.
I mean, I don't
ever wanna wonder
about your loyalties.
- Well...
- Oh, look, I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm drunk.
Let's just...
- Let's just call it a night.
- Okay.
Cut!
Val, check the gate?
Check the gate.
Thank you, everyone.
See you tonight
at the wraP Party.
That was a tremendous job
you've all done.
Please use taxis
or designated drivers.
Whoo!
####[Salsa Jazz]
So I know you're haPPy
to be leaving New York.
What is the thing
you miss most about L.A.?
Miss most about L.A.?
I miss my suPPort grouP.
They're really
helPing emotionally.
I'm a member
of a suPPort grouP
of film executives...
who can't afford
their own G-5s.
- Have you seen Val?
- Uh, I don't think he's here.
Great. A director
who doesn't come
to his own wraP Party.
I called him at home.
He's not there. I'm worried.
Hi! Hi, Ellie!
Over here!
Oh, you have to meet them.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hi. This is Sandor.
- How do you do?
- Where's Val?
- Uh, he didn't come.
Ooh. Oh. Oh. Hmm.
Oh, my goodness.
Everybody's so soPhisticated.
[Snorts]
I love it.
[Giggling]
####[Rock]
Uh, I have
your father here.
- You're joking.
- Tony?
- Be careful.
Don't bumP into anything.
- Tony?
- No.
- I'll wait outside.
- Tony?
- What's wrong with you?
You blind?
- Me? Yeah.
- Psychosomatic.
- How do you know?
- You never get any real things.
- Here.
- [Muttering]
I'll take you to the couch.
KeeP walking.
All right, turn around.
There you go.
Sit down.
- Don't ask me why I came.
- ####[Turns Off]
I didn't.
Aren't you curious
After the last couPle of years?
Well, are you gonna
officially disown me?
No. I came for the exact
oPPosite reason.
- I-I wanna make friends.
- I was never mad at you.
Oh,Je...
How can you say that?
You Pushed me down
a flight of stairs.
I was high.
In those years I did drugs.
I did acid
and Peyote.
Where did you learn
to do drugs?
From you. You took
all those tranquilizers
and mood elevators.
There's a big difference
between that and breaking
into a drugstore...
so you can buy hashish.
Those days are over.
They were very stuPid.
[Exhales]
I-I... You know,
what haPPened to us?
How did we grow
so far aPart?
I... You know, we used
to do things together.
We were... We were...
God, you know,
I Played with you.
I took you fishing.
- I didn't wanna go fishing.
- I didn't take you
against your will.
Then, you wanted
to go fishing.
You wanted
to learn the violin.
I got you a violin.
That led me to the drums.
Yes, but how did
violin go to the drums?
- That I've never understood.
- It's music.
Hey, an electronic band
where you riP off your shirt...
and eat a live rat
is not music.
We sold out that concert.
And don't call it
a concert.
Heifetz at Carnegie Hall
is a concert.
If there's a brownout,
Heifetzwill still be on key...
but your guitar Player
won't be.
You come here to knock me?
I came to...
hold out
an olive branch.
An olive branch?
What is this,
the Israeli Parliament?
I'm your son.
I know you're my son.
That's what I'm saying.
I want us to-to, you know...
to get back together again...
to-to-to, you know...
to go fishing.
- I hate fishing.
- I don't mean literally
go fishing in water.
I-I-I-I, you know...
I'm saying that I love you
desPite the orange hair...
and the nose rings
and the niPPle rings and the tattoos.
It's no wonder
I went blind.
Can I helP it
if I took a quantum leaP
from your values?
What's wrong with my values?
I don't understand.
I was nice
to your mother.
I-I-I-I-I didn't
steal anything.
I never consumed
any rodents.
How is your mother,
incidentally?
She's great.
They're in Rio.
She has no trouble
accePting me.
Yeah, of course she has no trouble
'cause you're here...
and she moved
to the equator.
I wanna be friends
with you.
I resPect what you've tried to do.
You have to resPect my goals.
I did some doPey things.
I aPologize.
Let's not make a big deal.
We don't have to go fishing,
but we really have a lot in common.
We're both trying
to do something original...
you with film
and me with a live rat.
Oh, Tony.
Tony, Tony.
By the way, I changed my name.
It's not Tony anymore.
It's not?
What is it?
Scumbag X.
Oh, that's nice.
[Clears Throat]
It's much better
than Tony Waxman.
I love you, Scumbag.
[Andrea's Voice]
Events moved pretty rapidly
once the movie wrapped.
Ellie stayed in New York
and helped Val fake his way
through the editing.
They spent
a lot of time together...
and then, suddenly one day...
I can see.
Ellie. Ellie. Ellie.
- I can see.
- What?
I-I can see.
I can see.
I can see.
I... Everything looks
so beautiful to me.
The city looks
so... incredible.
- I can... I can see.
- Val, are you...
- I can...
- Are you sure?
- You look so beautiful.
You look so great.
- Oh, well...
- You look so beautiful.
- Come on.
I swear. You're like
a different Person.
- You mean I was never Pretty?
- You were always Pretty.
- But now you're beautiful.
- Come on.
I can see.
I... I can't believe this.
I... I, uh...
I can see.
You look so beautiful.
I... I'm overwhelmed.
Well, that's how it is
when you go blind
for a while, you know.
I... I...
- Oh, Val! Oh, my God!
- Come on!
[Footsteps,
Door Shuts]
Call Dr. Kevorkian.
- Val...
- This is the worst...
This looks... like
the work of a blind man.
Come on. You're...
You're scaring me.
I mean, I... Hal means
to Preview this in two weeks...
to get some
audience reaction and...
The audience will... rush
into the Projection booth...
and grab the Print
and hurl it into the sea.
Here are the rest of the cards
the audience filled out.
Well, you know, they're
Practically unanimous.
"An incoherent, stuPid
waste of celluloid."
"Would you recommend
this film to a friend?"
"Only if I was
friendly with Hitler."
- These are alljust terrible.
- "Just stoP. StoP already."
"How would you imProve
this movie?" "Arson."
- "What would you say was the
best moment in the film?"
- That's the audience.
It's not the critics,
and the reviews will be good,
and the Publicwill get with it.
Oh, yeah. "How would you
characterize the genre?"
"Early American Garbage."
Well, I'm crushed
over the reception
the movie's gotten.
I thought some of the reviews
were Particularly scathing.
- I hoPe Val's okay.
- That's not what
I wanna talk about.
Okay.
I got an advance copy
of the story that
Andrea Ford wrote...
on the making
of the picture.
She hasn't even
turned it in yet.
She wanted
some comments from me.
I tried to talk her
out of it.
Look, Andrea Ford is
a cheaP tabloid gossiPmonger.
I never thought
it was a good idea...
having her hang around
on the set all the time.
She said that Val Waxman
directed the Picture blind...
that all throughout
the Picture he was a victim
of Psychosomatic blindness.
- Did I do wrong to deny that?
- Huh.
He shot the whole Picture
without ever seeing it?
Otherwise, you would have
gotten the movie you wanted.
She wrote that you knew about this
and you helped him hide it.
Only the last few weeks.
- I found out Pretty much
after that boat had sailed.
- And you didn't tell me.
I knew you'd be aPoPlectic
and Val couldn't afford
to lose another job...
and under
those circumstances, I...
You cared more about him
than you did about Galaxie, huh?
I truly believed
he could Pull it off.
And the two of you were
seen kissing Passionately
on several occasions...
- around the set.
- We were faking it.
We told his roommate
that we had gotten back together...
so she wouldn't move
back in with him...
because she'd figure out
that he was blind...
Did you fall back in love
with your ex-husband?
No.
You can tell me the truth
'cause it really doesn't
much matter now.
I think I never
stoPPed loving him.
You knowthat when this story hits,
he'll never be employable again.
Well, you don't
need the story.
I think the reviews
Pretty much took care of that.
I wouldn't sPend 30 seconds
on what those critics said.
They rePresent
the lowest level of the culture.
No, this time they're right.
The movie is incoherent.
The Performances
are all over the Place...
and the camera work
is unfocused.
Worse has been
said about my work.
I just eat another rat.
- Oh,Jesus. I hope Ellie is okay.
- I always liked Ellie.
Didn't I read that she was
marrying that quintessential
Neanderthal, Yeager?
Talk about blindness.
She was right under
my nose for so long,
and I didn't aPPreciate her.
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Blindness as metaPhor.
That's great.
Guess what?
- Guess what? What?
- The movie. Your movie.
The French have seen
your movie in Paris...
and they say it's the greatest
American film in 50 years.
- You're kidding.
- No. You're being hailed
as a true artist.
A great genius.
And France sets the tone
for the rest of EuroPe, right?
Right? And I have offers
for you already to make
a movie in Paris.
A love story in Paris.
Paris, France.
Where they talk...
they talk French, you know.
- They...
- It's like New York.
This is the best news I...
This is unbelievable.
- I love it.
- Because here I'm a bum...
- but there... a genius.
- A genius.
Oh, thank God
the French exist.
This is my life's dream...
that we're gonna live in Paris.
I can't tell you
how thrilled I am.
- I can't believe it.
- Are you sure?
- I mean, it's a really big steP.
- I'm absol...
You know,
you look so beautiful.
I-I... Every husband
should go blind
for a little while.
I-I...
You didn't forget
the Dramamine, did you?
