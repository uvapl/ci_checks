Once upon a time, there was a little girl-
- [ Girl Giggling ]
- just like any other little girl.
- And like most little girls-
- [ Girl ] / gotcha.!
she loved collecting
beautiful things.
Look it what I have.
Always sharing them
with her friends.
Hello.
Come on over and meet
my friends, Hoppers.
She would throw the most amazing tea
parties for her very closest companions.
Mr. Elephant, have you met my daddy?
He's the governor, you know.
- And then it happened.
- [ Man /ntroducing President ]
You know that awkward
but typical time oflife...
- when you feel like every eye is on you-
- [ Man ] Mackenzie.!
like you're the main attraction
in a three-ring circus.
That's right.
She became a teenager.
But eventually,
she made it through.
And as she blossomed, she became
more comfortable with herself.
- There she is. Hey, Sam. How you doing?
- Hi, Dad.
Hi, sweetie. I'd like you to meet-
And like most teenagers,
she enjoyed parties...
- and pizza.
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.
- And like her peers...
she often felt as ifher every move
was scrutinized.
- Hold it right there.
- Big smile, Sam.
Mom, promise me you would never let me
leave the house looking like that.
Never! It looks like she found
Chelsea Clinton's old crimping iron...
and Amy Carter's Sassoons.
It's like a terrorist
got a hold of her.
I don't know what's going on.
But what do you think?
What is the worst outfit that you have
ever seen Samantha wear?
- I'll bet it's gonna be close.
- I bet it is too.
There have been
a lot of lousy outfits.
/f Mac is back, get in there
and clean out your kid's closet.
- [ Narrator ] But with maturity...
- Thank you.
- [ Speaking French ]
- she was able to look outside herself...
and appreciate the wisdom
ofher elders.
And I'll tell you something.
Decades in politics give you...
special life skills, Sam.
Like an excellent poker face.
- [ Laughs ]
- Not bad, Senator Downer.
- Thank you for the tip.
- [ Laughter ]
[ Narrator ]
/n short...
- she grew up... happily...
- Good night.
- with the love of a father...
- Good night, Sam.
- and a mother...
- See you in the morning, sweetheart.
who she thought
were the center of the world...
in an old white house...
they called home.
[ Man Singing Swing ]
Lucky Charm's on site.
- [ Continues ]
- Something wrong with Sam.
[ President ]
Are you sure? /t's an election year, remember?
[ First Lady ]
She could use a little down time.
Starting November 5,
she can have all the down time she needs.
[ Woman ] Mr. and Mrs. Latif Moratee,
President Mackenzie, First Lady...
- Samantha.
- Hello.
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Samantha.
- [ Foreign Language ] Please.
- [ Foreign Language ]
This way.
We have press conference
at 9:00. To Marine One, 9:15.
To Air Force One at 10:00.
Travel time, four hours, 59 minutes.
Twenty-five minutes
to destination Redmond Univ-
Hold that thought, Liz.
[ Sighs ]
Let's pretend that tomorrow
I'm heading off to college.
- Mm-hmm.
- I grab my bags, which I packed myself.
I throw them into
my adorable collegiate car...
next to my cooler that has a beer hiding
underneath the bologna sandwiches.
My parents cry.
Their only child is growing up and so forth.
And then I do it.
I drive off like the normal,
run-of-the-mill kid that I am.
You're still a princess.
You should at least wear a ball gown.
Ignorance is bliss.
What can I say?
I say, good night,
normal, boring girl.
And you better hide that beer,
because under the sandwiches-
that's the first place
they'll look.
- Duly noted.
- Good night.
- [ Door Closes ]
- [ Sighs ]
[ Running Footsteps ]
Did you take the southern route
through the stairwell...
or the northern route
through the access hall?
- Eastern route.
- Oh!
Two elevators, one moving walkway,
turn left at the Lincoln arches.
- It's lesser-known, but very effective.
- Mm-hmm.
Eastern route's one of
my favorites, actually.
And that Lincoln arches thing
is a very nice touch.
You know, if you're gonna
eat this cake...
you have to pay the toll.
- Inflation.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, you should really
do something about that, Dad.
Mm-hmm.
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
- Not the dancing.
- Dancing.
[ Humming ]
- Ready?
- Ready.
Good.
- I need to say something.
- Okay.
About tomorrow.
- I was thinking-
- Mm-hmm.
and maybe I should go alone.
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean...
it's hard enough to blend in, having a team of
Secret Service men carrying my books, then-
Uh-huh.
All I'm saying-
I just wanna be
like everybody else.
Sam, you're not like
everybody else.
Ready?
It's the big finish.
Here it comes.
Yes.! Yes.
They won't ask you about policy.
They'll probably ask you about...
your expectations, your hopes,
your major, and you'll say-
Don't worry, Liz. I'm set.
Does anyone have my-
- Got it.
- Thank you.
So, you're just like
any other American family.
Whose daughter is
heading off to college.
Remember, today you're not just
the First Lady, but you're also a mom.
I'd like to think
I'm both women every day.
In short, you're just a proud dad.
Like every other dad...
watching his little girl
head off to California for college.
You can segue into your education
reform initiative from there.
And time permitting, Mr. President,
the California Youth Literacy Program.
- It's not a stump speech. It's about my daughter.
- Right.
Mr. President,
how do you feel about your only child...
going to school
so far away?
Well, uh, I could suggest
moving the nation's capitol to California.
- [ Laughter]
- Samantha, will you miss D.C.?
And better yet,
what will you miss least?
Wow. That's a tough one.
Well, I can't tell you
what I will miss the least...
but I can tell you
what I will miss the most.
That is my friends
and my family.
But I am very excited to experience life
as a normal kid...
having a normal
college experience.
- Thank you.
- [ Press Secretary ] Thank you. We don't have any more time.
- Thank you very much.

- [ Woman ] Hi, Sam.
- [ Cheering ]
You know, hon,
it's not too late to call Georgetown.
Live at home.
Free laundry.
Dad, I didn't choose a school
3,000 miles away for nothing.
- [ President ] Roommate's name?
- [ First Lady ] Mia Thompson.
Parents Janet and Kyle.
Divorced.
Both strong supporters
in the polls.
I heard that.
Well, that's odd.
They were supposed to be here by now.
Once I heard a rumor, Mom, that there are
actually some people out there...
that don't live
a minute-by-minute schedule.
How do they live?
Roommate's caught in traffic.
E.T.A. is 10 minutes.
She should at least get the good bed
if she has to live with me.
Did you check
that itinerary with Liz?
- For?
- Well, there are just a few small functions...
your father and I thought
that you might enjoy attending.
Yeah. Uh, do I have a choice?
Sir.
- Oh, yeah. Honey-
- Already?
Like you're not chomping at the bit
for us to get outta here.
Well, the President
and the First Lady, yes.
[ Sighs ]
Mom and Dad? Not so much.
Let's go.
You've got a campaign to run.
- Three, two, one.
- ["Hail to the Chief"]
You remember, a full load of laundry
dries faster than half a load.
Always take the stairs.
Don't sweat the petty things.
Yeah, don't pet
the sweaty things either.
And your father will be here
all... week campaigning.
- If you need anything, call Liz.
- I'll be fine. Thank you.
You'll be great.
Okay, look at me,
at a loss for words.
Just tell me you'll miss me, Dad.
[ Kisses ]
So, when the election's over, uh,
we'll spend some time together.
A whole day, 24 hours.
In a row?
Promise.
Be a good kid.
[ Boy ]
Hey, Sam.
- Please be mellow.
- On one condition.
Could we major in something fun?
I'm really hoping we're not premed.
Light on the math.
Zip it, Bock.
And, Dylan?
Especially you.
Not another word.
[ Hinge Creaks ]
[ Zipping ]
Look, if you're gonna be going through
my stuff,at least you can help me carry it.
Are you aware there are two huge
individuals with stun guns...
sticky hands and no manners
flanking our door?
- You must be Mia.
- And you're not Linda.
[ Paper Rustling ]
Redhead. Paterson, New Jersey.

Surprise.
I'm Samantha Mac-
You're not as tall in person.
I'm really excited about this year.
There's so many things I wanna do.
- No offense, Miss Mackenzie-
- Samantha.
Samantha-
but I have a plan...
- of college.
- That's great.
Look, I'm just trying to have
a normal college experience, okay?
- All I want is normal, Mia.
- Right.
I'm going to
the housing office.
They said you were the kind of girl
who was up for anything.
I'm disappointed.
- You're manipulating me.
- Yes.
It's kinda working.
Please, Mia.
Just give it a shot.
That's all I'm asking.
Well, the situation
could have its advantages.
Absolutely.
Like, in case of a national emergency...
guess who gets a free seat
on the chopper?
I was kind of thinking your Secret Service
could get us beer.
- You can forget about that.
- We'll work on it.
Mia Thompson,
Arkansas royalty.
I didn't know they had
royalty in Arkansas.
Course we do.
My dad's a king.
I mean, he's had
a few queens since my mom, but-
You know, Tire King-
best seller of the South?
Cool. This is Bock. Dylan's outside.
They're protecting us.
Could that involve tackling me?
'Cause the bald one's a little sexy.
And you can forget
about that too.
[ Laughs ]
Yeah.
Look, bonus points for giving me the good bed.
I like you already.
But just to let you know,
don't kiss my ass.
'Cause I certainly
won't be kissing yours.
Mia, I like you already.
It's our first day.
I'm trying to have fun.
Why don't you change clothes?
We can go hang out. Go to some parties.
Meet some guys.
Definitely meet some guys.
My night's scheduled already.
I thought I looked okay, no?
Oh, yeah, sure. If you're trying
to hang out with the dean.
Miss Mackenzie, / speak
for the entire faculty...

"Welcome to Redmond. '"
And I assure you
that you'll be treated just like any student...

Of course, the fundamental
importance of agenda control...
was established by McKelvey...
irrespective of implications
for the final outcome.
/n fact, one ofhis
most notable papers showed...
that the one person, one vote...
system of voting...
did not always lead to a middle ground
in decision making.
The manipulation of agenda could have
a great impact on policy making.
[ Continues, Fades ]
You missed a great party.
- Sorry about that.
- Fortunately, I can provide you...
with another normal
college experience...
in which the roommate
kicks you out in the name of-

Can I just get my-

- Minutes?

I shall do my best...
to see to it that your intellect
is satisfied.
And your soul is at peace.
And your vessel
is filled this semester.
For starters, would it be possible
to shift your attention to me?
I know I'm not as pretty,
but, uh, come on.
- Work with me.
- Excuse me, Professor?
- Yes.
- I didn't see anything in the syllabus about a vessel.

that I'm supposed to buy...
but I don't see any mention
about a vessel of any kind.

for rescuing me in there.
It was nothing.

of person who needs rescuing.
I'm Samantha.
I know I'm taller in person.
Fatter, thinner, fill in the blank.
I get that.
Actually, I was gonna say
you look exactly like I thought you would.
Bye, Samantha.
- We're moving.
- Not bad, Ms. Mackenzie.
You really shouldn't
objectify men like that, Mia.
- The boy is fine.
- Hi, Samantha.
Nice meeting you too. Hello.

And it doesn't agree with me.

I cannot believe how many cute guys
there are here.
Last time I was at a party like this,
I could only fill out a ruffled bikini.
Focus, Sam.
We are at a frat party.

This is fantastic.

I'm blending in too.

- Don't tell me he's too busy. I need to talk to him.
- You look great.
- What's going on, Sam?
- He has got too many Secret Service following me around.
- I can't take it anymore.
- Sam, it's an election year. Remember that.

and let me handle it. Okay?
Calm down.
/'ll see ifhe has a minute.
- Create my own forum.
- [ Liz ] Mr. President?
- Liz?
- Your daughter's asking for reduced security at college.
She's very unhappy, sir.
Um, can this wait?
- Go ahead.
- We'll invite the press.
- It's not a good time.
- Fine.
Just tell him I'll ditch the whole
college thing and become a Hooters girl.
- Good benefits, I hear.
- [ Sighs ]
- Sir?
- Yeah, it's- Liz.
There is a precedent
for reduced security.
I recommend cutting back
from four agents to two per shift.
Keep detail on the floor,
but not stationed at the room.
Sir, she's miserable.
Okay.
Be right back.
Man.
I came this close to wearing
that exact bikini today.
Dad, if you want your daughter to have
any friends, we need to make some changes.
Yeah, well, I don't negotiate
with people in swimwear. Come here.
Dad, when Chelsea was at Stanford,
her Secret Service backed off.
They blended in.
They wore Birkenstocks.
Sam, I want you
to listen to me.
A navy blue suit with Birkenstocks
is a really bad look.
That was another time.
This is a real different world
we live in, Sam.
It is not like I am sleeping around
and getting drunk, Dad.
Come on.
You were my age once.
All I am asking for
is a shred of normalcy.
I can't go out and party
like my friends.
No.
No, you can't.
Forget it.

We got it from here.
And then there were two.

Lunge at me. Hit me. Tackle me.
Come on, you know you wanted to.
We could just celebrate.
I've narrowed it down to three target areas...
- which, if we hit quickly-
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
Or maybe it's just right under our noses.
What's going on there?
Sam, I don't think
that's a party.

his frequent-flier miles...
Samuels is right here,
right now at home.

or do you only do what Daddy tells you?

All right, there you go. Another Mackenzie
running away from the real issues.
- What was that?
- Freedom of speech.
They have the right
to express their beliefs.
Okay, the freedom goes both ways.
Why don't you get to speak your mind?
- Fine. You wanna know what I think?
- Yeah.
Well, I think
my father's administration...
gives a great deal of attention
to his domestic agenda.
- Take his college tuition-
- Blah, blah, blah. End of sound bite.
It's kind of hard to get that stuff
out of your head, huh?

- Go ahead. I'm listening.

- In a thong.
- Correct.
- Okay. Put her on.
[ Sighs ] Mr. President?
Mia Thompson here.
Now, with all due respect, although I do
think your diplomatic skills are top-notch...
I think you really need
some serious parenting advice.
Really?
You know what, Mia?
I could not agree
with you more.
- What?
- It's great to know...
my daughter is living with
such a sensible young woman.
You've got that rare thing, Mia.
You know what it is? It's character.
Some people have it, some people don't.
You have it.
Really? Thanks.
Um, I mean, you too.
That whole China thing was real good.
Yeah, I can- I can definitely see
how you do what you do.
I will. Bye.
- He's good, isn't he?
- Yeah.
Next time, you should be
a little easier on him.
Okay. But the difference is
he's my president and he's your father.
Not when he's calling
from the Oval Office, he's not.

- [ Woman ] Thank you very much.
- [ Man ] You too. Good luck.
- Mmm.
- You hate it, huh?
It tastes like freedom.
I should warn you
I'm a very slow eater.
- It's terrible on the system to rush.
- Yeah, I can see that.
So, there will be
plenty of time for discussion.
Starting with the topic of you.
Tell me something I don't know.
- Something you don't know.
- Mm-hmm.

anything about yourself.
Truthfully, one quick call
to the F.B.I. or the C.I.A...
and I can get your blood type,
third-grade class picture...
and satellite photos
of your ex-girlfriend's homes.
I guess you didn't find anything when
you were rifling through my stuff earlier.
We'll take it slow.
What is your major?
- Actuarial science.
- What actually is actuarial science?
Statistics, probability
and assessment of risk.
But more importantly,
uh, it's what my dad did.
And what his dad did.
So, that's what I'm gonna do.
Samantha.! That's them over there
across the street.!
- Come on.
- There they go. Come on!
- [ Woman Singing Slow Pop ]
- Please, Sam, one shot.
[ Continues ]
[ Man ]
Hey, is that them?
[ Camera Shutter Clicking ]
- Let's do it again.
- Just catch your breath.
Come on.
- He has a place out here too?
- [ Continues Low ]
[ Woman In Movie ]
The place used to be the gambling casino.
He likes it there
because of the memories.
- The old ancestral home, huh?
- Oh, no.
Mr. Murdock wasn't born there, but most
ofhis best friends were killed there.
You know the police used to
raid it and everything.
[ Chuckles ]
Your face.
No, no, you're all right.
The look you get.
It's like-
It's like the first time I rode my bike
without training wheels.
It's like you're experiencing
everything for the first time.
I am.
- [ Woman ] Would you like something?
- You need to try this.
Will Fats be surprised?
He's expecting us.
- I picked you up an hour early. We have lots of time.
- [ Singing Ends ]
- You get the bags. /'ll undress.
- Thank you.
- Enjoy it.
- [ Movie Dialogue Continues ]
Uh-uh.
- What are you doing?
- A chocolate snack must be poured directly over popcorn.
That way you get that delicious
salty sweet mixture...
and a little melted chocolate.
Sometimes you gotta
break the rules.
You never know when you're
gonna get something inspired.
Well, go on, Mackenzie.
Break the rules.
[ Man /n Movie ]
/f / had the strength-
Well?
It's disgusting.
I love it.
[ Movie Dialogue /ndistinct ]
- Favorite board game?
- Clue. Yours?
- Poker.
- Favorite season?
Congressional recess.
Venus or Serena?
Both. It's a trick question.
Favorite dessert?
Dinner menu Thursday.
I know I'm not supposed to say this,
but back at the White House...
my friend Joe makes
the most sensational soufflé.
Although you really haven't tasted a blintz
until you've tasted Petrovich's.
Favorite First Daughter joke?
Must be hard.
It's not so bad.
No, really.
It must be hard.
Sometimes it really is.
[ Sam ]
How do you make a tissue dance?
- [James ] No idea.
- Put a little boogie into it.
Oh, no, come on.
How do I know this wasn't
just a one-time thing?
Probably wasn't even a date.
Let's find out.
[ Breathily ]
"James, bonfire...
"Friday night.
"Be there.
Sam. "
- [ Man ] One, two, three.

Knights!
Go, Redmond!
Go, Redmond Knights!
Go, Redmond!
Go, Redmond!
Go, Redmond... Knights!
[ Cheering, Whooping ]
Redmond's in the house!
Everybody clap your hands.
Yeah, Red! Red!
Yeah, Red.! Red.!
I know you love
a good bonfire, Dylan.
Here's a tip. When you're having
a conversation with someone...
it's only polite
to let them get a word in.
[ Sam Chuckles ]
[ Man ] A lot of folks, they wanna know:
What's that one special secret...
- for getting a victory?
- Still noJames?
Who was I kidding?
He's not interested.
He was just taking pity on me.
Give the guy a little leeway.
Between your dad...
and your portable set
of Men in Black action figures...
the boy's taking on
a huge job here.
...and that's all you people.
On behalf of the Redmond Knights,
/ wanna thank each and every one of you.
What we do on the field
would not be possible...
without what you do off the field.
Are you all right?
Okay, I need backup.
I really like this guy.
What happened to all the ones you've
been kissing since school started?
When I really like a guy,
it means I'm not gonna kiss him.
All right. Long story short,
we went to school together...
and I've loved him
ever since spandex was in.
I asked him to meet me
here tonight, but...
I never thought he would.
Your offensive captain,John Young.
Give it up for big Buck Rich
on defense.
- [ Cheering ]
- Hi, Samantha.
Welcome to Redmond.
Nice to meet you.
Excuse me.
It's always about you, Sam.
Mia, wait.
Where you going?
Supposed to hang out.
Hey, I'll see you later, all right?
[ Woman Singing Hip-hop ]
[ Continues ]
So, Mia, did you talk to her
about rushing yet?
Not yet.
Hey, did you invite her to our party?
You still wanna invite her
after what happened at the last one?
Are we supposed to salute
or say the Pledge of Allegiance?
Hands off the roommate's personals.
Only I can touch 'em.
Dude, can't believe we're partying in,
like, Dorm Room One.
"Hey, Mia, what's she like?"
"Get to see her naked?"
"Can we all just stand in line
to kiss her ass?"
I'm so sick of all things Samantha.
[ Man ] Does she have a boyfriend?
She is so hot.
- [ Man #2 ] Oh,yeah.
- I don't believe that's any of your business.
[ Continues, Indistinct ]
What's going on, Mia?
What's going on is
this isn't working out.
It's too hard.
Is it that you don't like living
with all the attention, Mia?
- Or that you don't like living without it?
- Excuse me?
I think you're used to being
the center of things.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Naturally.
Normally.
What you got going on
is a whole lot of genetic limelight.
I think that you're acting
really unreasonably right now.
So why don't we just step outside.
Maybe calm down.
No, I'm not counting to 10.
I'm not writing up some itinerary.
Right here, right now,
let's have this out.
And for once, Sam,
say something that you wanna say...
and not what someone wrote for you.
Just be you.
Whoever that is.
This from a woman who will kiss
anyone with lips...
but saves abstinence for the one person
she really cares about?
Well, you know what?
At least I can admit I'm messed up.
You're so desperate to make everybody like
you, you let people use me to get to you...
and then you act like
you don't see what's happening.
You let people use you,
regardless of whether I am around, Mia.
You make that choice all of the time...
so don't blame your
genetically lit roommate.
And don't draw on my parents.
It's not nice.
[ Woman Singing Hip-hop ]
[ Fades ]
- Oh, my God.
- [ Door Slams ]
- [ Whistle Blows ]
- [ Cheerleaders, /ndistinct ]
You really shouldn't sleep
in that position.
It's bad for your neck.
I deserve it.
I'm the devil. See?
Oh, you are.
I wouldn't wanna be friends
with me either. Mm-mmm.
Reduced security or not.
I just have to face it.
My life will never be normal.
And what exactly
is so bad about that?
The last time I had privacy
I was in utero.
[ Snickers ] Imagine what it's like to have
your whole life picked out for you.
Imagine... never being alone
and always feeling lonely.
All / ever wanted
was to get my key...
get in a beat-up little Volkswagen,
and drive off to college.
You think I'm a silly, spoiled kid,
completely devoid of gratitude.
Actually, I think I completely understand
what you're going through.
- You do?
- This one time, / won the class spelling bee.
/ couldn't get from point "A'"to point "B'"
without people watching my every move.
/ had to avoid the press,
the paparazzi.
And the women.
My God, the women, Sam.
The number of training bras
that were left in my locker...
could fill the support needs
of an entire country.
So, listen, about last night.
You're my R.A.
It's forbidden.
/ get it.
It's actually not just the R.A. thing.
Oh, the other thing.
Most guys have to deal
with meeting the dad.
My dates have to charm
the commander-in-chief.
Note to fathers worldwide:
In order to keep your daughters
from getting any action...
become the president.
You were hoping to get some action?
[ Chuckles ]
You need some air?
/ think / could use a little air.
I'll just go get changed.
Come on.
Shh. Shh. Shh.
- I got your shoes. Come on.
- Oh, thank you.
[James ] My dad used to take me
to a spot like this.
He would always say that
the world was a tough place...
and you needed total self-reliance
to survive it.
He must be proud of you.
Yeah, if he was,
he definitely wouldn't say so.
Let's say you do
please your father...
and you are completely successful
and completely self-reliant...
and you know that
he's proud of you.
Then what?
It's tough to imagine, right?
Because then you'd actually
have to figure out what you want.
You've thought
about this before, huh?
Every day of my life.
Excuse me.
- Let's get back in there.
- Come on. You all right?
- How do you do that?
- What's that?
When I'm with you,
I'm just me- Sam.
I'm not
the First Daughter.
I really like it.
You're just-
So are you.
[ Giggles ]
All right then,
let's get back in there.
You lead.
[ Bell Rings ]
You beat me.
- Oh, no, I kicked your butt.
- Thanks.
- Usually people let me win.
- Sam, you will never have to worry about that with me.
Thank you.
Good.
- Will you show me how you did that?
- Mm-hmm. Excuse me.
We'll go one more time.
Just hers.
- I like your bracelet.
- Thanks.
It's from my dad.
It's one charm for every continent...
every country
and every election he won.
It's for all of our trips together.
- That's cool. Go ahead.
- Huh? Oh.
- [ Bell Rings

[ Carny ]
Come on, pitcher. Come on.!
[ Carny Continues, /ndistinct ]
For your bracelet.
Just the first of all the trips
you're gonna take on your own.
Well, this is my stop.
That's your room.
I like it.
It's nice.
Spacious for a double.
That's exactly what I said to Mia.
- Well, I had fun.
- I had fun.
All right.
Well, I guess I should-
Me too.
Well, thank you for tonight.
Good night, Samantha.
Good night.
[ Exasperated Sigh ]
James?
- Good night.
- Good night.
I know you're mad at me right now,
but I kissed him.
Oh, sorry. I'll just-
No, Sam, stay.
Really?
Yeah, really?
I really need to hang out
with my roommate tonight.
You should go.
All right.
I know I'm hard to live with.
I know you didn't
want to be my roommate.
Come with me.
- Hey.

Oh, my God. I can't believe it.
It's you! You're here in my room.

Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Mia, I need you to come with me.
I knew you'd change your mind.
Whatever you say.

Anybody up for a study break?
Okay, what's going on?
Sam?
I'm kidnapping you.
[ Mia ] Dylan. Mr. Motor Mouth.
What's up?

- Does he say anything ever?
Come on, Mia.
Please, follow me.
I can't believe I'm on Air Force One.
Now, this is a road trip.
Well, you guys have put up
with a lot from me...
and I wanted to do something special.
- And who might you be?
- This is Charles.
He's here to assist you
with anything you may want.
You mean, my every need?
My every whim?
Absolutely.
Because I can be whimsical.
- Nice equipment.
- Excuse me?
The computers.
- Can you hack into any computer in the world?
- Yes.
So that means that, uh,
it shouldn't be too hard...
to raise the credit limit
on my Neiman's account.
Marjorie is here
to help us get ready...
starting with manicures and pedicures.
And then when we land,
we'll find something to wear.

- Hi.
Every kind of game imaginable
is stacked over here.
It's my dad's own private collection.
You can sit down.
I hope this isn't too much.
No. Where we going?
It's a surprise.
This is fine. Thank you.
Can I get you something?

And isn't it a shame?
Here, on my waist.
- I need a minute alone with you.
- And I need your left hand.
- We shouldn't do this.
- Why not?
It's a free country.

Call out the National Guard.
Nothing is stopping me

Was there anybody who didn't know
except for me?
I feel so humiliated.
Do you know that every day I get...
at least a half a dozen threats
against you- every day?
As your father, I couldn't live with myself
if something ever happened to you.
As a president...
this country can't afford to have
anything happen to you right now.
What could I do, Sam?
What choice did I have?
You had the choice
to be honest with me.
You had the choice not to lie to me-
as my father and as the president.
[ Sighs, Quietly ]
Oh, man.
Hon, I know you thought
he was your friend.
If you want, [ Inhales ]
we can replace him.
Won't he lose his job?
He'll be transferred
from First Family detail, but no.
No- Find another position.
But not the right position.
He's in line to work for me.
And, yeah, that's where most agents
want to end up.
No. He can stay.
I really hope someday
you understand this.
I do.
That is what is so disappointing.
I thought I'd finally found someone
who'd like me for me.
So how do you know his feelings
for you weren't real?
- He was just doing his job.
- [ Chuckles ] That's crap. He wanted you.
Watch. Go back and act
like nothing happened.
Better yet, date somebody.
There's nothing a man wants
more than something he can't have.

Would you stop it?
Just stop lying to me.
What could I have given you, Sam?
I don't have anything to offer you.
You're the president's daughter,
for Chrissake.
I've spent...
almost my entire life
with people smiling at me...
and laughing at my jokes
and telling me how special I am...
and how great I am
and how nice and smart.
And right now I don't know
if any of that was true.
Maybe it was all some kind
of an act. / don't know.
What if I was different? What if
I was just like everybody else,James?
How would you feel about me then?
You just don't get it.
Things aren't different.
What if they were?
/ think you owe me at least this.
Forget image.
[ Sighs ]
Forget politics. Forget-
Forget everything else

Well, the question on my mind,
Samantha, is:
What have you been doing here?
- [ Door Closes ]
- Been a three-point drop in the polls...
since your little table dance.
Is it that bad?
You've gotta know that we are
in the race of our lives.
We were elected to set an example.
They expect more of us.
That's the life we've chosen.
I didn't choose anything, Mom.
And I didn't run for anything.
Nobody elected me, remember?
Like it or not, chosen or not...
you are the daughter
of the president of the United States.
Your father and I need you.
Now, we need to be the First Family.
You want me to leave school?

"Warren, I got you the presidency.
Now what are you gonna do with it?"

Good evening, miss.
I guess you heard,
Samantha Mackenzie raising money...
for her dad's reelection
one dollar at a time.
[ Laughter, Applause ] Yes, ladies and gentlemen. That's
- That's the big story.
Here's the best part.
The Secret Service agent...
who knocked out the guy at the bar
where Samantha was stripping-
Turns out, that Secret Service agent
is her boyfriend.
- [ Fades ]
- [ Audience ] Ooh.!
And with the help of hard workin' people
like you, we can win this thing.
- Thank you, Motor City!
- [ Cheering ]
[ Chanting ] Mackenzie.!
Mackenzie.! [ Continues ]
[ Man ] We're here to discuss your proposed
removal as a disciplinary action.
Your record is exceptional,
but looking at this report...
I have my doubts about your ability
to continue as an agent.
I understand.
So please tell this panel why we should
allow you to continue as an agent.
My father was an agent.
- And my grandfather was before- - But they're
not the ones under review here. You are.
And if you had a different father or
grandfather, you wouldn't have this opportunity.
You know, as a little kid...
I always dreamt about standing on the
sidelines of history, protecting others-
maybe even the president himself.
Well, I had the opportunity
to protect a pretty remarkable person.
Do you have anything to say
to defend your actions?
You trained me
to expect the unexpected.
And I tried... not to feel anything.
I tried to keep my distance...
but I...
fell deeper... and deeper.
/fhaving those feelings
means losing myjob...
then that's a loss
I am prepared to take.
You and I know that mistakes made in our
line of work could mean someone's life.
So I'm sorry.
You'll be on suspension
pending your removal...
and you should start to think
about other alternatives.
- [ Staff Members Chattering Low ]
- [ Man ]... his humor, his charisma.
[ Woman ]
Have we confirmed these numbers?
- [ Chatter Continues ]
- And did she sign for them?
- Well, the only thing-
- Well, that's why we chose this venue.
- New Hampshire worked, right?
- We're not in New Hampshire anymore.
- Most people want to hear about foreign markets.
- Pardon me.
- Hey. How are you doin'?
- Good.
You okay?
Sam...
you're unhappy.
I get it. But if you're going
to be here, be here.
Because there's a lot at stake...
and I really need you to act
like a grown-up right now.
Obviously, I understand
there is a lot at stake, Dad.
I have been standing by your side
with Mom my entire life.
That's why I came home.
You don't have to tell me how important
it is to be with the people you love.
I am here. If you want me to be
a grown-up, then you have to allow it.
[ Tapping On Microphone, Feedback ]
- What's goin' on with Sam?
- Uh-
- What is it?
- Well...
remember when she was little
and she found that frog...
and we wouldn't let her keep it...
and she got that really stubborn little...
unbelievably cute look on her face?
- Yes.
- She just made that face again.
Man. Here I am about to go onstage-
she puts her old man in his place.
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.
And?
And, uh-
- I dunno. Good for her.
- [ Man ] Will someone get the president?
- [ Woman ] It's time to go, Mr. President.
- Ready?
Let's go.
[ Woman On Speaker ] And as for our
president, he's gonna do the same thing...
- to this country that she's done to her
family- embarrass it. - [ Switch Clicks ]
[ Press Secretary ] With all due respect,
now that we'vejust taken direct hits...
on the domestic agenda, and it's
the last push before the election-
It's too late to change our position.
I don't think we should address it.
What do you think, Sam?
- I don't really have an opinion, Dad.
- Really?
Are you sure?
Well, I don't know what could be
more important than home.
[ Press Secretary ] Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.
- [ Applause ]
- Thanks.
[ Applause Continues, Stops ]
- [ Woman ] Mr. President.
- [ Man ] Mr. President.
Afternoon, folks.
[ Water Splashing ]
Thought you might want a snack.
Made it myself.
- Dad.
- Okay, I had that cake made myself.
How are you doin'?
- Dad?
- Yeah.
I need you to make sure
thatJames is okay.
He's a good agent.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
Did you love him?
I loved who I got to be with him.
Even though I didn't do
anything amazing, for me it was.
/ felt like /...
knew myself for the first time.
Love?
That too.
That's what I thought.
[ Man ] And-
reelected to a second term-
- PresidentJohn Mackenzie.
- [ Audience Cheering ]
- Thank you very much. God bless the U.S.A.
- [ Man #2 ] We love you, Mac.!
- [ Cheering Continues ]
- [ Band: "Hail To The Chief"]
Recently, this...
really fine young woman...
pointed out to me
the importance of home.
And, uh, for the next four years,
this administration...
is going to find its way
back there, starting now.
- Thank you.
- [ Applause ]
[ Dance Band:Swing ]
[ Whispers ]
It's your time.
[ Continues ]
- The next dance is for you and me.
- Okay.
What do you think of your father's
policies now, Samantha?
I have my own policies to think about.
[ Man And Chorus Singing Swing ]
[ Continues ]
- It was a nice speech.
- Thanks.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Both Chuckle ]
Dad, one thing you always taught me...
was to make sure that I'm always at home,
no matter what anyone else thinks.
It has to include you.
We all deserve a second chance.
It's okay.
[James ]
Give me your left hand.
What are you doing?
Dancing with you.
On my shoulder.
We shouldn't. We can't.
Try not to lead this time, okay?
[ Band Continues ]
[ Man And Chorus Resume ]
[ Chuckling Softly ]
[ Both Chuckling ]
[ Ends ]
[ Applause ]
I, uh...
believe this is yours.
It'll take you on your next trip.
Even included the cooler.
We did everything
to your exact specifications.
- Thank you,James.
- Thank you.
Bye, Sam.
Now, go try to break a few rules, huh?
- You try to keep some.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Forget something?
- Yeah.
I just forgot my purse.
- Take good care of him.
- I will.
Just getting back on duty now.
I'm just getting off duty now.
- I hear she'll be home for spring break.
- Hmm?
Just so you know.
- [ Sighs ]
- You ready to stand on the sidelines of history?
Yeah. You?
- POTUS moving.
- Yeah.
Just make sure you don't fall in love
with this one.
[ Engine Starts ]
[ Narrator ] Once upon a time,
underneath the magic of the night sky...
a brazen little girl grew up
in a white house.
- /t wasn't until she left that
house, however- - [ Releases Brake ]
that she truly found home.
College-bound till spring, she'll be back
when the cherry blossoms bloom again.
With romance in the air,
James will be there.
But that's another story.
