What's your name again?
Chrissie.
Where are we going?
Swimming.
Slow up. Slow down.
I'm not drunk! Slow down!
Wait. I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I'm definitely coming.
Whoa.
Hold on. Whoa!
I can swim.
I just can't walk
or undress myself.
Come on in the water!
Take it easy.
Oh, God, help!
Please help me!
I'm coming.
It hurts!
<i>...local fishing reported good.</i>
<i>Amity Boat Rental Yard's
opening early</i>
<i>to prepare for the
annual seasonal rush.</i>
<i>This is WISS...</i>
How come the sun
didn't use to shine in here?
We bought the house in the fall,
and this is summer.
Somebody feed the dogs.
Right.
Do you see the kids?
They must be in the back yard.
In Amity you say "yard."
They're in the "yard,"
not too "far" from the "car."
How's that?
Like you're from New York.
Mum, I got cut.
I got hit by a vampire.
You were playing on those swings,
weren't you?
Those swings are dangerous.
Stay off there.
I haven't fixed them yet.
I think you're going to live.
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.
- Yes.
- Can I go swimming?
Yeah, but let me clean
this thing off first.
What do they usually do?
Wash up, or float up, or what?
Oh, no.
Keep them there.
I'll be out in about
15, 20 minutes. All right?
- Dry you off.
- Okay.
Go on, get a Band-Aid.
Got to go. Missing person.
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.
Listen, Chief...
be careful, will you?
In this town?
Hi, Dad.
Wait a minute.
Let me get on.
I want my cup back!
You'll get it.
Wave goodbye. Bye.
Nobody saw her go into the water?
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.
You mean, she ran out on you?
No, sir.
She must've drowned.
Look, I reported it to you,
didn't I?
You live here?
No. Hartford.
I go to Trinity.
My folks live in Greenwich.
Your folks were born here, right?
Yeah, I'm an Islander.
They moved off when my dad retired.
You an Islander?
No. New York City.
You here for the summer?
Come on.
Hold it.
Oh, Jesus.
Well, you're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?
Chief, what have you got on?
If this new filing system is to work,
you must keep outdated stuff
off my desk.
- Just the pending, all right?
- Yes, Chief.
We got a bunch of calls
about that karate school.
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been
karate-ing the picket fences.
Chief Brody's office.
The medical inspector.
The Fire Chief wants you
to go over the Fourth of July...
Polly, I want a list
of the water activities
that the city fathers
are planning for today.
- Right away.
- Hendricks!
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?
- We never had any.
- No?
There's a dead truck with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.
Look what the kids did to my fence.
8 and 9-year-olds...
- Glasses?
- Yeah, glasses.
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.
This stuff ain't going
to help me in August.
The summer ginks
come down here in June.
You haven't got one thing on
here I ordered.
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger, no beach balls.
If I can't get service...
Chief, Polly sent me to tell you
that there's a bunch of Boy Scouts
out in Avril Bay
doing the mile swim
for their merit badges.
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.
Okay. Come on,
get out of there.
Take this stuff
back to the office
and get to work on those signs.
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."
Let Polly do the printing.
What's the matter with my printing?
Let Polly do the printing.
Chief Brody!
What have you got there?
Listen, we had a shark attack
at South Beach this morning, Mayor.
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.
Charlie, take me out to those kids,
will you?
Martin, you're going to shut down the beaches
on your own authority?
What other authority do I need?
Technically, you need a civic ordinance
or a resolution by a board of...
That's just going by the book.
We're really a little anxious
that you're rushing
into something serious here.
This is your first summer, you know.
What does that mean?
I'm only trying to say that Amity
is a summer town.
We need summer dollars.
If they can't swim here
they'll be glad to swim
at the beaches
of Cape Cod, the Hamptons,
Long Island.
That doesn't mean we serve them
a smorgasbord.
But we've never had that kind of trouble
in these waters.
What else could've done that
to that girl?
A boat propeller?
I think possibly, yes,
a boating accident.
That's not what you told me
on the phone.
I was wrong.
We'll have to amend our reports.
And you'll stand by that?
I'll stand by that.
Martin, a summer girl goes swimming,
swims out a little far.
She tires,
fishing boat comes along...
It's happened before.
I don't think you appreciate
the gut reaction
people have to these things.
Larry, I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.
Martin, it's all psychological.
You yell, "Barracuda!"
And everybody says, "Huh? What?"
You yell, "Shark!"...
we've got a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.
Okay. You can take us back now.
Here's mommy, here.
I'm going to get my raft
and go back out in the water.
Let me see your fingers.
Alex Kintner,
they're beginning to prune.
Just let me go out a little longer.
Just 10 more minutes.
Thanks.
There are no Islanders.
None of them are from the island.
It's just a big bother.
They're bringing in...
All I want to know...
I just want to know
one simple thing.
When do I get to become an Islander?
Ellen, never.
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander. That's it.
<i>Nantucket Ferries...</i>
<i>to Amity, Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket islands.</i>
<i>Monday to Thursday,
8:40, 1:15, 5:45 and 6:00 p.m.</i>
<i>Starting July 1, 8:30 p.m...</i>
Come back here.
- But don't bother him. Come right back.
- Okay. I won't.
Martin, I know you got
a lot of problems downtown
but I've got problems at the house
I wish you'd take care of.
One, I've got some cats parking
in front of the house,
I can't get...
And that garbage truck next to the office,
that's terrible.
What I need is a red zone.
It's a simple thing you can take care of.
- You've done it before.
- Come here a minute, please.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Listen, if the kids going in the water
is worrying you
they can play out here on the beach.
It's all right.
Let them go.
It's cold.
We know all about you, Chief.
You don't go in the water
at all, do you?
That's some bad hat, Harry.
Chief Brody, you are uptight.
Come on. That's it.
<i>Oh, do you know the muffin man</i>
<i>The muffin man</i>
Tippet!
Did you see that?
Blood!
Everybody out!
Get them out!
Michael, get out of the water!
Alex?
We don't even know
if there's a shark around here.
I can't argue with you.
I can't talk to you.
I have to talk to Mrs. Kintner.
Because this is turning into a contest.
It's not just the Gazette.
She's advertising in out-of-town papers.
I suggest we move back to council chambers
where we'll have more room.
I'm responsible for public safety here.
Then go out tomorrow
and see that no one gets hurt.
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.
The ad will run on the back
along with the grocery ads.
Right in here, please.
Move on in, please.
Why do you insist
on playing the heavy?
I have a point of view and I think
it speaks for many of the people here.
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?
Let's have some order.
Let's have order, please.
Any special questions?
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark
in cash or check?
I don't think that's funny.
I don't think that's funny at all.
All right.
That's private business
between you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
Martin, would you please...
Chief Brody.
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.
What about the beaches, Chief?
We're going to put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.
And then we're going to try
and use shark spotters on the beach.
Are you going to close the beaches?
Yes, we are.
We also plan to bring in experts
from the Oceanographic Institute
on the mainland.
Only 24 hours.
I didn't agree to that.
Only 24 hours.
Twenty-four hours
is like three weeks!
You all know me.
Know how I earn a living.
I'll catch this bird for you.
It ain't going to be easy.
Bad fish.
Not like going down to the pond
and chasing bluegills or tommy cods.
This shark, swallow you whole.
Shaking, tenderizing.
Down you go.
And we got to do it quick.
Got to bring back the tourists
that'll put all your businesses
on a paying basis.
But it's not going to be pleasant.
I value my neck
a lot more than $3,000, Chief.
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.
You got to make up your minds.
Gonna stay alive and ante up,
gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare the whole winter.
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.
There's too many captains
on this island.
$10,000 for me, by myself.
For that, you get the head, the tail,
the whole damn thing.
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.
We'll take it under advisement.
Mr. Mayor, Chief,
ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, God, you scared me.
You know, Ellen, people don't even know
how old sharks are.
I mean, if they live 2,000, 3,000 years...
They don't know.
Enough.
You're not going to even be able
to go to sleep tonight.
Here. Come on.
Thanks.
Want to get drunk
and fool around?
Oh, yeah.
Mikey really loves his present.
Where is he?
Sitting in it.
Good God.
All right, Michael,
out of the boat!
Tied up to the jetties,
sitting in the boat.
I'm helping Michael.
Get out of that boat!
Hi, Dad.
Just a little longer. Please?
It's his birthday.
I don't want him on the ocean!
He's not on the ocean,
he is in a boat.
He won't go in the water.
I don't think he'll go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.
All right, now don't say that.
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.
I want him to read
the boating regulations,
the rules, before he goes out
on his own.
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!
Now!
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.
Don't worry. The Chief lives
on the other side of the island.
Am I coming in straight?
Don't worry about it.
Just keep rowing.
We better catch something,
this is my wife's holiday roast.
Don't worry about it.
$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.
Come and get it.
The tide's taking it right out.
Can't we go home?
He's taking it.
Go!
Charlie, take my word for it,
don't look back!
Swim, Charlie!
Come on! To me, boy!
Come on, Charlie! Swim!
Come on, Charlie, keep coming.
Keep swimming.
Come on, a little more.
Atta boy.
I can't get up.
Give me your hand, Charlie.
Help me!
Get your feet out of the water!
Can we go home now?
So then Denherder and Charlie sat there
trying to catch their breath
and figure out
how to tell Charlie's wife
what happened to her freezer
full of meat.
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad
in <i>Field & Stream.</i>
Looks more like
<i>The National Enquirer.</i>
All right, hold it. Hold everything.
I said, hold it!
Hello.
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?
Say, I hope you're not going out
with those nuts, are you?
The Weetock boats
gotta move out first.
You have to move out
or he can't get out at all.
Don't raise sail, you're going to luff it.
You got a paddle?
- I got a paddle.
- Scull it out of here.
Officer, wait a second.
How many guys are you going
to put aboard that boat?
Whatever's safe, right?
Yeah, well that ain't safe.
Watch it, that's dynamite.
What are you doing with that?
Where are you going with that?
I'm going on the boat.
Please, help me get those guys
out of the boat, will you?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Gentlemen, the officer asked me
to tell you
that you're overloading that boat!
Go on, get out of here.
You ain't going.
What do you care?
Can you tell me if there's
a good restaurant or hotel on the island?
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.
They're all going to die.
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.
You've got to get somebody to help us.
Yeah, get those road block signs
out on the highway.
Because we've got more people down here
than we can handle.
What're you doing there?
These are your people. Go talk to them.
They aren't my people.
They're from all over.
You see all the license plates?
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey.
I'm all by myself out there.
What happened to the extra help...
It's not until the Fourth of July.
Till then, it's you and me.
You know those guys
in the fan-tail launch?
None of them are getting out
of the harbor alive.
That's what I'm saying.
You know their names.
Talk to those clowns.
Everyone's having a good time today.
Tell me about it.
Polly, I'll get back to you.
Could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?
Who are you?
Matt Hooper. I'm from
the Oceanographic Institute.
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
You're the guy we called. I'm Brody.
- Oh. I'm glad to meet you.
- Me, too.
I know you got a lot on your hands.
What can we do for you?
The best thing to do
is to see the remains
of the first victim,
the girl on the beach.
Okay, fine.
Just bear with me, will you?
Sure.
Wait till we get them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.
There'll be some fun.
They'll wish their fathers
hadn't met their mothers
when they start digging
the bottoms out
and slamming into them rocks, boy.
Get away from there,
you goddamn fool!
What's the matter with you?
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?
What are these guys
doing out here?
What are they doing back there?
They're chumming right now.
What the hell is that?
They're tracking the shark.
$3,000 divided four ways is what?
Watch your starboard. Jesus!
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.
"Victim identified as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian."
And here's the way we have it.
"Probable boating accident."
The height and weight of the victim
can only be estimated
from the partial remains.
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.
There are no major organs remaining.
May I have a glass of water?
The right arm has been severed
above the elbow
with massive tissue loss
in the upper musculature.
Thank you very much.
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.
Did you notify
the Coast Guard about this?
No. It was only local jurisdiction.
The left arm, head,
the shoulders, sternum
and portions of the rib cage
are intact.
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.
This is what happens.
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding
of a large <i>squalus</i>
possibly <i>longimanus</i> or <i>Isurus glaucus.</i>
The enormous amount of tissue loss
prevents any detailed analysis
however, the attacking <i>squalus</i>
must be considerably larger
than any normal <i>squalus</i>
found in these waters.
Didn't you get out a boat
and check these waters?
No.
Well, this is not a boat accident.
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.
It was a shark.
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I want to get on the state wire services.
See if Boston will pick it up
and go national.
Call Dave Axelrod in New York
and tell him he owes me a favor.
This is the shot I want with everybody
and the fish in it.
Guys, could we please get organized?
I want to get a picture for the paper.
Now, can we just have the...
Ben Gardner get this?
No, we caught it.
That's swell.
It's a beauty.
Guys, please,
I need a picture for the paper.
Clear out of the way, please.
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.
Come on.
I need a picture for the paper.
Could we get the sign, please?
Kneel down, just like in high school.
One row kneeling, one row standing.
Come on, just get out of the way.
Young fellow, could you step out
of the picture?
Take your rake with you.
- We're ready.
- Thank you.
Can you get that, please.
How's that?
Larry, you won't believe it.
What kind of a shark is that?
I don't know.
I think it's a mako.
It's got a deep throat, Frank.
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?
Tiger shark.
A what?
We can start breathing again.
Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?
Oh, you bet he is.
What is this bite radius crap?
That is a big mouth.
You stuff your frigging head
in there, man,
and find out if it's a man-eater.
All I'm saying is
that it may not be the shark.
It's just a slight...
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.
Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.
Nice to meet you.
Terrific, huh, Mayor?
There are all kinds of sharks
in the waters.
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.
And the chances that these bozos
got the exact shark...
There are no other sharks
like this here.
It's 100-to-1.
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.
But the fact is,
the bite radius on this animal
is different than the wounds
on the victim.
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.
We all want to be sure, okay?
What I want to do is very simple.
The digestive system of this animal
is very slow.
Let's cut it open.
Whatever it's eaten
in the last 24 hours
is bound to still be in there.
And then we'll be sure.
It may be the only way to confirm it.
Look, fellows, let's be reasonable.
This is not the time or the place
to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.
And I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open
and see that little Kintner boy
spill out all over the dock.
Chief Brody?
Yes?
I just found out
that a girl got killed here last week.
And you knew it.
You knew there was a shark out there.
You knew it was dangerous.
But you let people
go swimming anyway.
You knew all those things,
but still my boy is dead now.
And there's nothing
you can do about it.
My boy is dead.
I wanted you to know that.
I'm sorry, Martin.
She's wrong.
No, she's not.
All right, fellows
let's cut this ugly
son of a bitch down
before it stinks up
the whole island.
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.
Come here.
Give us a kiss.
Why?
Because I need it.
Get out of here.
Can I help you?
The door was open.
Mind if I come in?
I'm Matt Hooper.
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
- Your husband's home?
- Yes.
I'd really like to talk to him.
Yes, so would I.
Come in.
Can I get you some coffee?
No. Nothing, thank you.
Oh, wine. How nice.
How was your day?
Swell.
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.
Oh, that's nice.
Is anyone eating this?
No.
My husband tells me
you're in sharks.
Excuse me. Yes.
I've never heard it quite put that way.
But yes, I am.
I love sharks.
You love sharks?
Yeah, I love them.
When I was 12 years old,
my father got me a boat
and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.
I hooked a scup and
as I was reeling it in
I hooked a 4.5 foot baby thresher shark
who proceeded to eat my boat.
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.
He turned an inboard
into an outboard
scared me to death,
and I swam back to shore.
When I was on the beach,
I turned around
and actually saw my boat
being taken apart.
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks
and that's why I know that I'm going
to go to the Institute tomorrow
and tell them that you still have
a shark problem here.
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- Sorry.
I'm sorry, I thought that...
You told me the shark was caught.
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.
They caught a shark,
not the shark.
Not the shark that killed
Chrissie Watkins.
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.
Which I wanted to prove today
by cutting the shark open...
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.
You know, you'll be
the only rational man
left on this island
after I leave tomorrow.
Where are you going?
I am going on the <i>Aurora.</i>
The <i>Aurora?</i> What is that?
It's a floating asylum
for shark addicts.
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.
Martin sits in his car
when we go on the ferry to the mainland.
I guess it's a childhood thing.
There's a clinical name for it,
isn't there?
Drowning.
Is it true that most people get attacked
by sharks in three feet of water
about 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah.
And that before people
started to swim for recreation...
I mean, before sharks knew
what they were missing
that a lot of these attacks
weren't reported?
That's right.
Now this shark that swims alone
- what's it called?
- Rogue.
Rogue, yeah.
This guy, he keeps swimming around
in a place where the feeding is good
until the food supply is gone, right?
That's called territoriality.
It's just a theory that
I happen to agree with.
Then why don't we have
one more drink
and go down
and cut that shark open?
Martin? Can you do that?
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.
We start in the alimentary canal
and open the digestive tract.
Just like I thought.
What?
Came up in the Gulf Stream,
from southern waters.
He didn't eat a car, did he?
No.
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.
Somebody probably threw that
in the river.
That's it.
I've got to close the beach,
call the Mayor.
You got a bigger problem than that, Martin.
You still got a hell of a fish out there
with a mouth about this big.
How do we confirm that by morning?
If he is a rogue,
and there's any truth to territoriality at all
we got a good chance of spotting him
between Cape Scott and South Beach.
Where are you going?
To find him.
He's a night feeder.
On the water?
We're not gonna find him on the land.
I'm not drunk enough
to go on a boat.
Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.
I'm telling you, the crime rate in New York
will kill you.
There's so many problems,
you never feel like you're accomplishing anything.
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.
The kids can't leave the house.
You've got to walk them to school.
But in Amity,
one man can make a difference.
In 25 years, there's never been
a shooting or a murder in this town.
No kidding? Want a pretzel?
Where are we?
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.
Can you get <i>The Late Show</i>
on this thing?
No, it's a closed circuit TV system.
I have underwater cameras fore-and-aft.
Who pays for all this stuff?
The government? The Institute?
This stuff costs a lot of money.
I paid for this mostly myself, actually.
- You're kidding.
- No.
- You rich?
- Yeah.
How much?
Personally, or the whole family?
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?
Well, it doesn't make sense for a guy
who hates the water
to live on an island either.
It's only an island
if you look at it from the water.
That makes a lot of sense.
What is that thing doing?
Well, it's a fish finder.
It's probably just
a school of mackerel or something,
all clumped together.
Wait a minute.
There's something else out there.
What is it?
About 100 yards, south-southwest.
That's Ben Gardner's boat.
You know him?
It's all banged up.
Sure I know him. He's a fisherman.
What happened?
Martin, I gotta go down
and check their hull.
Wait. Why don't we just tow it all in?
We will.
I just got to check something out.
Hit the lights for me.
Let's tow it in.
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's going to happen.
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Don't touch any of the equipment.
I'll be back in two minutes.
This is a great white, Larry.
A big one.
Any shark expert will tell you
it's a killer, a man-eater.
The situation is that apparently
a great white shark
has staked a claim
in the waters off Amity Island.
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food in the water.
There's no limit
to what he'll do.
We've had three incidents.
Two people killed within a week.
It'll happen again.
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.
Tell him about the swimmers.
A shark is attracted to the exact kind
of splashing and activity
that occurs whenever human beings swim.
You can't avoid it.
Opening the beaches on the Fourth of July
is like ringing the dinner bell.
Look, Mr. Vaughn
I pulled a tooth
the size of a shot glass
out of the wrecked hull
of a boat out there.
It was the tooth of a great white.
It was Gardner's boat, all chewed up.
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?
I didn't see it.
He dropped it on the way in.
I had an accident.
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?
It's a <i>Carcharodon carcharias.</i>
It's a great white.
You don't have the tooth?
Look, we depend on the summer people
for our very lives...
You won't have a summer
unless you deal with this problem!
We have to close the beach
and hire someone to kill the shark!
We have to tell the Coast Guard.
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.
You'll have to ring
this entire harbor!
I don't think either one of you
are familiar with our problems!
I think that I am familiar
with the fact
that you'll ignore
this particular problem
until it swims up
and bites you in the ass!
Wait a second!
There are two ways to deal with this problem!
You either kill this animal
or cut off its food supply.
We have to close the beaches.
Brody?
Sick vandalism.
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.
I want those little
paint-happy bastards caught
and hung up by their Buster Browns.
That's it. I won't waste my time
arguing with a man
who's lining up to be a hot lunch.
I'm gonna see you later, Brody.
Don't do this. He's not...
What we are dealing with here
is a perfect engine, an eating machine.
It's really a miracle of evolution.
All this machine does
is swim and eat
and make little sharks.
And that's all.
Why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign?
Those proportions are correct.
You'd love to prove that,
wouldn't you?
Get your name into the
<i>National Geographic.</i>
Larry, if we make an effort today,
we might be able to save August.
August? For Christ's sake,
tomorrow's the Fourth of July!
We will be open for business.
It'll be one of the best summers
we've ever had.
If you are concerned
about the beaches,
do whatever you have to,
to make them safe.
But those beaches will be open
for this weekend.
I want to know how many men
you're going to send.
There is no need for me
to come to Brisbane
when I have a great white shark
right here!
<i>We need men to patrol
the swimming area.</i>
<i>We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.</i>
Monday!
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?
He's the little guy
with a crew cut.
Operator, isn't there a phone
on the island?
Could you connect me, please?
Come on, get him!
Careful on the beach.
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.
All right.
I'll get to them later.
Brody to Scutbucket,
please come in.
Brody to Daisy,
do you read me?
<i>Fascinating Rhythm,
do you read me?</i>
<i>Come in, Hooper.
What do you see?</i>
Nothing here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.
Amity Island has long been known
for its clean air, clear water
and beautiful white-sand beaches.
But in recent days
a cloud has appeared on the horizon
of this beautiful resort community.
A cloud in the shape
of a killer shark.
<i>That is very shocking
in the outfield.</i>
<i>Two balls, one strike,
runners at first and third...</i>
<i>Fly ball, deep left field.</i>
<i>Jerry Christian goes back,
running back near the wall</i>
<i>and he takes it for the out.</i>
Oh, hi, Larry.
Why aren't you in the water?
I just put some suntan lotion on,
and I'm trying to absorb some...
Nobody's going in.
Please, get in the water.
Mike, come here.
Listen, Mike.
Do me a favor, will you?
You and the other guys
take the boat
and put it in the pond instead?
The pond is for old ladies.
I know it's for the old ladies,
but just do it for the old man.
Please?
All right.
Thanks.
I've got Sean.
Michael! Wait!
Michael, I don't like you no more.
I can stand Harry, you know...
Daisy, this is Hendricks.
Anything?
Thought I saw a shadow. Over.
<i>Hendricks, this is Daisy here.
I don't see anything.</i>
False alarm.
Must be this glare.
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news
that we have in fact
caught and killed a large predator
that supposedly injured some bathers.
As you see,
it's a beautiful day.
The beaches are open,
and people are having a wonderful time.
"Amity," as you know,
means "friendship."
My God!
Jesus Christ!
Fin! Shark! 350!
<i>Get in there as fast as you can!</i>
Red one.
<i>Martin, get them
the hell out of the water.</i>
No whistles!
<i>Everybody, please,
get out of the water.</i>
<i>Everybody out of the water.</i>
<i>Don't push!
Everybody out of the water, please.</i>
Come on!
<i>I want them out of there, guys.</i>
<i>Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?</i>
He made me do it.
He talked me into it.
Please, move back.
Give these people some air.
Please, move back.
Martin, it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.
Is everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?
<i>Folks, we had some practical joker
down there with a fake fin...</i>
Shark! A shark!
It's going into the pond!
Shark in estuary!
Now what?
Michael's in the pond.
It's going in the pond!
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!
Hurry up, get that done.
I can't do a damn thing.
Get that rope undone.
You gotta untangle that up there.
I'm doing it!
Hey, fellows, haul in your sheet.
Make it fast.
You guys okay over there?
In the pond!
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!
Doesn't anybody have a gun?
Is he dead?
No, he's not. He's in shock.
Doctor said he's okay.
Mild shock.
He can go home in the morning.
Thank you.
How's my big kid?
I'm all right.
You going to miss me tonight?
You can watch television.
Want me to bring anything from home?
My cars.
What about ice cream?
Coffee.
Want to take him home?
Back to New York?
No. Home, here.
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.
You got a pen, Larry?
Yeah, a pen, you know.
'Cause you're going to do
what you do best.
You're going to sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.
I don't know
if I can do that without...
I'm going to hire Quint
to kill the shark.
- August?
- What?
What are you talking about?
Summer's over.
You're the mayor of Shark City.
People think you want the beaches open.
I was acting in
the town's best interest.
You were acting in
the town's best interest.
That's why you'll do the right thing.
That's why you're going to sign this,
and we'll pay that guy
what he wants.
My kids were on that beach, too.
Sign it, Larry.
<i>$10,000.</i>
<i>$200 a day,
whether I catch him or not.</i>
<i>You've got it.</i>
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more of this zoning crap.
You've got that.
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.
Champagne, <i>pâte de foie gras,</i>
Iranian caviar,
and don't forget the color TV.
Chief, you try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.
Thanks.
Here's to swimming
with bow-legged women.
Excuse me, Chief.
Can't get a good man these days,
under 60.
All gone at least 35 years.
Don't drink that.
Mr. Quint...
You're gonna need an extra hand.
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know who he is.
I've crewed three Trans Pacs.
Transplants?
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
And an America's Cup trial.
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talking
about pleasure boating
or day-sailing.
I'm talking about working for a living.
I'm talking about sharking.
I'm not talking about hooking
some poor dogfish or sand shark.
I'm talking about finding a great white.
Porkers? Talking about porkers?
Just tie me a sheepshank.
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship
in a long time.
You didn't say how short you wanted it.
How's that?
Give me your hands.
Dogfish?
You got a $5,000 net
and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.
Along comes Mr. Whitey,
and when he's finished with that net
it looks like a kiddies' scissors class
has cut it up for a paper doll.
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.
You been counting money
all your life.
I don't need this.
I don't need this working-class-hero crap.
You're not going to do this aboard the ship
are you, Mr. Quint?
Maybe I should go alone.
It's my party. It's my charter.
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party.
It's my vessel.
You're on board my vessel,
I'm mate, master, pilot
and I'm captain.
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.
You got him.
"Straight-jet, killing lance.
"Tail rope, eye splice, M-1,
handy billy, pliers, irons..."
Sample bottles, dye marker,
flares, safety float
temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure, all right?
Jesus H. Christ!
When I was a boy,
every squirt wanted
to be a harpooner
or a swordfisherman.
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?
An anti-shark cage.
Anti-shark cage?
You go inside the cage?
Cage goes in the water? You go in the water?
Shark's in the water.
Our shark.
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>
<i>For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston</i>
<i>And so nevermore
shall we see you again</i>
Did you take your Dramamine?
Yes.
I put an extra pair of glasses
in your black socks
and there's the stuff
for your nose,
the zinc oxide and Blistex
is in the kit.
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothing.
Young girls just ain't quite smart
like their grandmothers were.
That's got to be Quint.
Colorful, isn't he?
He scares me.
Don't use the fireplace in the den...
What am I going
to tell the kids?
Tell them I'm going fishing.
Break it up, will you, Chief?
Daylight's wasting!
Front, bow. Back, stern.
Better get it right, squirt,
or I throw your ass
out the little round window
on the side!
Come on, Chief.
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.
See you got your rubbers.
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee
Died at the age of 103
"For 15 years she kept her virginity
"Not a bad record for this vicinity"
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt!
If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow!
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
Stand by fire drill.
Damage control report.
Nor'easter coming,
bad news for Madison Avenue.
I'm tired of that.
How's the missus, Chief?
If they don't like you going out,
they'll love you coming in.
Keep that chum line going, Chief.
We got five good miles on it.
Who's driving this boat?
Nobody. The tide.
One time, I caught
a 16-footer off Montauk.
Had to stick two barrels in him.
Two to wear him down
and bring him up.
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.
Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.
Jesus H. Christ.
Chief, best drop another chum marker.
Damn it, Martin!
This is compressed air.
What the hell kind of a knot was that?
You pulled the wrong one!
You screw around with these tanks,
and they're going to blow up.
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear
you've brought out here, Mr. Hooper.
I don't know what that bastard shark's
going to do with it.
Might eat it, I suppose.
Seen one eat a rocking chair one time.
Next time, you just ask me
which line to pull, right?
Little brown eel
comes out of the cave
swims into the hole
comes out of the hole,
goes back into the cave again.
It's not too good, is it?
Nothing's easy, is it?
One more time.
Little brown eel...
I got it!
- What?
- Get behind me.
Hooper, reverse her!
Taking a hell of a lot of line!
Chief, get the scoop out of the bucket!
Wet the reel!
Hooper, reverse her!
Duck your head down. We're swinging.
Get behind me again.
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watching it!
Hooper, neutral.
Where'd he go now?
He ain't fooling me.
What's he yanking on now?
Go on, try it.
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart or very dumb.
Jesus...
He's gone under.
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.
Yeah, it's too easy.
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.
Keep her steady, now.
I got something very big!
I don't think so.
Chief, put your gloves on.
You put your gloves on,
both of you!
Getting ready to run out again.
Quint, let it go.
Maybe you're a big yahoo in the lab,
but out here
you're just supercargo!
If you don't want to backstroke home,
you get down here!
You don't want to listen to me,
don't listen to me.
It's not a shark.
The wire's showing.
Unbuckle me.
Get the other side.
It's a tuna or swordfish
wasting our time.
Take this rod.
Hooper, give the Chief a hand,
will you?
Right!
Oh, shit!
It may be a marlin or a stingray
but it's definitely a game fish.
Gaming fish?
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?
Don't you tell me
my business again.
You get back on the bridge.
Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.
It proves one thing, Mr. Hooper.
You wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough
to admit if you're wrong.
What's the point?
Hooks and lines?
You lose one, you rig one.
Twelve minutes, south-southeast, now!
Full throttle!
Aye-aye, sir!
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick them to the surface.
And then I jab at them.
I'm not going to haul them up
like a lot of catfish.
Hooper, full throttle!
I don't have to take this abuse
much longer.
Your head's bleeding.
First aid there.
Start that chum line again, will you?
Let Hooper take a turn.
Hooper drives the boat, Chief.
Stop playing with yourself, Hooper.
Slow ahead, if you please.
You heard him. Slow ahead.
Slow ahead.
I can go slow ahead.
Come on down and chum some of this shit.
You're going to need a bigger boat.
Shut off that engine.
That's a 20-footer.
Twenty-five.
Three tons of him.
We're going to need
a bigger boat, right?
Gotta get to work.
How do we handle this?
Come up front, Martin.
I need you.
He's circling the boat.
<i>This is Amity Point Light Station to</i> Orca.
<i>Come in,</i> Orca.
<i>Orca.</i> Come in.
<i>I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.</i>
Put her on.
Come on, Martin! Move!
I'm not going out there!
Beyond the edge of the barrels.
Go to the end of the barrels,
further out.
- Further out!
- Why?
- Go further out!
- What for?
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
What?
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
I need something in the foreground
to give it some scale!
Foreground my ass!
Your husband's okay.
He's fishing.
He just caught some stripers.
We'll bring them for dinner.
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.
I'm not staying here!
I'm begging you!
God damn it!
Come here, darling.
Chief, I want you up on the bridge,
just take her forward, steady.
I've never steered a boat in my life.
Just watch my hand,
take her steady.
Mr. Hooper, attach the end of this line
to the first keg.
I've got to get a good shot
at that porker's head.
He's coming.
Hooper? Get clear of the bow.
Hurry up, will you?
Your turn, Quint.
Hooper, where are you?
Hurry it up now, tie it on.
He's coming straight for us.
Don't screw it up now.
Don't wait for me.
Come on, Hooper, hurry it up!
Tie it on!
Now.
Kill it!
Now!
Shoot!
Time.
What were you doing?
You knew I had
to get a clean shot
right in the head.
All right, let's see how long
that barrel takes to bring him up.
Bring another barrel!
I'm coming around again!
What do we do now?
We're quitting, right?
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.
We could radio in
and get a bigger boat...
Don't you worry about it, Chief.
It won't be permanent.
You want to see something permanent?
You want to feel something permanent?
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?
Knocko Nolans, St. Patty's Day, Boston.
I got that beat.
It's a moray eel.
It bit right through my wet suit.
Well, Hoop, now, listen
I don't know about that,
but I entered an arm-wrestling contest
in a bar in San Francisco.
See this?
I can't extend that.
You know why?
'Cause in the semi-final
celebrating my third wife's demise,
big Chinese fellow,
he pulled me right over.
Look at that.
That's a bull shark.
He scraped me when I was taking samples.
I got something for you.
There's a thresher. You see that?
A thresher's tail.
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.
You want a drink?
Drink to your leg?
I'll drink to your leg.
So we drink to our legs.
I got <i>the crème de la crème.</i>
Right here. Hold on.
Here, you see that?
You're wearing a sweater.
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.
She broke my heart.
What's that one?
What?
That one, there.
On your arm.
A tattoo. I got that removed.
Don't tell me.
"Mother."
What is it?
Mr. Hooper, that's the
<i>U.S.S. Indianapolis.</i>
You were on the <i>Indianapolis?</i>
What happened?
Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes
into her side, Chief.
I was coming back
from the island of Tinian to Leyte
just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.
1,100 men went into the water.
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.
Tiger, 13-footer.
You know how you know that
when you're in the water, Chief?
You tell by looking
from the dorsal to the tail.
Well, we didn't know.
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret
no distress signal had been sent.
They didn't even list us overdue
for a week.
Very first light,
sharks come cruising
so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.
You know, kind of like old squares
in a battle like you see
on a calendar
like the Battle of Waterloo.
The idea was...
the shark comes to the nearest man
and he starts pounding,
hollering and screaming.
Sometimes the shark
would go away...
but sometimes he wouldn't go away.
Sometimes that shark, he looks
right into you, right into your eyes.
You know, a thing about a shark,
he's got...
lifeless eyes.
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be living
until he bites you.
Those black eyes roll over white and then...
Then you hear
that terrible high-pitched screaming.
The ocean turns red.
In spite of the pounding and the hollering,
they all come in.
They rip you to pieces.
You know, by the end of that first dawn...
we lost 100 men.
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.
On Thursday morning,
I bumped into a friend of mine...
Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.
Baseball player, bosun's mate.
I thought he was asleep.
Reached over to wake him up.
He bobbed up and down in the water
just like a kind of top.
Upended.
He'd been bitten in half,
below the waist.
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.
Younger than Mr. Hooper.
He saw us and he came in low,
and three hours later...
a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.
That was the time
I was most frightened.
Waiting for my turn.
I'll never put on
a life jacket again.
So, 1,100 men went into the water
316 men come out.
The sharks took the rest,
June 29, 1945.
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
What's that?
It's a whale.
<i>Farewell and adieu

Start the engines.
Fire her up!
Right in the middle!
He's busting the shaft.
Put out the fire, will you?
- Pump her out.
- Done.
Everybody on deck.
He ate the light.
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.
Quint, come on.
What's wrong with this?
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.
You okay?
Chief, more left rudder!
Pull your left hand down.
I can't. It'll only go
about three inches.
All of our injectors got scored
from the salt water in the fuel.
Yeah, the housing's bent,
you can hear it.
Try the left rudder again.
More left. Good. Once again now.
Quint, there it is.
What do you say, Chief?
The barrel is up,
it's right in the stern.
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.
Quint, if we can get close enough...
I've got things on board
that'll kill it.
Just want to goose him up.
Come on.
When he runs, you drop that rope
or you'll lose your hands.
I've seen fingers
torn out at the knuckles.
Whole sea's bones, full of them.
Give it to me a minute.
Haul in that line
or it'll foul us.
Start the engine.
Where are you going?
I'm going to make a phone call.
Hello, mayday, <i>Orca.</i>
Coast Guard?
Coast Guard, this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you read me?
Coast Guard, this is the <i>Orca.</i>
Do you...
Excuse me, Chief.
That's great!
That's just great!
Now, where the hell are we, eh?
You're certifiable, Quint, you know that?
You're certifiable!
You're certifiable,
but I'll tell you this!
Boys,
I think he's come back
for his noon feeding.
Hook me up another barrel.
Bring her around after him.
Full throttle!
Get me right up alongside of him!
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not going to take it!
Five degrees port.
All right, hold your course.
Five degrees port now.
Hold your course.
Fast fish.
Watch my hand.
Be sure you watch my hand!
Follow me.
Lad, you watch him now! Starboard!
Run him down, Hooper.
Hard aport.
Watch him. Starboard.
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.
It's incredible.
- They're up again!
- Now what?
Why don't we lead the shark into shore
instead of him leading us out to sea?
Grab a couple of poles.
Hang on now, we're going around.
Into starboard. Easy.
I'm going to back her off now.
Watch those barrels, boys.
Watch them.
All right, gentlemen, snag them.
Now then, tie them
to the stern cleats.
Brody, bring your end
around the cleat.
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.
Stay clear of the line!
Watch it. Stand clear.
Stand away from those stern cleats!
Back home we got a taxidermy man.
He's going to have a heart attack
when he sees what I brought him.
Throttle back.
You're losing a cleat.
My God, this one, too.
They're both going.
He's eating his way
through that line.
He's working his way
right up to us.
Quint!
Come on, Quint. Hurry!
Out of my way.
Watch it.
Untie this.
He'll pull out the transom.
Make it fast!
We got another line in him!
I can't, it's trying to run!
We better get another line!
Pull, you son of a bitch!
I hope your back breaks!
Go ahead.
Pull your bloody heart out.
Tie him off!
It's impossible!
Boys, it's too tight!
He's pulling us!
We're breaking up over here!
We're breaking up! Cut it!
Watch your hands!
Cut it quick.
I can't hold it!
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.
Not with three barrels, he can't.
What about us?
Hooper, get the pump out of the locker
in front of you, will you?
We're going to sink, aren't we?
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.
Starting to go under.
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.
You ever have one do this before?
No.
He's chasing us.
I don't believe it.
I'm going to draw him
into the shallows.
Draw him into the shallow water.
I'm going to draw him in
and drown him.
We're heading in, Brody.
Thank Christ!
You ever had a great white do that?
No.
How far do we have to go?
Don't put that much pressure on it.
God damn it.
Shut up. Get back there.
Hold on.
<i>Farewell and adieu
to you fair Spanish ladies</i>
<i>Farewell and adieu,
you ladies of Spain</i>
<i>For we received order
for to sail back to Boston</i>
You idiot, you burned out the bearings.
All right, stop the boat. Stop it.
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?
I think I can pump 20 cc
of strychnine nitrate into him.
If I can get close enough.
Get this little needle
through his skin?
No, I can't do that.
If I can get him
close to the cage,
I can get him in the mouth.
That shark will rip
that cage to pieces.
You got any better suggestions?
Easy.
Up she goes.
Ease her up.
Ain't got no spit.
Try and keep him off me
until I'm lower.
Okay, I'm ready.
Bring him up, God damn it.
Bring him up now!
Pull it up. Pull it.
Pull him up.
Come on, Quint, bring him in.
It's giving way!
Rig something!
Got it?
It's coming.
Slow it down.
Slower.
All right, come on.
Show me the tank.
Blow up!
Smile, you son of a bitch!
Quint?
No.
Can we get in on those?
What day is this?
It's Wednesday.
It's Tuesday, I think.
I think the tide's with us.
Keep kicking.
I used to hate the water.
I can't imagine why.
