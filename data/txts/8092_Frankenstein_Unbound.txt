Some negligible

- Barely measurable.
- Will they fund the next step?
Time out, Doc. I n the three months
since you've been testing this thing...
we've had freakweather,
people disappearing and these time slips.
I'm sorry, but we have
a very public crisis brewing here.
All right, so we have
a side effect to contend with.
It's not the end ofthe world.
The president is getting a sore throat from
denying any knowledge of this program.
Joe, I've gotta
tell him something.
Yes, well, tell him
when we implode an object...
it slips out oftime.
And right now, when it goes,
it sort ofleaves a door open.
What you're trying to say
is that you seriously screwed up.
He wanted a weapon.
He's got a weapon.
We got work to do.
Well?
He didn't go for it.
Joe, it's not over.
<i>- There's still time.
- [Man ] The cloud's building again,Joe.</i>
I wanted to create a weapon
that wouldn't destroy the world.
And look what I did.
<i>[Man ]
Is it reversible?</i>
Oh, my God,
I hope so.
It needs more work.
I'll need the prototype

The overwhelming evidence
presented today...
will prove that J ustine Moritz did
brazenly commit this most vile crime...
<i>this unforgivable act against
the people ofGeneva...</i>
<i>and, myfriends,
against all mankind.</i>
Excuse me, Reverend.
Are the seats next to...
the young lady over there
open to the public?
Obviously, good sir,
you are a stranger here.
Sorry. I don't understand.
<i>[Reverend]
That is Lord Byron's mistress.</i>
<i>The Lord Byron
lives here in Geneva?</i>
Across the lake in sin...
with the poet Shelley
and Mary Godwin.
<i>- [Buchanan ] You mean MaryShelley.
- They are not married.</i>
Perhaps not.
But she's a great writer. Excuse me.
A giant, you say?
Well, the tallest man
I ever seen, sir.
And yet, you saw him
only at night?
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
But his footprints went
all over my field come morning.
<i>- I dug one up to showyou, sir.
- Here'syourbox, sir.</i>
Raise it.
Show the court.
[ Laughter ]
Your Honor, that was the footprint
of the beast what killed my sheep.
<i>I swear it!
I've seen it with my own eyes!</i>
Now, what if it was the same brute
what killed the little boy?
[ Laughter ]
Well, how do you suppose
I lost the sheep? Huh?
How do you suppose I got
this gash on my forehead?
- Spirits.
- [ Laughter]
Next witness.
Your Honor,Justine Moritz
is an innocent child.
<i>- Sir,you've hadyoursay.
- She's innocent as the blessed virgin.</i>
Forgive me, Miss Godwin. The young
girl over there, is she the one on trial?
Yes. She's accused of killing
William Frankenstein, who was six.
She lacks the physical strength necessary
to commit the crime as described...
<i>so, ofcourse,
she's accused ofwitchcraft.</i>
It is a travesty.
Yes, but excellent material
for a book, I suppose.
- What do you mean, sir?
- My name is Joseph Buchanan.
I'm a great admirer
ofyourwork, Miss Godwin.
You must be confusing me
with someone else, Mr. Buchanan.
I've never been published.
Can you identify this?
It's the locket...
that belonged to William.
Can you explain how this charm
came to be amongst your belongings?
When I awoke...
I found it.
The truth is...
you took it after killing
William Frankenstein...
after breaking his neck
and wrenching his arm from his body!
Come, girl! Admit it, and allow yourself
the mercy ofGod's forgiveness.
No! No!
I-I didn't do it!
Excuse me.
<i>Now, as to the charge
ofwitchcraft--</i>
Your Honor, we find
Justine Moritz guilty...
<i>ofthe murder
ofWilliam Frankenstein.</i>
J ustine Moritz,
you have heard the verdict.
You are hereby sentenced
to hang by the neck till dead.
<i>Execution is scheduled
for tomorrow at noon.</i>
Poor kid.
Victor, I beg you
not to go.
Where are you?
<i>I knowyou have returned.
Revealyourself.</i>
- [ Growls ]
- [ Gasps ]
Who are you?
Give me what you promised,
or I will break him, Victor!
I will crush everyone
around you!
Then I will crush you.
[ Whimpering ]
You made me.
Now you would destroy me. Why?
- You murdered my brother.
- Mur-dered?
You stopped his life!
He was easily crushed.
<i>You should have made him
strong, Victor, like me.</i>
I did not make William.
No?
Then... who did?
He was born ofwoman,
you monstrous wretch.
I did not ask
to be made monstrous!
<i>I am alone and miserable.</i>
Make me a mate
as you promised.
Make me a mate,
and you will never see me again.
I will never make
another like you.
Make me a mate...
or I will...
murder Elizabeth.
Victor!
Why are you following me?
Are you from the court?
I told you, I am a doctor.
I know ofyour discovery.
I know that you put life into that
creature, and I know that he is killing.
I wanted to give man
the power to create life...
to free him from
a cruel and fictitious god.
What man ever achieved that?
Scientists...
have made far greater monsters
than yours, Victor.
Tell the truth. Show the world
what you have created.
I mpossible.
I've created an abomination.
What about Justine?
Who will free her from the mob?
You cannot let her
pay foryour sins.
What sins?
I'm a scientist.
I cannot sin. She must die.
The truth is too unbearable.
Ifyou want to ease your conscience
about William, then help the girl.
Ifthey kill her, how will you live
with yourself after that?
I don't know.
Help the girl, Victor.
Continuous flow of ink
contained in barrel. Remarkable.
Did you make it clear
that the girl is innocent?
<i>- And you simply lick this?
- Yes. It tastes like--</i>
Peppermint.
[ Laughing ]
<i>Victor, the girl.</i>
Yes, certainly.
The girl is innocent.
Good. Then I shall take
this letter in the morning...
and deliver it
to the judge in person.
No, not the judge. You must deliver it
to my fiancée, Elizabeth.
<i>She's ofgoodfamily,
and thejudge will listen to her.</i>
You are truly
a marvel, Buchanan.
This electric carriage--
You have mastered

that she is here.
I have an urgent letter
for her. Ah, ah!
Victor asked me to deliver
it to her in person.
Thankyou.
Stay. I will inform
Miss Levenza you are here.
<i>[ Chattering, Indistinct ]</i>
God disapproves of

Won't you come in?
I cannot say that
I am grateful, sir...
but I do thankyou
foryour trouble.
- Allow me to escort you to the judge.
- But what do you mean by that?
Well, they're going to hang
Justine Moritz at noon.
I'm afraid no one
could prove her innocence.
But the letter
explains her innocence.
There is nothing here
about Justine.
Victorwarns me that I must leave
Geneva immediately for my safety.
Where has Victor gone?
You must tell me, orJustine will die.
Werner!
Listen to me.
Victor's brother
is already dead.
Others have been killed,
and more will follow unless we act.
- Victor is responsible, Elizabeth!
- Who are you?
Whywould you turn me
against Victor?
- Werner.
- I want to help him, Eliza--
Elizabeth.
Reference Mary Shelley.
Born:
MaryWollstonecraft Godwin.
Mary Shelley.
Born: 1797. Died: 1851.
Mistress to the poet Lord Byron,
and wife to the poet Percy Shelley.
<i>She is chiefly remembered as the author
of the novel Frankenstein.</i>
- Hard copy novel.
- Printing a hard copy.
The subject matter
is artificial intelligence.
Miss Shelley wrote the book when
she was only 19 years old...
while living with Byron and Shelley
at the Villa Diodati...
presently some 200 yards
north-northeast.
Be forewarned, Dr. Buchanan, probability
is high that they are late sleepers.
<i>[Thunderclap ]</i>

[ Chuckles ] Maybe you could, uh,
point that thing anotherway?
Why so?
Tourist shooting season opened today.
I've bagged three already.
Yes, but I'd hate to be shot
without a proper introduction.
You must be Lord Byron.
I have no intention
of introducing myself...
and I feel quite persecuted when British
trespassers loaf about my property.
No, I'm not a trespasser.
I'm an admirer.
Dr.Joe Buchanan.
You're not British, are you?
Well, I'm sort of, uh,
nouveau American.
- What about those?
- What?
Those contrivances.
Oh.
These are a gift...
to one of the greatest
visionaries of the 19th century.
My God.
These lenses are exceptional.
Are you an inventor?
A scientist.
Really?
I thought all American scientists
were named Benjamin Franklin.
<i>Ah. Let's see what
Mistress Mary's doing.</i>
<i>Damn.
Nothing scandalous.</i>
Writing as usual.
What a waste of female talent.
Perhaps Miss Godwin
has literary talent as well.
- What do you want here, sir?
- I must see Mary. Miss Godwin.
A suitor?
Oh, no.
What will Shelley say?
We breakfast late, Buchanan.
Join us.
Prove yourself
an amusing guest.
We suffer from
too much peace here.
[ Buchanan ]
There is murder at hand in Geneva.
Well, now, what's this?
A bailiff, I hope,
or a poet.
Meet Percy Shelley,
my fellow reprobate in exile.
Ah, he's risen.
Joe Buchanan.
- An American scientist.
- Mmm.
<i>Andare those slippers
American too?</i>
I've quizzed him
already, Percy.
They were made by a Mr. Florsheim
in a redundancy...
called New York, New York.
What brings you all the way
to our little paradise, Doctor?
<i>Just anothermoth
drawn to Mary's glib.</i>
Listen, I'm here because of the imminent
execution ofJ ustine Moritz.
I believe he wants to take Mary
to the hanging.
- How romantic.
- You know how it is, Percy.
- Sex and death.
- [ Chuckles ]
Ah!
There she is.
My love.
Mary,
allow me to introduce...
Dr.Joseph Buchanan.
As it happens,
we've already met.
<i>How doyou do again,
Dr. Buchanan?</i>
<i>[ Thunder Rumbling]</i>
That is the most mysterious
cloud I 've ever seen.
<i>I see a remote
sunlight glean...</i>
as though t'were not
a cloud at all...
but a gateway
to a distant world.
What did you want to see me about,
Dr. Buchanan?
Miss Godwin, I know that you've been
following the trial ofJustine Moritz.
You must help me try
and stop her from hanging.
- Why come to me?
- Because you know that the girl is innocent.
<i>You know the truth.
Well, that's whatyourbook is about.</i>
What do you know
of my book?
I 've only a few chapters
of the story.
Are you from a journal, sir?
Worse. Maybe a publisher.
<i>Yes, I believe
the girl is innocent.</i>
But I don't know anything
that would help her.
Forgive me. I thought
that you knew the truth.
I thought that
you could help me.
[Jeering, Shouting ]
-Back off!.
-Please, sir. I've made my peace with God.
The girl goes free!
[ Protesting, Shouting ]
Somebody help--
[ Laughter]
No!
[ Men Shouting ]
<i>[Yelling]</i>
[ Groaning ]
We're going to make you better.
Shh.
The girl--
They killed the girl.
And theyvery nearly
killed you too.
I watched the whole
terrible incident with these.
Oh.
You were very brave...
and foolish.
- How did you get here?
- I sailed across the lake to rescue you.
- How did you know I was writing a book?
- It's a long story, Mary.
Well, it's usually better
to start at the beginning.
Suppose I show you instead?
Is this your carriage?
Yes. Yes, it is.
It's amazing.
Like to go for a ride?
I'd be delighted.
Good afternoon, Mary.
I am not a carriage, but a car.
Let's fly.
Are we flying?
No. It's just
a great suspension system.
<i>[Horse Whinnies ]</i>
I've never even imagined
anyone like you before.
Well, that's not surprising,
because I don't exist yet.
I'm from the future.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, that's absurd.
I know ofyour book
because I've read it.
But that's impossible.
I've onlyjust started writing.
And you'll finish it
and you'll publish it...
and you'll add a new word
to every language on Earth--
<i>Frankenstein.</i>
- This says Mary Shelley.
- Congratulations.
My book!
My book will be known
in the future.
How does it end?
How do I end? And Shelley--
Do we die young?
Do you reallywant
to know that?
Stop the car.
I'll have my own life.
Well,Joe from the future,
wherever did you come from?
<i>[Buchanan ]
There.</i>
Percy's cloud.
He was right.
It is the gateway
to another world.
I made it,
came through it...
fractured the core
of time and space.
I wanted to do
the world a favor.
<i>But like Victor Frankenstein,
I created a monster.</i>
Then it's true.
Dr. Frankenstein
has created a man.
I 'm afraid it is.
It is an abomination
in the eyes of God.
You don't believe in God?
I don't know.
I see.
Science is your religion.
Well, I never thought
of it like that.
I've tried to imagine
what a man of science must live with.
I think he lives
with madness.
With madness?
<i>The madness
ofpossibility.</i>
I'm sorry if I've said
something to upset you,Joe.
Upset me?
Mary, you amaze me.
You live in the 19th century...
and yet you understand the future
infinitely better than I do.
I wish I did.
[ Laughing ]
Percy and Byron
preach free love.
I practice it.
You and I are under
an enchantment,Joe.
Will you fly to
some other place in time?
I wish it were that easy.
This place, this time--
I don't even understand
why I ended up here.
I'm afraid I have a theory.
Would you like to hear it?
Mm-hmm.
I thinkyou're here
to stop Dr. Frankenstein.
- Werner?
- Mistress?
- Please prepare my carriage.
- Shall I drive you, Miss Levenza?
No, I must go alone...
to see Dr. Frankenstein.
As you wish.
Are you going
to kill it?
No, quite the opposite.
I must make him a mate.
You were a madman.
You heard him.
He threatened to kill Elizabeth.
Buchanan, please.
I have laid
all the groundwork...
but I haven't been able
to store enough electricity.
I know you have abilities
beyond my own in such matters.
I think I should
show you something.

[ Computer]
Good evening, Dr. Buchanan.
My sensors indicate substantial damage
to my electrical system.
<i>So forget that. Haveyou completed
the calculations I asked for?</i>
Yes. All probabilities
indicate that...
it is not possible
to reverse a time slip effect.
Not possible? Why not?
- Time space unbound.
- Come on. Explain yourself.
Time space unbound is the logical outcome
ofyour experiment, Doctor.
You have introduced a new condition
into the physical world.
- What is that?
- It's a machine that thinks...
<i>and talks.</i>
What is the probability of surviving
a laser-generated implosion?
- Did you make it?
- Yes.
The probability is high
that you will be transported...
to a new place and time.
Is it a man?
No, it is not a man.
