Shit, that's fast.
Did you like that?
Pietro, come here.
I'm talking to you.
Come here.
What do you want?
Go buy me cigarettes.
Filterless.
I was playing.
I spit on the ground.
If you're back before it dries,
I'll give you 20 lire.
Hurry, the spit dries quickly.
Run, Pietro.
Run, Pietro.
Run, Pietro. Go.
Go, run.
Peppino, hurry.
Hurry.
If the world wants peace
It must hear the voice
Of a nation that says:
Duce, Duce, Duce.
Peppino Torrenuova.
Why aren't you singing?
Answer me.
Cat got your tongue?
Get your book out.
Where did you put your book?
Speak.
Where's the book?
Answer me, subversive.
I'm talking to you,
what happened to the book?
The crapa ate it.
Speak Italian.
-The crapa ate it. The gowt.
The 'gowt'? Goat.
You make a fool out of me?
Get in the corner.
Quiet, everyone.
Let's begin.
Singular and plural.
The schoolboy...
-The schoolboys.
The pig...
-The pigs.
The horse...
-The horses.
The aunt...
-The aunts.
The brother...
-The brothers.
The cloud...
-The clouds.
The notepad...
-The notepads.
The squirrel...
-The squirrels.
The dream of Sofonisba.
Bring Karthalo to
interpret my dream.
What a pain in the ass.
Vagabonds.
I don't call for the Queen.
But the Queen calls for me.
To Gurzil, the God ofWar...
and our gods...
I consecrate my iron.
What did he say?
-My iron. My sword.
Offered him the sword.
Are you blind too?
Can't I ask a question?
Silence, ignorantfools. Savages.
-Enough already.
Let that illiterate idiot show his face.
It was Cicco Torrenuova.
-Not true.
Come on, Cicco.
Who's this?
-Cicco from Bagheria.
Here you go. Bravo, Cicco.
Brain of mush, teeth of steel.
What do you say?
The other was younger.
Drop the price by 300 lira.
300? And you'll feed my children?
Let them come over.
There's food for all.
To work.
The day's ending.
Move.
Hurry, go ahead.
Come on. To work.
Look at these two bums. To work.
-Looser.
Hold on. You have to pick ten.
Don'tforget.
Nino, what did he say?
-Nothing. Hurry, we are late.
How many olives did you steal?
-What olives?
Greetings, Don Giacinto.
Seven and three... Ten.
Get out of my sight.
Feel up your sister, creep.
Creep to who? Who?
-Enough.
I do not want trouble
at my home. Enough.
I don't want to see you again.
You and all your race.
Eight and two, ten.
Nine and a half.
This one's only halffull, punk.
-Sorry, Don Giacinto.
Whose son are you?
-He's Cicco Torrenuova's.
Sorry. A contract is a contract.
It was supposed to be ten.
Nino.
-Let him go.
He's a baby.
-Piece of shit.
Forjustan hour...
I wantyou.
To tellyou something
you don't know.
This one thinks he's witty.
-He's good.
I would give...
my life foryou.
What are you doing?
-Subversive.
Forjustan hour...
Kick his ass.
Come on. Let me earn my bread.
I didn't write the song. I sing.
Cicco, the books are in
the dressing room. Take them.
Books, eh?
You were the one laughing.
-Me?
Shakespeare and Manzoni.
That's right.
Why did they arrest your cousin?
-Yes, dad. Why?
We'll talk about it at home.
You have to get up early.
-I know.
How long will I have to stay out?
-A month and a half, two months.
What? Are you afraid?
-No.
Be careful, son.
Do everything Uncle Minicu asks.
Okay.
-Understand?
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, Nino.
-Bye, Peppino. Take care.
That's not what we agreed to.
I'll add another cheese roll
and ricotta.
Three cacicavalli and four rolls,
and keep him another month.
Okay, Cicco.
So long as you are happy.
Go earn your bread, Peppino.
-Say bye to all.
May good fortune follow you.
And study every once in a while.
Morning, Don Carlo.
-Good Sunday.
God bless you, Don Carlo.
Whose turn is it?
Let Don Carlo go first.
-You're too kind.
A kilo of beef.
-From the neck or the hip?
The neck, please.
Can I have some leftovers
for my cat?
Mom...
-Yes?
You're mad.
-I don't give a damn.
No one needs to know
we haven't eaten for a week.
And if we starve?
-Never mind.
Better dead than maligned.
Remember that.
How are we today, Tana?
-Can't complain. Thank God.
See those three peaks up there?
Underneath them lies a treasure.
-A treasure?
It's said that if you throw
a stone and hit all three...
below you will open a cave
full of gold.
We've all tried
for hundreds of years.
It's hard.
-That's why no one ever succeeds.
Then it's pure bullshit.
-Who knows?
Until a stone hits all three
we can't say it's not true.
Try again.
Shit, they're eating my books.
How beautiful this sausage.
Beautiful sausage.
So fresh.
What beautiful sausage.
Half a litre, please.
How beautiful this sausage.
Look how beautiful.
It's completely pork meat.
It's just a fat pig.
How beautiful this sausage.
Look at it.
Look at that beauty.
The whole hog.
Look how beautiful.
Get him out of here.
It's completely pork.
Buy it. Whole hog.
Scoundrels.
Where are they taking him?
-Prison.
This sausage is the whole hog.
Peppino, fill this for my wife.
-Will do, sir.
What do you want?
Go waste your time elsewhere.
-Don't be upset.
Perfect.
-Perfect what?
A sandwich with four fritters.
Fritter sandwiches...
How long are you going
to take with that?
If it was me, in four bites
I wouldn't even leave crumbs.
Give me one with eightfritters.
He fell for it.
Come here.
You said four bites?
-Yes, four.
One...
two...
...three and four.
Get the smallest.
Let's see if you are
a man of your word.
Swallow.
You'll choke him.
-Hush you.
Eat. Chew, you bastard.
Now you eat them one by one
or I'll cut off your head.
Go home.
-Shame on you.
You, eat it.
He's just a kid.
-Give him time.
Shame.
-Grab the sandwiches.
Maestro, how much longer?
-Silence, shameless fools.
Some patience, please.
If you move we'll never be done.
I've told you.
If you have to talk, talk.
But stand still.
Why did I do this?
Lord, forgive me.
Renato, are we sure
it'll come out good?
Father, it's useless to peek.
You can only judge it at the end.
Realism, I can understand.
But do the apostles and angels
need the faces of these bums?
Father, we can go home.
Back to your places.
-Mistreated.
Shameless.
-Jesus Christ...
How much longer?
Great, Peppino.
How do you want it?
Like Rudolph Valentino?
-I can't.
Then do whatever you can.
-Bad temper.
What did I do?
Sit still.
Mail for Torrenuova.
For your son, Nino.
-Have a good day.
Pa. Did my draft summons come?
This time things
are looking grim.
Half a litre.
What will Stalin do?
-He'll handle it.
Peppino, get out.
-I won't talk with anyone.
You're too young. Patience.
Alright, goodbye to all.
Look at those three at lgnatius'.
I do not like that at all.
Are you lgnazio, the poet?
-Who are you?
Joachim Corrao from Palermo.
-What do you want?
I was in prison, political.
What do you wantfrom me?
-I've been told you can help.
They told you that, eh?
If you could lend me
a book of Marxsss.
Marxssss?
-Shhht.
Go read a comic book,
you bastard.
Think you can trick me?
Idiotfascists. It wasn't enough
that you shut down my newspaper?
Do you also want to take
the bread from my mouth?
Curse you all.
I will not be drafted.
Nino.
-Peppino.
I'm over here.
-Peppino.
Look after the old people.
-And you, don't get shot.
Bye.
Don Mariano. You fired
me because I was sick.
My daughter Sarina
is young and works as a mule.
Worth four men. Take her.
-Times are tough, Mother Tana.
Work is scarce.
See how many people I have?
By June I must send away half.
Quick, they killed
a man down the road.
I swear.
In the dark?
How did you see it?
I tripped over him.
-Tripped?
And how did you know
it's a man and not a woman?
Come on, answer.
Check out these idiots.
You'd think I killed him.
How long is one sandwich
taking you?
It'd take me four bites, no more.
-Good for you then.
Heads up.
Hurry.
Run, Peppino.
Rosalie, you too.
Don't worry,
we'll go to the shelter.
You're shaking like a leaf.
-I'm not afraid of bombs.
I'm afraid
of my mother's screams.
Calm down.
They'll bomb Palermo, not here.
Peppino. They say
the Americans have landed.
Tear up your black shirt.
I'll give you one of mine.
Come.
Look, a safe.
Break it.
Try this.
Give it to me.
Make way.
A small hand.
No. No good.
This one.
-It's Peppino.
Stick your hand in.
What have you found?
What do you feel?
There's money.
Asshole.
Give me the money.
-Get back here.
Son of a bitch. The money.
I saw itfirst.
Stop. Stop, thief.
We'll split it.
We'll split it.
We've arrived.
Mannina, they're like locusts.
-Dad, we arrived too late.
Jerks.
Did they leave anything?
Let's try somewhere else.
Are we going home
without anything?
Move.
Wait a second...
What'll we do with it?
-Let's see.
Through the kitchen window.
-Good idea.
At least we'll have
a memento of the war's end.
What?
What?
-I think he said salad.
Go fuck yourself.
What are they talking about?
Ah, onions.
Mom, he wants onions.
These?
Son of a bitch.
Why didn't you say that?
Gift.
What is it?
-A parachute.
What are we going
to do with that?
Do not go into the fields.
It's full of American bombs.
Mannina, make it a little larger.
Is there enough material?
Here's a belt.
Pull it straight.
One.
Two.
Three.
Is that belt really a meter?
He's got a belly like a barrel.
I measured it myself.
It's precisely one meter.
You don't trust Don Giacinto?
-I don't want to sell my land.
Come on. I'm offering
a fair price.
Are you screwing that poor man?
-Who asked you to speak?
My beIt's a meter and
I'm thin as an anchovy.
Ah, Torrenuova.
-Yes, Torrenuova.
You steal grass from my land.
-lt'll be yours when you buy it.
Put back every blade of grass.
Otherwise I'll teach you, thief.
Peppino Torrenuova.
Here's your membership.
Thanks very much, Turiddu.
-You're welcome.
And my brother-in-law?
-No, not him.
He reads the Worker's Times.
Sure, but every morning
he eats two raw eggs.
Meanwhile, read this.
The duties of party members...
Every communist party member...
must improve their own capacity
to work, manual and intellectual.
Must always have solidarity
with other party members...
and lead a private life
which is honest and exemplary.
Wet your lips.
What can I wet them with?
-Just lick them.
Stay still.
What's all this smiling?
Smile less.
I'll smile if I want.
To smile? What's so funny?
My business. Take the picture.
-As you wish.
Don't breathe.
Hello, Mannina.
Good morning.
Where you going?
-Embroidery class. Where else?
Good luck, then.
-Thank you.
Jerk.
-You want to wash our feet?
Don't worry.
It's justfresh milk.
Hush you.
To refresh the mouth.
Maruzza, come and dance.
One, two, three, four...
Is this how you'd treat a girl?
So you decided I'm the girl, eh?
-Did I offend the politician?
Never you mind.
I'm the only girl here.
Fags.
Anarchist?
-Republican.
So we can marry then.
Onofrio Pace.
Peppino Torrenuova. Pleasure.
Teresa, when will you marry?
-When I've educated all of you.
Who do you want?
The king...
or a Republic?
What does the king care about?
-His own interests.
And a republic?
-Everyone's interests.
It's rigged, communist bastards.
-It's for poor people...
I buy dollars.
I buy dollars.
Don't touch the King.
I'll kill you.
It's me. Stop, it's me.
Nino...
-I survived the war. Now this?
They're related.
Do me this one favour.
Only one, though.
-Just one.
A dance for the uninvited.
Enjoy.
A small Palermo villa...
So muchjoy...
Miss...
Could I have the
pleasure of a dance?
Yes.
Shit, men and women dancing.
Who is that?
-What do I know?
You didn't stop them.
-Why don't you?
Men and women of Bagheria,
thanks for this leap of liberty.
After the Republic's victory this
dance is the start of Socialism.
Socialism... What does that mean?
-You know how to dance?
No.
-Then you can't understand.
May I introduce myself?
-There's no need.
I know your name.
Can I offer you a sweet?
Or a sweet almond?
-Or a candy carob or something.
Take one as a favour to me.
-Great.
35 Cents.
-Yes, uhm...
We'll settle it later.
-Long live socialism.
Get inside.
Dear Mannina, I hope
this letter finds you well.
I've been travelling many
days for some business.
That's why we haven't
seen each other much.
It's hard work.
Though, luckily, it pays well.
I always think of you.
I can't wait to see you
and be with you again.
Also, I have decided to
talk with your parents.
Butfirst there's something
you must know.
I'm a communist.
And people say
a lot of things about us.
For example: that we eat babies.
Trust that this is not true.
It's gossip. I give you my word
that I've never eaten a baby.
It's right that you should be
informed of this hateful gossip.
I love you, as you know. But
honesty should always come first.
At least between us two.
Hi. Do you have mourning buttons?
-I do.
How many?
-All of them.
But there's more than 200.
Do you have more?
-No.
How much?
-60 Lira.
Condolences.
-Thanks.
I wonder who died.
May Day celebration incites
barbaric massacre at Ginestra
Dear Peppino. I'm well.
I hope you are too.
Even though yesterday I saw
you look a little skinny.
You say you're well off,
but my parents have heard...
that you are penniless
and that your family is disgraced...
because the cows you bought after
the war with thatfound money...
all took ill, and now
you don't have a pot to piss in.
And some even say that even if
Communists don't eat babies...
you're worse than the
disease that struck your cows.
I don't buy it. But my parents,
who can't read or write...
have decided to engage me to
someone who owns a lot of land.
Help me, Peppino.
I don't know what to do.
I buy dollars.
I buy dollars.
Why aren't you wearing my ring?
-It's too tight.
Effectively, too small.
I'll enlarge it.
-Just a little.
So how's it? What's going...
-Well...
Whenever I come, you're working.
-lf you don't like it, stay home.
If you kissed, I'll kill myself.
-Let him try. I'll stab him.
Good. A women's liberation
must come from the woman herself.
So the party says.
Does it also say to take the
woman you love and take her away?
It doesn't say so,
but I think it.
Then let's elope.
When will this ever end?
-It's him.
When you break your horns
somewhere else.
Isn't it better that you speak?
Never mind my girlfriend.
Talk to each other.
Talk to each other.
-Fine. Let's talk.
Let's talk.
-Yes, let's.
Let's talk.
-Talk then.
What do we have to say?
-Fucker.
Dad.
Dad.
It's best if you go home.
Why do you ruin my life?
-We'll talk at home.
It doesn't matter.
Everyone knows.
Look me in the eye.
Do I deserve this end?
He's rich. Understand?
-But he's an idiot.
I'll pick my fiancé.
-You are already betrothed.
How you betrothed me, release me.
Take back the ring.
I got it appraised: It's false.
And the photograph.
So ugly I can't look at it.
Tell him not to come
around anymore.
The boyfriend you want,
will never setfoot in my house.
She's right, ravish her.
Everyone does it.
Where will I take her?
I have not even a Lira.
-Stay at the office for a while.
We'll clean it up.
-With all due respect...
my wife and l, spending our first
night under Stalin's portrait?
If the film is American,
why do they speak ltalian?
Stupid, the audio is ltalian.
-Ah. I hadn't thought of that.
It's true.
I hadn't thought of that.
Who is it?
Peppino. What...?
What if someone comes?
Stay calm.
No one can get in.
I was thinking of you.
Scoundrel, you ruin my daughter.
What do I do now?
Guys, they're kissing again.
Get down.
Get out, home wrecker.
-We will not move from here.
Dear daughter, speak to me.
He's ravished me already.
What kind of ravishing is it
if you don't leave the house?
If my husband finds them
in there, it'll be pandemonium.
I'll do what I can.
Peppino?
-Nino.
Hey, Peppino...
-I heard you, Nino.
Mind your own business.
Peppino, don't respond.
Let them be.
Should I go?
-Do I have to say it in Turkish?
Are you still here?
-Head of a mule.
Mr. Cicco...
-May the Lord reward you.
Peppino, it's me, your father.
Come on. Come with me.
I'll deal with it.
Come.
Go to the farm.
I'll see you at home.
On the streets it's no worse.
What street?
We get all the amenities here.
Come on. Come on.
Let's hurry up.
Forward.
Look Pinnazza, he was arrested
with that other one there.
The rings...
-Yeah right.
You don't have any?
-Sarina...
Ah youth.
Okay then.
His father hanged himself
and gambled the property.
Maria Anna Ascalia.
Do you take this man...
Giuseppe Testasecca...
-Torrenuova.
Terranuova...
-Torrenuova.
Torrenuova...
-Whatever. It's all the same.
My cousin, who has cirrhosis.
He looks younger.
All the days of your lives...
How can we do this?
Like this, let's not even bother.
Are you that communist?
-I didn't want to be here.
Whatever God wants.
Next two.
Father, do us the favour.
So what if he's a communist?
He's already painted
among the saints.
Will you take him?
-Of course.
Take the blood.
One at a time.
Drink it while it's hot.
-Are you sure?
When I was expecting
your mother, I was anaemic too.
Drink. Don't be afraid.
Isn't it good?
I'll talk with your father.
Go to his house for now.
I only regret that...
when you deliver,
I won't be around anymore.
Poor thing, what a tragedy.
What happened?
The eggs were broken, my son.
I'm sorry.
Broken eggs?
How are you?
Okay...
Too many disappointments.
How much to take me
to Point Guglia?
Get in, Peppino.
Let's go.
'l want thy steed,' cried Orlando
and advanced with wrathful cheer.
A solid staff that shepherd had,
wherewith he smote the peer.
Whose violence and ire
all bounds exceed.
A cuff he levels, splits the
solid bone, and lays him dead.
Then leaping on his horse
to make more spoil and wrack.
The palfrey tastes corn nor hay,
so exhausts the famished hack.
But not afoot does Orlando stray,
who will not conveyance lack.
As many steeds he finds, their
masters slain, he presses on.
Bravo, Cicco!
Fresh from Naples.
American clothes as new.
Look at this suit.
-Pity I can't wear it. Too tight.
This prince's suit
would be good for Peppino.
It would. But would he ever
wear an American suit?
And look, it's all oily.
-Give it to me.
This suit costs more
to clean than to buy.
You want the difference?
-No, what's right.
Charge nothing.
-SweetJesus.
Nice if it was ready
when he's back from Rome...
before the Party Congress.
Do not look.
-Why?
You'll have children who are
half-man and half-beast.
Goodness gracious.
-Come.
Michael, Angela, look who's here.
Michael. Come here.
In a socialist government
even a cook can become president.
And me? What could I become?
The way you cook,
they'll arrest you immediately.
Why? Isn't it good?
-Of course it is. I'm joking.
When we come to power,
we'll make you pope.
You needed to go study with
communists to learn this idiocy?
I learned the great works
of the socialist ideology there.
I learned politics,
the art of meetings...
I learned how to be the vanguard
that changes all of ltaly.
To improve our future...
-Find a job, eternal shepherd.
Identification?
-You forgot?
President, she's my wife.
-She has no documents.
Fine. Go on, Mannina.
-Thank you.
Please madam, over here.
The first in the top left.
-What's this, electioneering?
Torrenuova, the fourth time.
-She's my wife.
Even saints don't interfere.
-Pardon.
She's even angry.
-I'm sorry.
Holy mother. Peppino.
-Again?
Torrenuova, you cannot
enter the voting booth.
It's an emergency.
It's her eighth month.
This is a trick.
How cute.
Just like his father.
4.2 kilos exactly.
He didn't even eat 300 grams.
-But he looks fat.
I'll pay you later.
-Don't mention it.
Madam Rosa, can you lend me
150 lira?
I'll repay you.
-My daughter...
Cicco Torrenuova.
Did you find America in my land?
What happened?
-Look.
Oh, St. Joseph.
Excuse me, Don Giacinto.
This farce must end.
You read, you sleep...
I'll behead every one
of these filthy sheep.
I didn't do it on purpose.
-Any excuse to steal.
That's too much.
-Are you going to bite me...
with those four rotten teeth?
I may have few teeth left...
but I have many years on you
and I deserve respect, bastard.
Dad, we're waiting for you.
-Eat, my children.
I have to finish
steaming my cough.
How long do you have to steam it?
Pa, what's up?
No...
-What happened?
It's nothing.
I tripped and fell to the ground.
You drink first.
I buy dollars.
Hello, Don Giacinto.
What is it, Torrenuova?
Boys, run.
Don Giacinto...
-It's okay.
If you touch my father again,
I'll pop your eyes out.
They come to rob me at my home,
and I have to keep my mouth shut?
This is your communism?
-You just call the police.
You don't beat up
an old man. Wretch.
Who's he?
-Peppino the communist.
Like father, like sons.
-Watch it.
Well, at least he knows
how to dress.
Leave him alone.
Don't you bust my balls too.
I buy dollars.
I see a lot of names here...
justfor example,
comrade Torrenuova.
Is he here?
-I'm here, comrade Corteccia.
I see here that you are in charge
of a lot, even in the union.
But I must be honest...
Comrade, you haven't written
even a single book?
You don't even have a degree?
-Blame the goat.
What could you contribute to the
Kremlin? What can you bring back?
After all, this is not
a vacation. Are you prepared?
In what sense?
Do you have a heavy coat?
-No.
Now who'll cut off
the dragon's head?
The provincial spokesman.
I knew I would
take it in the ass.
Comrades, what a surprise.
Liborio.
Excuse me, but...
What a pleasure.
Nice to see you.
-You've grown.
Sit.
What's the word from Palermo?
Not much. We hear
a bit now and then.
To what do I owe the honour?
-Listen, comrade...
We recently heard that
you purchased a tailored coat.
Is itforbidden?
Who told you guys?
-Bolshevik counter-espionage.
I'm paying in instalments.
I'm not rich.
-Can we see this coat?
What colour is it?
Anthracite.
May I ask the reason?
-Party orders.
Beautiful.
His ass is big as a house.
It's a bit long.
I must have it shortened.
Shorten what? The coat is fine.
Today's Sunday,
we cut offMingo's head.
Instead we'll cut off
the king's...
Mom, will it be much longer?
-We're nearly there.
Don't stick your head out.
Mom. Can we talk to him?
-You can only look at him.
But, if you speak to him,
he can hear you.
He'll understand that it's us?
-Off course.
Give me your hand, close
your eyes, and walk with me.
When I say three, open them.
Stop here.
Raise your heads.
One, two...
...and three.
I don't see anything.
-Where's daddy?
Annicchia, what happened
to the saints and the virgin?
The Cardinal made them paint
over it. Too much gossip.
Pity.
Let's go.
So we can't see daddy?
Yes, but we'll have to wait.
-Where is he?
In a big, big country,
where everyone is rich.
Will he bring me back
a toy soldier?
Madonna, I can't look.
Goodness, health and providence.
There.
I'll be by later for my medicine.
-Come after lunch.
Goodness, health
and providence...
Mother Tana.
-No, my child.
My name is Masina.
Is it possible?
I understand. Your mother
passed away some time ago.
Come in. Sit. Eat something.
-Thank you, dear.
Come, my house is yours.
-Thank you.
Mannina, isn't she
the portrait of my mother?
Take a good look.
-It's true.
My fiancé 's fine.
My fiancé 's fine.
Is someone far away?
-Yes.
Michael.
Angela.
Goodness, look.
-Dad.
My fiancé 's fine.
You've been looking
run down since you returned.
Corteccia was right,
It was not a tourist trip.
But not because of the cold.
But, how are things
in the Soviet Union?
Onofrio...
I saw terrifying things.
A downpour is coming.
-Go back.
Long live San Giuseppe.
I buy dollars.
Stop. Until St. Giuseppe is inside
not even God should enter.
What's wrong?
-I had a nightmare about snakes.
Who knows what'll happen now?
-What could happen?
The mafia could come
bother us again.
Or the police could arrest us.
-There they are.
Wow, there's a lot of people.
Let's go guys, wake up.
Hey comrade, good to see you.
Comrades, this land belongs
to the citizens of Corleone.
Three, four, five...
There is little to do. I don't
know what keeps him alive.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Peppino...
Peppino is coming now.
Don't worry.
Peppino's coming.
I would have liked...
to see him sworn into office.
Why shouldn't you? As soon as
he becomes a senator...
we'll take the train
and find him in Rome.
Politics is beautiful.
Politics is beautiful.
What did he say?
-That politics is beautiful.
Look.
-Enough of this farce. Get out.
This is not your land.
Watch out, comrades.
Uncle Cicco, greet
my late husband, Bautista.
And my son Cosimo, who died
in Africa. I always think of him.
And my dear departed mother.
-Tell Diego the kids are well.
Say hello to my son.
-And my sister Soluzza.
Write them all down for me,
otherwise I'll forget.
An infamous attack by the mafia
this morning in Agrope District.
A crowd demonstrated in favour
of the Agrarian Land Reform.
Peppino's here.
-Thank goodness.
Pa...
Peppino...
I was waiting for you.
I'm talking to you.
You are to blame.
You in the crowd,
feigning indifference.
Between puffs from your pipe,
you're nothing but a chimney...
in an old cap dark with ash.
-Here, take the baby.
I'm talking to you.
Let's go home.
You all know that only the poor
get the school lunch program.
What does your father do?
He sells fruit.
-Rich.
Balistreri...
Fisherman.
-Poor.
Sciortino...
-Barber.
Rich.
DiQuarto...
-Butcher.
Labourer.
-Labourer.
Guard.
-Carpenter.
Charcoal maker.
What do I put down, Torrenuova?
-Unemployed.
We demand work.
Torrenuova, Onofrio,
what does the party do?
Calm. We've requested
a meeting with the mayor.
We want to talk with the mayor.
-Mayor, come outside.
Let's set fire to City Hall.
Brothers, this is wrong.
-Let's form a delegation.
The mayor is running away.
Let's kill him.
Mayor, we testify to the
exasperation of the labourers.
Conditions...
-Cousin. How are you?
Shit, they're cousins?
-How are you?
Twice removed.
-They're all in it together.
Be careful.
-Don't worry.
Good day.
-Good day.
Mrs. Sarina, pardon me.
Our radio isn't working.
Come in. Join us.
Mannina, Mrs. Matilda.
-Please, take a seat.
All over demonstrations against
the Tambroni government.
Dramatic riots in Genova,
Milano, Rome and Palermo.
Where many are wounded
and some feared dead.
Internal minister Spadaro
has denied all allegations...
... that he ordered police
to open fire.
The police, run.
Mimo. What did they
do to you, Mimo?
Did you go and get yourself
beat up like a fool?
Hey, it's the police.
Our father took a beating.
There's blood here too?
-Coming through. Ice.
You'll kill him.
Give me that ice.
Don't be in the way.
-What'd I do?
All this fuss, for what?
Everyone get out. I'm not dead.
-Let's go. Patience.
Now will you stop dreaming?
-I'm not.
What's with politics?
Cows make more money.
You don't understand anything.
-Bad temper.
It's a black day for all of us.
Notjust because we've lost
one of our dearestfriends.
But most of all,
in a political sense...
of a loss
that should make us reflect.
Because nowadays
we have to sound the alarm...
for everyone who doesn'tfollow
the party line to the letter.
That's all I have to say,
friends.
What happened?
Comrade Onofrio Pace
left us for the socialists.
No shit.
And the agrarian reforms?
-Bankruptcy.
The owners kept the best land.
And the labourers went into debt
to buy some land, and belly up.
That's Sciara. That's where they
killed comrade Sal Carnivale.
Beyond that mountain they killed
Placido lnsoto, the union leader.
They left the body there,
in a crevice by Point Busada.
At Campo Reale, they killed the
federation secretary, Angelosi.
And that city. That's Sciacca.
There Mafiosi killed Acusi Mirago.
The trade union leader?
-Yes.
And there, Befano Lepuni,
leader of the workers.
So, comrade Torrenuova,
why haven't they killed you?
Grandma gave me money
for the bus and food.
Angela.
Pick up the money.
-No.
Come here.
-No.
That's how you treat dad?
-Do as your dad says.
Dad, I'll pick it up.
-No. Stop.
Pick it up.
-No.
Pick up the money.
-Angela, pick it up.
Pick it up.
-Silence.
Pick up the money.
-No.
For the last time.
The last time.
Pick up the money.
-No.
I knew he would do that.
I lost my earring.
Louis, open the window.
It's smoky in here.
She's very good...
Be on your best behaviour.
I want to make a good impression.
It's tiring I know.
We'll go to the beach tomorrow.
Do you like it?
-Yes.
You, you and you, come with me.
-Excuse me, why not us?
The director. Hurry.
Michael, what are they?
Monsters who look like men,
and men who look like monsters.
Who made them?
-I don't know.
They say he was
a half mad prince.
Why Villa Paligonia?
I was fascinated by
the travellers of the 1780's.
and by the art
of Renato Guttuso.
A great place to capture
a grotesque atmosphere.
And this is only a small part.
-How so?
The villa didn't end here.
This was originally an
access road to that gate there.
Along the avenue hundreds and
hundreds of hideous statues...
now lost to history.
Why are you taking so
long? Run. Run.
If I catch you
I'll feed you to the dogs.
Sharp enough to kill a man.
Buy these excellent knives.
What you looking at?
Shoes withoutfeet.
Good as new.
What's he saying?
-He says to give him the top.
Come on. Give him the top.
Do not be afraid.
He won't harm you.
There.
If you want itfast and light,
bring him a live fly.
I understand.
-A fly?
Excellent.
So it'll be fast
and light like a fly.
Won't the fly die that way?
Close the door
or everything will fly away.
What an inferno.
Children are soaked with sweat.
Let me worry about it.
Mommy, why?
-Now you'll see.
What are we doing?
-Undress.
How nice and cool.
Mom, will father be
in France much longer?
Much longer.
Why?
To send us money every month.
Mom, did no one ever
find my earring?
We looked everywhere.
It was swallowed by the earth.
Hurry. If the cripple sees us
he'll whip us with his belt.
Michael. Let's go.
I told you to stay at home.
Run.
Wow. It's loaded.
The cripple caught my
cousin stealing lemons.
He was stripped,
tied to a tree, and whipped.
Grab a couple of the
lemons from further down.
I've never seen the cripple.
He's big, hairy...
is missing an eye and he limps.
Thief.
-The cripple.
Run.
-lf I catch you...
Come on.
-Bastards.
If you take...
Michael, your brother.
Jesus. What happened?
Health and good fortune.
The lord will repay you.
Mrs. Masina.
-How long has it been?
My son ran away.
I found him after a month.
My fiancé  is fine.
My mom was expecting you.
Come, eat a plate of pasta.
Thank you, kindly.
-My pleasure.
Have you read the letter?
-What letter?
Mail for Torrenuova.
-Up here.
My fiancé 's fine.
Dear Mannina, I'm fine.
I hope you are too.
Likewise Pietro,
Angela and Michael.
He didn't put my name too?
-He always saves you for last.
Here in Paris the life
of a labourer is hard.
It rains a lot.
And it's always cold.
Do you want to read it?
-What did I say?
I think of you often,
especially Wednesdays...
when the local movie house
has movies for us immigrants.
The other night I saw
a movie by Fellini.
He has money for the movies?
-Dear Mannina...
the other day my friend
Gino Artania came to see me.
It was very endearing.
What about us?
-Let it go.
I can't read like this. Can we
not ask for each small nuance?
Take iffrom the top, ma.
It was very endearing.
He encouraged me...
saying I should return
to work for the party.
I'll be nominated for the council
and might work in Sicily.
Papa's coming back.
Before I decide I'd like
to hear your opinion.
I buy dollars.
Peppino.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
I'm getting on the first train
out of here. Goodbye to all.
Bravo.
We can hardly live here anymore.
If I were young, I'd go too.
Have a good trip and good luck.
Uncle Minicu.
Do you recognize me?
Of course. Peppino?
-ln person.
No, don't get up.
-I'm sick, but I still bear it.
Why? What do you have?
-Son, I can't even move.
I broke my foot to avoid the war,
and my arm to get 30% benefits.
If I hadn'tjumped
and broken 3 ribs...
the disability board wouldn't
have given it to me, bastards.
You're looking good.
Uncle Minnicu: 1
-1.
LoCoco: 2
-2.
The Lo Coco won't vote for you.
What do you know?
-I know them.
I grew up with their daughter.
Then cut them.
-Cutting.
The Ciara family: 4
-4.
If they elect you,
will they give you money?
A councilman controls the
decisions of the city government.
Discusses, makes proposals...
He works for the citizens.
So much wasted effort.
-You always say that.
Which countries participated
in the Punic wars?
Uh, Punic. Right.
Let's see. Punic...
He doesn't know.
Distribute these to all.
Good evening.
Listen, Peppino.
I received this letter.
What does it say?
What does it say?
Problems?
Unfortunately, you've been denied
a governmentfamily allowance.
And you do nothing?
-Gaspar, we'll try to reappeal.
Another appeal?
Appeal, appeal, appeal.
You don't give a shit.
-Come on, now.
You, the union, the party,
Rome, Moscow and God.
Son of a bitch.
What? Did it kill you? It's over.
This medicine is like oil.
Once it's oil, then vinegar.
But it always makes me cringe.
Do notforget to vote for my son.
Hammer and sickle, number 39.
Please, 3 and 9.
My husband is a separatist.
-Still?
Garibaldi unites and he divides.
Let's decide.
Grandma, first you did it
for my father and now?
I don't do itfor him,
nor for the party.
Why then?
To stick it to the mafia,
for what they did to my father.
What did they do to him?
Back in the day my father
was rich, and had a nice car.
One morning he
accompanied his nephew...
who owned a piece of land
that was drying up.
By accident, he saw this boy
argue with some shady characters.
They wouldn't give him
water for irrigation.
Whatever happened, this nephew
was never heard of again.
My father wouldn't rest and
was always asking questions.
One Sunday some friends invited
him to the country for a party.
They had him eat and drink.
And then...
Three months later I was
the one to identify my father.
By his boots I recognized him.
Every morning I was
the one who shined his boots.
And what about his killers?
-The country is full of bastards.
You understand now?
-Yes.
You like the Communists 'cause
they are against the Mafia.
For over 20 years the Christian
Democrats have governed us.
They've impeded the adoption
of a regulatory plan...
and retarded the development
of social and urban planning.
They've favoured every
type of speculation...
and the destruction of
our valuable artistic heritage.
Even if partly destroyed.
-Oh...
The Communist opposition...
Silence.
Councillor, my building permit?
-Just start building.
Will you waitfor the power,
or cede the floor?
Yes, let's waitfor him
to learn how to read.
Enough now. Let him speak.
The Communist opposition rejects
this shameful state of affairs.
What did you get?
Did you find any snails?
-Look.
Wow. And they all
have their horns out.
Do they tickle?
-A little.
Ms. Sarina, run.
He died. The cripple.
Shit, there is a God.
Let's go guys.
Sit. Sit down.
Yes, with the belt
before he stiffens.
Come on. Push.
Soon he'll be cold. He'll be
stuck all crooked. Poor thing.
A bon locova.
What does 'A bon locova' mean?
-It's a well wishing.
It means:
'May you go to a good place'.
And when said to a dead person?
-Then it's like saying...
'Go with God. Go to heaven.'
Who did you hear thatfrom?
-Grandmother.
Can bad people go to heaven?
-ln theory, no.
But there are men
who seem bad, but are good.
And others seem good,
but are bad.
How do you know the difference?
-That's difficult.
Does the kid need a ticket?
-No, he's too small.
Then I'll have one.
-Yes.
So before you say
that someone is bad or good...
think about it well.
Understand?
It's dark, let's go.
But your daddy is here.
Come on. The cinema is great.
I'll add Palermo, the lnter
and the History's greats.
And the cheese?
-Fine.
I didn't like them anyways.
-That's not the whole set.
Clash of the Titans.
The ltalian Brigade.
The Chains.
Salvatore Agiuliano.
The Gospel according to Matthew.
The Good the Bad and the Ugly.
Misunderstood.
Who's afraid ofVirginia Woolf?
Young men...
-Look, they're making out.
If you remain quiet,
I'll leave you to watch.
Get in, dad.
-Later.
Mr. Torrenuova. Am I disturbing?
-Of course not, Councilman.
I was wondering if you ever
had a day free of protesting.
Not a day you don't demonstrate
against some Councilman.
Democracy is a beautiful thing.
-Beautiful, beautiful...
You ruin a country, and we have
a duty to denounce it out loud.
But not by screwing me.
-I haven't attacked you.
That's what I'm saying. You take
it up with everyone except me.
Did I offend you?
What have I done wrong?
I think I don't understand.
-You understand perfectly.
In truth, I am reduced so that
in my party I countfor nothing.
I'm a two of cups
when the trump is clubs.
That isn'tfunny at all.
The strongest succeed. Those
whose name is on everyone's lips.
In the points of order, leaflets,
reviews and anonymous letters.
We do not write those. What we
say, we say to people's faces.
Just have a demonstration
against me.
We can work out whatever deal.
I can leave you sitting pretty.
We'll forget that old favour you
owe me. Water under the bridge.
Of course, it'll stay between us.
It's just me, and you.
Councilman Bartalote,
There's a lot of us.
'No' to the war.
Free Vietnam.
Turn.
-lt looks good on her, eh?
Walk a little.
Turn around again and walk.
Lengthen it six fingers.
-Everyone has 'em above the knee.
Add eight.
-I'll look old and backward.
Maybe half?
-Are you the queen of miniskirts?
You always preach
emancipation of women.
Is that measured in centimetres?
In drafty skirts?
Fascist.
-We still pay for those earrings.
As you say, four fingers.
I'll shorten the sleeves.
-No, listen...
Then try another jacket.
I'm not sure
about the colour anymore.
How now. What are you saying?
Think about it.
I'll bring you the other one.
You see how nice, Mr. Pace?
-Well, yes...
Itfits you like a glove.
We don't greet each other?
-I'm the sinner. Pray for me.
You cheeky bastard. You know
you're like a brother to me.
And for me too.
But don'tforget, I'm a traitor.
You're too far leftfor us,
and too far rightfor your party.
What a mess, huh?
The socialist traitors
stop any kind of development.
Their leaders are opportunists,
like that reformistTorrenuova.
They stop the battle
against the mafia.
Their propaganda is no longer
backed by the labourers.
Let's see who eats more.
Go...
I've looked for you for hours.
-Where were you?
Here, before it cools.
You like it?
-So so.
Are you never satisfied?
Baaria...
Dad, what does 'reformist' mean?
A reformist is someone
who knows...
if you bang your head against
a wall, it's the head that hurts.
A reformist wants to change
the world through common sense...
without cutting off any heads.
Who did you hear say that?
-Nobody. Who would l?
Good day.
-What can I do for you?
Something that'll kill me.
What happened?
-Nothing. I just want to die.
Do you want to die quickly?
-I want time to get back home.
Of course. That takes time.
Right, then... Let's see.
Here it is.
That's right.
There we are.
Take one big gulp.
May the Lord repay you.
-ln truth, it's 1 20 lire.
See you in hell.
-Good trip.
Where is he?
-ln there.
Nino, do you hear me?
Peppino, I hear you.
But how is it that I hear you?
What time is it?
About 5:30.
-5:30...
How come I'm still here?
-You must be patient.
The drug must take its course.
-It's course... Right.
Do you think I'll die today?
-Sure. How long can it take?
Thank goodness.
It's a shame.
Such a shame.
With elections,
I could have used your help.
We never win anyway.
-Who knows.
Myself? Yes or no,
I accepted it.
What?
-The nomination.
To Parliament in Rome?
-Yes.
What a disgrace.
Did the pharmacist screw with me?
-We can only hope.
I would hate to lose a vote.
Was your nomination unanimous?
-Not completely.
However, the majority wins.
Should I get up?
-lf you're feeling up to it.
Tonight... at 6:30...
In Holy Mother's square...
the Communist Party'll gather.
Congratulations.
Meet our candidate.
-Pleased to meet you.
Damn Communists.
The square is not very full.
And no young people.
The commissioner said 6:30 sharp.
Comrades, come closer
to the stage.
Let's begin.
Uncle Luigi, good evening.
-Nino.
Everybody writes.
Three pens, 100 lire.
Brothers,
and citizens of Bagheria...
What broke? Eggs?
-No, why?
Speak.
-I just thought...
I just made these two eggs.
I hope you like them.
My fiancé 's fine.
Mom, how many eggs are left?
I had only these two.
Should I buy more?
-No.
Don'tforget to vote.
Vote for us, Attanasio.
-Rest assured.
Whatjerks.
I said they'd vote for us.
Attanasio. Good day.
He bends like a tree.
Please...
-Consider it done.
They go with the wind.
Attanasio, no problems?
-You can count on my word.
Attanasio, have you forsaken me?
-I'll tell you.
My mom-in-law:
Christian Democrat.
My wife: Socialist.
My sister-in-law: Liberal.
My son: Republican.
Me: Hammer and sickle.
And so we please everyone.
Good day.
Who knows who they
really vote for?
You're making me see stars.
-Who am l, St. Joseph?
Here you go.
You're going to reject her?
-Funny.
Booth number two.
We respect the electorate.
President, we are in God's hands.
Let's go.
Blinds, lames and a paralytic.
Does he have a factory?
Take me to my husband's grave?
-Vote first, Aunt Ciccina.
But we must stop at the florist.
-Wherever you want.
So who are you voting for?
-For our Lord.
That's not the Lord.
I'm blind. Not stupid, rascal.
Communist Party: 81.
That gives us 30 more votes.
-We're winning.
Easy, easy. Compared to the
last election we lost a point.
What does the federation
secretary say?
And from Rome?
It's early yet.
Whatever.
We'll chat later.
Good luck to me.
Everyone writes.
Three pens 1 00 lire.
We still don't know
how it'll go.
However, for what it's worth:
I congratulate you.
Thanks, councilman.
Best wishes, Peppino.
-Thank you.
Listen, read me this letter.
From lNPS.
-Even I understood that.
They say they recognize
your family allowance.
Congratulations.
Good evening to all.
Everyone, I'll read
the end results.
Grandpa Cicco said that
good news should be celebrated.
What is this good news?
-Are we rich?
I wish.
-Aren't we rich?
Not yet, but...
Come one. Let's see if you guess.
Even if he wasn't elected,
dad took a lot of votes.
These young people.
They don't understand anything.
Mom and Dad are expecting
another little brother.
Or a little sister.
Let's toast.
-To the child.
To Bagheria.
We drink to the health
of Renato Guttuso.
Breath in.
Breath in.
Now with open mouth.
Please finish undressing.
Would you prefer your son left?
-No, he can stay. Sit down.
Did it make an impression on you?
-No.
Do not worry, I'm healthy.
You know who that is?
-Who?
The city planning councilman.
-Him?
How can he see blueprints
and zoning plans?
If there's a new plan, they make
a special print-outfor him.
Did you bring the dough?
Beautiful.
Why does everyone think
we have bad character?
Maybe because it's true.
Or?
Or because we believe we
can hug the whole world...
but our arms are too short.
Okay. Go earn your bread.
You weren't very convincing.
-All the better.
Good morning, scoundrel.
Even a bomb wouldn't wake you up.
Get out of the way.
How long have l
dreamed of this?
Down, thief.
-It's my daughter's.
Yeah right. It's your wife's.
-Thief.
If I catch you
I'll break your bones.
Here's the cigarettes.
-You took all this time?
I went and came straight back.
Not even half a minute.
That spit's dry
a whole lifetime.
Did you buy them on the moon?
You've smoked away 20 lire.
Your faultfor taking it easy.
Come here. I'll give you
the 20 lire all the same.
I do not want it anymore.
Gamble it away.
Mine's the lightest.
Split in half.
It cracked open like a nut.
