Gentlemen, I summarize your
meeting with people in Halswell.
Senator, we have to act fast.
Senator wants to rearm Halswell
these regions of the Middle East.
We learned these past 50 years
any weapon that will eventually sell
up being used against us.
Fuck Halswell, we support
and vice president stirs.
That's what worries me.
Son, my glass.
You can think
what you want from him,
but it has lots of friends
in this city.
Mostly Democrats.
Senator?
A hot flash.
Are you?
Senator!
An attack!
Call for help!
Let me pass,
I am a physician.
It's crazy.
Exactly what we need.
And the bush, Red-Al.
The bush.
<i> It'll be the dog days. </ i>
<i> Another beautiful day </ i>

<i> It's hot! </ i>
We have just learned <i> </ i>

<i> because of a bomb threat. </ i>
<i> rescue vehicles </ i>

Is what I am ... die?
Yes.
Today?
Your husband is original.
You believe that?
I have a little adventure,
and I did that.
How it presents itself?
Your husband knows about it.
This bomb is cute.
What color do you prefer?
Red or green?
What?
Red or green?
Green.
No, wait! Red!
Too late.
Green.
Shit!
Your chewing gum, fast!
Good advice ...
cease to deceive your husband.
And put a panty.
It's yours.
Heck,
thou always queues tokens.
You thought that, the FBI,
I would change?
I had hoped.
What is it?
Have you ever seen this?
A lucky charm?
No, I paste photos
on my chest.
- Danny O'Neill?
- Yes, why?
What is a lottery ticket?
A ban
to approach your wife.
Good day.
Catch this bastard!
What does that mean?
This perimeter is secure!
Nobody is allowed
to enter! Do not be evil.
Turn me this son of a bitch.
Sorry, there has been an explosion
of Delaware.
They send you a helicopter.
Damn, I love Mondays ...
Shards of pottery?
Bone.
Enjoy yourself, Danny.
Fidelity insurance
have struck again.
Danny O'Neill!
You will cough up big this time around.
Do not talk about it.
4 dead and 15 wounded.
This may be due to gas.
If it's gas,
there is one who farted loudly.
It's true that you wanted
defenestrate Traveres?
I could not lift his fat ass.
I'm sorry
for you and your wife.
Everyone is aware.
This happened on CNN?
I know all of this city.
Really? What do you know
Senator Wilkins on?
Pink panties in his office.
Salvation.
You're serious.
Shane!
Remember this tin
in heat.
What do you want,
Madonna you do crack.
Emerges.
I have done nothing, I swear.
I do not know what she has.
You have to mistreat.
Take yourself a can
lubricant and goes to town.
- James is looking for you.
- Where is he?
- Behind you.
- James, James ...
Terrorist attack, eh?
- Where is the gear?
- Not found.
Pardon?
Senator Victor had a stroke
and exploded.
Exploded?
It burned spontaneously?
To you to see.
What did you find?
Nothing, not metal or plastic,
no chemical residue.
You are bruising or what?
Search,
it does not explode like that.
Otherwise,
I know for a long time.
What is this?
Shane, come see.
His fingers were torn.
Or should he turns her manicure.
Terry, I'm on your side.
I just want you to be happy.
Dan, you were
so unhappy lately.
I'm not saying this to me.
I know.
Senator Traveres
Good for you.
You seem happier with him.
Mom, Frank and I are friends.
Hello, darling, I'm back!
I call the police if you want.
Mom, what a pleasure to see you.
Listen, you're still my wife
and this is my house.
A judgment?
And this is my garbage.
I've been through it many times.
I'm sick
to be one that toasts.
This is not me
who will look elsewhere.
Frank Traveres
is not the problem.
People of Washington
think otherwise.
Mom, can you leave us?
Thank you, Mom.
I work with Frank.
People have to be friends.
I can not live with you.
More from ...
Go ahead, say it, God!
It was an accident.
<i> Mandy </ i>
<i> Dad, you answer me? </ i>
<i> One minute, my little treasure. </ i>
<i> You play with me? </ i>
<i> Go to your room, okay? </ i>
<i> I'll be right. </ i>
<i> My God, no! </ i>
<i> Breathe, I beg you! </ i>
<i> Help! </ i>
- Temperature?
- 24 degrees.
That's perfect.
Dr. Bernard.
Mikhail.
- And that new job?
- Okay.
I learned the news.
You have proof that it works.
When I get paid?
I gave you the formula.
- Pay what?
- How are you?
Just kidding.
Be patient, Dr. Bernard.
Yet you were looking forward
having the formula.
You are absolutely right.
I give you a check.
You have a pen?
Yes, of course.
I'll take off.
Sure!
This moron was right,
this is absolutely undetectable.
With this powerful formula,
nothing will stop us.
Nothing.
Sometimes I wonder
what good is all this?
Really?
We will hold a conference
release tomorrow morning.
I want her to be well prepared,
with an emotional impact.
Senator Victor was a friend.
I can not believe it.
Remember:
emotion, feelings ...
Now you know
I kid you not.
The senator's wife,
please let me.
You are inflated to call me here.
And you have me blown
$ 10 million.
<i> I do not know what you mean. </ i>
I'll refresh your memory.
Arms sales.
I do not have your money.
This is what Victor said.
You saw the result.
Victor you were ousted,
you are avenged.
<i> You do not buy a villa </ i>
<i> with vengeance. </ i>
I do not have your money.
<i> that prevents me from revealing all, </ i>
or make you the second victim,
it is good manners.
Fuck you!
You will never reach me.
<i> Never believe what you say it. </ i>
<i> You will be hanged for the murder. </ i>
You have been warned.
Regardless of
protection measures,
or precautions
you will take,
you're dead.
I will overtake you <i> </ i>
<i> where and when I decide. </ i>
And I will take pleasure.
Think that R2D2?
Stoneware pottery.
Plates.
Great.
How did they manage?
In ten years of business,
I always found.
But then, nothing. No idea.
Victor had a stroke
and fell.
Then something exploded,
under or around it.
It makes no sense.
If he had a pacemaker
plastic.
New?
Madonna and I
have analyzed these questions,
and there is not
the slightest trace of explosives.
Or fragments
detonator, nothing.
Progress is being made.
Danny, I want
talk to you one minute apart.
You no longer have to deal
explosives to the police.
I keep hand.
Some people play golf,
others play tennis,
me is the explosives.
It is not the dirty work,
we leave that to the police.
I do not like
arrive after the fight.
Stop, you've had enough drooled.
The FBI is a promotion,
what you think.
No longer take unnecessary risks.
I know what I do.
I know.
I'm worried about you, Dan.
First Mandy, then Terry ...
Too bad so few people
are aware of my privacy.
I speak to you man to man,
from the heart.
I'm fine.
At any point of view.
I become not crazy.
Let them do their job.
One moment, sir.
Please sign it.
Security has been strengthened.
Yes, since the death of Senator.
I have an appointment in his office.
4th floor, on your right.
407.
Senator Traveres
fuck his wife.
No kidding?
Madam, please!
He has not fucked,
he kissed her, period.
In the future,
before gossiping about my wife,
check the info with me.
Yes, sir.
Especially ... think.
Good job, Stu.
He is not dead for 24 hours
another moves.
False, he died
for over 24 h.
A vulture is more appropriate.
Hello, James.
Terry.
Factories that thou here?
We have stuff to do.
Listen ...
I'm sorry.
For the other day.
I do not think.
I'm sorry.
You look beautiful.
Will you have lunch together,
just now?
I have an appointment.
I also have an appointment.
I gotta go.
Sorry I'm late.
Madonna has found something?
No, she is charging.
The collection of Senator continues.
You've never seen that.
It picks
small pieces like that.
I mean ... what you see.
Gentlemen, we are ready.
Traveres!
Mr. O'Neill.
Did you know?
If I told you,
you would not come.
I would have come with a blowtorch.
Hello, Senator.
Senator oversees the survey.
Exact. Needless to say
that the case concerned.
There are many rumors.
Yes ... many rumors.
Have you read the report?
I have read,
but I did not understand.
What does it mean
"No traces of detonator"?
Let me answer that.
That means it's dropped.
You
a personal problem with me.
My wife and you?
It did nothing personal.
The whole city is aware,
it's public.
I need answers to Congress.
In the meantime,
I will follow carefully
progress of the investigation.
Follow me eye
when I get out of here.
O'Neill ...
Learn to separate
work and personal problems.
Touch again to my wife,
and I will divide them
of your life, right?
Jimmy,
if this is our best experts
explosives,
the FBI is wrong start.
Dan is the best,
and Shane, a famous analyst.
I am not married,
I have nothing to fear.
I return to the site.
I will stay until we find.
You will soon have results.
A minute.
Okay, it's O.K.
Everything is in order?
You need this holiday.
Correct, it will do me good.
- Who is driving?
- Salvatore.
Salvatore?
Who's God?
Our driver for 3 weeks.
It is O.K.
It unlocks.
Good afternoon, Senator.
Whether classified
before I left.
I want to confirm
booking of Senator Thyme.
Great, thank you.
Everything is organized.
Eddie,
After the funeral,
organizes me a quick interview
with Traveres.
The plane leaves at 16 h.
Work it out yourself.
<i> Air </ i>
Why it's so hot?
The air conditioning seems broken.
I'm on it tomorrow.
Damn thing!
What is he, the fridge?
I know not.
I must make a revision,
but they are overwhelmed.
What, nothing works?
Water?
No, no water.
Activate the window opening.
Not a word of Traveres trip.
Mean to Susan ...
Eddie, what have you?
My eyes!
Call for help.
Call an ambulance!
Eddie!
Get me out!
What are you doing?
The senator is an attack!
Hurry!
Break the glass! Hurry!
<i> Mobile 6, the central here. </ i>
<i> Do you copy? Answer. </ I>
<i> What's going on? </ i>
<i> Mobile 6 </ i>
He works for you
and he was caught!
You know my men.
He will not speak, he is loyal.
Very touching!
Really!
I know Savio.
I assure you ...
Enough!
Kill him!
Let me guess ...
You did not find any device.
It cares tokens.
We'll indict the alleged killer
Your friend, what do you feel?
I am relieved.
Justice will be served.
You open always
Children's Centre?
Absolutely.
It is close to my heart.
There are hundreds of children,
we raised the funds ...
I will not disappoint them.
You're not afraid?
No time.
More questions.
O'Neill.
- What do you have for me?
- What slab.
Let me go, terrorists
we may believe friends.
The driver was silent.
Yes, it is not the method
and who is behind it.
You are fond of conspiracies
but was able to act alone.
I doubt it.
Especially if he refuses to speak.
Because he is afraid.
What do you think?
I have to go pee.
You just help me?
All right.
Excuse me.
Good morning.
Traveres is there with two agents.
Hello, Senator.
Get up.
The court hearing of Columbia
is open.
The Honorable Vera Blair presides.
Sit in silence.
Good morning.
In any event,
I will lift up the session.
That said,
we will treat the case 7487-4,
State of Columbia
Cappelli against Savio.
The accused has a lawyer
appointed.
Master Lewis
plead you guilty ...
Remove the Senator from here!
Get me out of this chair!
Get me out of this chair!
Pull away!
Agent, release!
Do not approach it!
It will explode!
I never saw that.
There was no machine.
It was the craft.
She drank a little water,
started talking ...
and has been convulsing.
That's it?
No ...
she swallowed a grenade.
Shane, she drank water,
began to sweat,
to tremble, and boom.
A judge disappeared.
There was nothing.
Nothing, but ...
What?
Do you think we can
incriminate the water?
It was not perhaps not.
Are you?
Mike,
'm out guys,
we take the explosive.
Do not insist.
It's not water.

Who is it?
It's me.
Do you realize
that you violate your ban?
I was worried.
Are you?
I wanted to make sure.
Want to enter?
I not denounce you.
Senators
have taken bodyguards.
The National Guard is on alert.
Opinion polls
are in favor of terrorism.
I assure you, it's true.
It is in <i> USA Today </ i>.
You want a drink?
At yours.
Nice place, huh?
There is a chair
somewhere down there.
No, it will go.
Sorry for the confusion.
The good is on sabbatical.
I should call you.
My God ...
It looked like you!
It's good to see you.
Terry, you are my wife.
I need you.
I need to hold you,
I miss you.
Why did you come?
What?
You do not fuck
with senators?
I know how you feel.
We must live
with the same pain.
Look at you.
Terry ...
I'm not as strong as you.
You can sit there,
get drunk
and you feel sorry for yourself.
You are the only
to reproach yourself with.
Goodbye.
Game!
However in a week?
Well done, Frank.
How did you get?
On foot.
What about my 10 million?
I do not know what you mean.
This game will last long?
Victor, Thyme
and now you.
Death march by three, they say.
Frank, do you know
The road to hell?
Do not you dare
to reveal everything.
You would be hard
to explain the 50 million
to support affected
Bill anti-gun.
You do not échangeriez
your job for 40 years in prison.
I do not know what you mean.
This is an important bill.
I am in no way involved in all this.
Someone has my money, Frank.
You've got to find it.
Otherwise, I will explode.
Literally.
Messages for me?
Excuse me.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good news?
I'll test results
late in the day.
If it is an ersatz of water,
they can put it anywhere.
What have you got your ...
Unplug your robot.
I feel <i> Lost in Space </ i>.
What gave the briefing?
Very interesting.
Thyme, like Victor, have supported
Bill anti-gun
for the Middle East.
What?
They would scare the Senate?
As possible.
But there are more interesting.
There remains a third senator
to have supported this project.
Which one?
Shit!
Why they did not
killed first?
Dammit!
Dan!
Do not bullshit!
The lack of answers
exasperates them!
I have one. Tell Traveres
to stay away from my wife.
What are you doing Saturday?
You will come?
You said you would come.
I do not know if I should.
What do you think?
I do not know.
Security is top.
Okay.
It's not going at all.
You are a target.
Stay away from my wife.
Listen, asshole.
Listen to me! If I was sensible,
I would have already gun!
Back with me.
Do not worry about my safety!
I beg you, come back with me.
Shit. Terry!
Stop, you're quite wrong like that.
Gentlemen,
Mr. O'Neill escort to the exit.
Had I been less occupied,
I would have had it earlier.
- You're the best.
- I know.
Traveres is the Boy Scout base.
He pays his taxes,
He has debts
but it did nothing wrong.
There is nothing there?
I have found nothing.
Shit!
With all these corrupt politicians!
Read the list of his possessions,
if you want.
It says
than $ 122 000 per year?
This is his salary,
addition to sides.
He always pays his campaign.
And money for his house?
Purchased in poor condition.
He made a good deal.
But the decor?
It is insane.
He made repairs.
I speak of marble columns,
precious wood.
He still repaying.
Mariam,
a guy who earns the money there,
does not live on such a footing.
It would be foolish enough
to display his money?
He is from Miami.
You're right.
I gotta go.
A great date?
I do not know, but I decided
not wait for you.
You'm back to my place.
You're the best.
I know.
Mariam, thank you.
Good luck, Sherlock.
What?
Shane.
Where are you in the lab?
Heard.
Calm down, I'm coming.
Warn the security
I'm sick of them not to.
Look at that.
Come on, it takes only 30 seconds.
Shit!
What is it?
A strange hybrid mix
liquid explosives.
Shareholders under
a process never seen.
Activated, it is like
a mixture of nitro, napalm,
and hydrogen.
It's complicated.
Wait a minute.
How is it activated?
When you wood, it is active.
Once in the stomach,
it becomes explosive.
I finally understood,
it is because of the acid.
Stomach acid?
That's what I thought,
but I have not.
What did you put in there?
Orange juice!
It's crazy, right?
Boric acid also works.
It defuses with Rennie?
You're not far.
With antacids
kind Alka-Seltzer.
All that is alkaline
neutralize the acid.
Nobody is safe.
Traveres ... he inaugurated
Centre for the kids.
I saw Terry get into his limo.
Welcome
at the opening of Day Camp.
This is an organization
non-profit,
founded to help
children
deprived neighborhoods.
We are proud
to open the first center,
and very happy to welcome you.
Our foundation
was established in 1983,
to help disadvantaged children
across the country.
We are funded
by donations ...
You enjoying yourself?
Yes, but does not present us
as a couple.
I dream.
- Listen, Frank ...
- What has he?
One must speak.
Talking, I love it.
It's my job.
Senator, we are ready.
Okay, I'm back.
Here is the man who
made it all possible:
Senator Frank Traveres.
Thank you, Molly,
for this wonderful presentation.
And thank you all for being there.
Notify your supervisor,
it was a bomb threat.
I'll meet you on the platform.
Not touch
distributors of water.
And the loop-
does not let anyone drink this water.
There is a bomb!
A problem, you must evacuate.
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not panic.
It was a small security problem.
It's safe.
Stay calm.
Evacuate in order.
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not panic!
I repeat: do not panic.
Stay calm,
we control the situation.
Terry!
Do not drink the water!
Do not drink!
- Have you been drinking?
- No, why?
It is explosive.
It was discovered that this morning.
- It will not?
- Danny, no!
This is not what we want.
Madonna has been analyzed,
this is water.
You created
all this turmoil
then there is nothing?
- Mikhail!
- Too late.
We can not wait.
He will understand.
I'll kill them all.
Get out!
Hey you!
Let me go!
Motherfucker, you'll see!
- Stand back!
- You'll see!
You died.
Shane!
It is in the fountain!
Including, Dan, I'm coming!
You got 10 seconds!
10 seconds!
Good God, get out of here!
Move!
Everyone go away!
Allow me a question
before I'll cut your balls.
Why did this happen?
It's not my fault.
I did not say it was!
It is interesting
you mention that.
I did what I had to do.
I've had the VIP pass,
and the job for Red-Al.
I can not help it
if O'Neill showed up.
You should have less worry
for your own life.
I do not care for your life.
Listen ...
I'm here
because of what thou hast proposed.
Not to die.
This is not a good day.
I meant to Frank
I never see him again.
Why?
Because I'm your wife.
What do you think?
Jerry, look out,
I arrive in 10 minutes.
Call us when needed.
Guess.
Security is prevented
and I have a man with me.
Your sexual preferences
interest to me.
You almost killed
hundreds of innocent people.
It would have been your fault.
<i> I waited long enough. </ i>
I have one life to live.
If you kill me,
you have nothing.
That is incorrect, I'll have you killed.
And lost 10 million.
Sorry, Senator
you can not talk.
He has a gun
pointed at his head.
Know who you are,
Senator represents nothing.
Not surprising. I saw
what happened to Day Camp.
Danny O'Neill ...
Senator
fuck your wife, right?
<i> In fact, it should not </ i>
<i> arrive soon. </ i>
<i> She did not </ i>
<i> calls Frank. </ i>
I've fixed it instantly.
How ironic, no?
I did it because I like it.
I'm like that.
Now.
Other weapons in the house?
- I do not believe.
- Yes or no?
Hello Terry? Gwen?
Give me <i> Terry </ i>
Go, go play.
Gwen <i> pass me Terry, good God! </ i>
Who was that?
Someone to a survey.
They are fast.
Your line is cut.
Do you know where is Terry?
You have guards?
Standing.
Go standing.
Who says that things
will be different?
Mom, there was not just him!
You blame the now.
Do not let him do that to you.
You never forsaken never, eh?
Good evening.
What are you doing here?
Mr. Traveres sent me,
You absolutely must see.
No, tell him ...
If he wants to see you,
you should go.
- The lights?
- Over there.
Damn!
They have you in their sights.
We never come out.
Do not be pessimistic.
This is my education.
Sorry you came so far.
Tell him ...
No question of refusing!
Let go of my daughter!
Mom!
Do not scream or I'll shoot.
What are you doing?
I dig into your business.
Who paid you
for the bill?
The countries involved in the project.
It's an American tradition.
Victor and Thyme have it mounted.
I co-signed
to make me out to the Senate.
And you paid this house
cash, no receipts.
American tradition, Frank?
Do not tell me
you make ...
- You are assured, is not it?
- No.
Come on ...
<i> left for debate. </ i>
It is <i> 4: 45 pm. </ i>
<i> The sun rises in 20 minutes. </ i>
After you, lady-killer.
- It will be safe outside?
- More here.
Mikhail!
You're dead!
This is where it happens, eh?
No bailiffs Congress
under the bed?
Fascinating.
Come on, come on!
- Where?
- Over there.
Down?
Where you go? Come back here.
I wanted
smoking a cigarette outside.
Do not play stupid.
You know the house, not me.
I will not be very useful, handcuffed.
You had planned an evening?
What is happening here?
I see that ...
The object of affection.
Go upstairs, Ben.
Will help men Red-Al.
No way.
You've paid
to monitor Traveres.
That's your fight.
You're right.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I'll kill you!
Come see the men in your life.
Damage for insurance.
Veins here.
Come!
I come from.
- Wait! Where does that lead?
- In the attic.
Not so fast!
You want to jump?
Here!
Shit!
You put
all your money in there, huh?
There
10 million for insulation.
Come!
Come this way.
You're a Boy Scout?
I want the medal of merit.
Shit!
The cavalry ...
Come.
Here!
Mr. O'Neill?
Danny!
Stay here.
Let her go.
You can do nothing.
The police is low.
There is no escape.
Defuse ...
it, Mr. O'Neill.
Species of dung!
Get out! Get out!
The scale, fast!
I'm here.
I love you, darling.
I know.
We take care of everything, pull yourself together.
You want something?
An increase.
Forget.
You're a mess.
Really.
Where have you been?
Frankly?
I programmed Madonna
to request an increase.
My wife. I want my wife.
I'm here.
