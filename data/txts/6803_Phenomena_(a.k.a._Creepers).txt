Hey!
<i>Stop!</i>

Hello!
Is anyone home?
Is anyone home?
I'm a foreigner.
And I'm lost.
I know someone's there.
Please
Well, this is quite a revelation
to me, professor.
I mean, I had no idea
an expert on insects,
could provide the police with such
invaluable help in a homicide investigation.
Normally we don't, but I made the
unfortunate error of becoming
an expert on cadaveric <i>corner.</i>
I seek of the...
John, We're not going through that
whole number again, aren't we?
Oh yes we are, just like we did
the first time you came here.
almost years ago.
<i>Do you remember</i>
the first case we solved together.
When a dead body is exposed
to the elements.
Sooner or later, it
<i>will be eaten</i> by insects.
Hey!
You naughty girl!
Hey.
Where did you get this?
You knew it could cut yourself.
Look. Look here
You'll cut yourself with this.
See? It's not a toy.
Not a toy.
Where did you find it?
Outside?
And who, may I ask,
put it out there?
I don't want you ever,
ever playing with this again.
Oh, I forgot to introduce you.
This is Inga.
She's my nurse.
If I pick out something with
my laser...
she never forgets it.
She's also my friend, too.
Aren't you, lnga?
But she is a very good nurse.
Insects that eat cadavers are
divided into eight groups.
Eight groups of insects
that follow one another.
And stalling themselves
at exact moments.
And on precise turn.
Never sooner and never later.
We call them the
eight squadrons of death.
First, comes a common fly.
Lays its eggs
on the rotting corpse
And thus the cycle is begins.
Each group stays fifteen days.
Fifteen, you multiply it by eight,
The number of the groups.
It's a ...
Four months.
In the case of this head,
Cycle are not only seems
to be complete,
But have been repeated.
I suppose is at a...
Eight months.
Now I see.
By calculating the presence
and the growth
of the flies or the maggots,
you can pinpoint the exact...
date of death.
Or murder.
So our victim was decapitated
some 8 months ago.
And 15 days.
Aren't you forgetting something?
15 days while the body was
submerged in the lake,
Before the putrefying gas is brought it
to the surface and then vanish to the shore.
When the first flies arrive.
Eight and a half months then
Perhaps a little less.
The mount wind, that is foehn,
was unusually warm this year.
So we could say that she...
lost her head
somewhere between
September 7th and 10th.
Am I right, John?
Let's see, in about that time...
first girl that dissapear...
that per September 9th...
Fourteen-year-old Danish
tourist, named Vera Brandt.
The body was never found.
Just like the other girl.
Like Greta.
Poor Greta.
She is on that list too.
She is missing alright,
but we have no proof...
she's dead.
-After finding this,
What's the use of
hiding from the facts?
There's a killer.
A vicious killer.
Girl killer.
We'll get him...
when we do.
Good night, professor.
Do you know this part of the country?
No, this is my first trip to Europe.
It's a very unusual area.
People call it...
'The Swiss Transylvania.'.
Why?
Oh, I don't know. They just do.
So, you are the Corvino girl.
You father is terribly...
-Yes, isn't he.
I admire him very much.
I thought he might have come with you.
No, Dad's working in the Philippines.
He'll be there for almost a year.
He can't even be reached by telephone.
Well in any case.
He's placed you in good hands.
You know I'm sure you are
going to like our school.
To begin with, we all speak english.
And the our academic program
is based on the american one.
Ah, a bee.
Be careful it may sting you.
No!
Leave it alone!
Look out!
No, don't kill it!
Please!
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!
Stop yelling.
It's a bee!
-I know.
It won't hurt me.
Insects never hurt me.
I love them.
-You, you love them?
-Yes
I love all insects.
And so Jennifer arrives in Switzerland,
from the new world,
to pass her first memorable night...
at the Richard Wagner
International School for Girls.
Take her bags in, please!
Impressive, isn't it?
The estate was once Richard Wagner's home.
The school only occupies the main building.
The others are closed because they're not safe.
Never go into them.
Ever.
Come along.
I'm starved.
Is there anything to eat?
No, sorry.
Because of the time changes
I haven't eaten anything...
but breakfast for two days.
What are they?
Baby food.
My parents left it when they came to
visit me with my little brother.
Meat.
Mix vegetables.
He's seven months old.
I bet he is the only male who has
ever seen the inside of this place.
Mix vegetables is great. I'm vegetarian.
I need a, um,
-Spoon? No.
How is it?
Like cat food.
By the way,
I'm Sophie. I'm French.
Jennifer.
-Hi.
Have you met the headmistress yet?
Speaking of the devil...
You are the new girl.
You were expected this afternoon.
My plane was late
because of bad weather.
Would you like some?
The school has its rules.
I'm sorry, but I must confiscate this.
Hey wait. You don't know who that is. That's...
That's Paul Corvino.
Sophie that is enough. Get into bed!
And if I catch you...
smoking again, you'll be sorry.
And you young lady, to bed.
And switch off the light.
That bitch stealing Paul Corvino.
Yeah. It's all right.
I have a bunch of them in my bag.
So tomorrow I put them
all up all over the room.
I've seen all his movies
I saw his last one three times.
Lucky you. He must have made
me zip through it ...
at least 15 times.
He said he trust my opinion.
You mean you know him?
Yes, of course I do.
Have you been to bed with him?
Paul Corvino is my father.
Oops, sorry.
It's all right.
Your mother lives in India and owned a hotel.
She remarried.
Your father never did.
You were only 7 when they split up.
No, I was 8.
-Eight? You were 7!
How do you know so much
about Paul Corvino?
I've read Scener Review.
Oh!
Well, it was christmas day,
And we were opening
presents together.
And the phone rings.
So, Mom answered it.
And she said
'I'll be right there'.
And it was her lover.
So then she left...
and she never came back.
But I remember that Dad
got 12 presents that year.
And he said the 13th is Mom
walking out on him like that.
You didn't read that in
Scener Review, did you?
You know I'm really glad you're here.
I've always had to sleep alone.
It can be very scary.
Thanks for coming.
I am the one who should thank you.
Don't let me forget.
I owe you a meal.
You know,
There is a murder around here.
A crazy man. A maniac who...
kidnaps girls our age and kills them.
and then he hides the bodies.
Could we change the subject?
I need my sleep.
I'm really tired from the trip.
You're right.
Sometimes I lay awake all night
thinking about it.
What do you think about
before you fall asleep?
My father.
If I thought about your father
I'd never get any sleep.
You mind if I watch TV?
I've got earphones.
No problem, good night, Sophie.
Good night, Jennifer.
She's okay?
Are you hurt?
Why are you dress like that?
Do you understand me?
Hey, do you understand me?
Let me go.
Cut it out!
Sit still here, shit!
Is this the first time
you've been sleepwalking?
No. It happened before
in the states.
(you can mess out)
Have you any idea where you've been?
No. It's all black.
I never remember anything.
My savior.
-So you're an American?
I am studying at the academy.
Where are you from?
I am from Scotland.
I came here as student ...
then stayed to teach,
Then I had this accident and...
I haven't moved since.
What do you teach?
-Entomology.
Study insects.
-Really?
Do insects interest you?
-Yeah. A lot!
I love them.
You mean that?
Absolutely!
Why?
You remind me of another girl.
Greta. She used to come here
sometimes, help out.
Mostly secretarial work. And then...
Then?
She was supposed to come here one night.
She never arrived.
The killer got her?
How do you know about that?
Well, you used the past tense
As if she was dead.
She left a coat here, er...
You must be frozen, child.
It should fit you.
It's upstairs.
Here I sh...
She'll show you where it is.
Wait a second!
Wait! Wait!
Now, don't play any tricks...
Bulls eye!
Well, beats me
it's that never misses.
This species is supposed
to be practically blind.
Thanks.
Be careful, you are in range.
Won't do anything to me.
You're like Greta in that coat.
She liked insects too.
But they didn't like her
the way that one likes you.
That sound...that you can
hear is a mating call
You're exciting it.
Smell it!
Really?
-Yes, smell.
It's...sort of sweet.
That substance is secreted by a gland.
It tears is meant to attract the mate.
You now exciting him and
he is doing his best...
to excite you.
To think we only just met.
It isn't the mating season.
I don't understand.
I've never seen anything
like it before.
Oh, thanks for everything.
Stop by anytime.
Night.
To make an old man happy...
take the cable car.
It is only a five minutes ride from town.
I don't know. Maybe.
And mind how you go...with that sleepwalking.
If it happens to you again...
you must say...
'I am sleepwalking, I must wake up'.
'I am sleepwalking, I must wake up'.
I am sleepwalking, I must wake up.
I am sleepwalking ...
I won't need it.
Haven't had an attack for ages.
Must have been the trip out.
Or maybe the change of air.
Maybe the wind.
The wind, yes.
The foehn, very particular wind.
Typical of this part of the country.
It comes from the Alps.
A blast of warm air
cause snow avalanches.
Make the flowers grow,
the hatching of the larvae.
Some people get headaches.
Upon it blows, there are goes who say
it causes madness.
It's a strange part of the country.
The Swiss Transylvania.
Would someone please tell me
what this EEG is supposed to do?
What you did last night is
highly irregular.
No student ever left the
school at night before.
How many times do I have to tell you that
I didn't walk out on purpose.
I walked in my sleep.
It happens.
But it is not normal.
It's our duty to know more.
But I know everything
there is to know about it.
I've been examined by the best.
It is not an illness.
But this could leading up to
something far more serious.
You say you remember nothing?
This not a matter of
talking in your sleep,
Or ransacking the fridge.
It could be leading up to a new personality...
trying to emerge.
Sometimes it's the first step...
on the path to schizophrenia.
So you think I'm crazy, huh?
Well you can forget your EEG.
There now.
Calm down, calm down.
Ok, ok, go ahead.
I'll show you which one...
of us is crazy.
(What is going on?)
(That is strange.)
Do you suffer from epilepsy or
do you take something like...
do you understand, drugs?
I am not crazy,
schizophrenic,
epileptic,
or stoned.
Hello, Shapiro Evans?
Hi, um, I'd like to speak to Moris please?
I mean Mr. Shapiro.
Jennifer Corvino.
Right. Paul Corvino's daughter.
He is out of town?
Three days?
What do you mean it's a holiday?
What holiday is it?
Passover.
Hey, have you heard,
she walks in her sleep.
Walks in the sleep?
If you ask me, she's got problem.
So that's Paul Corvino's daughter.
That still doesn't give her the right
to be such a show off.
Here she comes.
What's wrong?
-Damn Morris.
Who is he?
Your boyfriend?
No. He's my father's
agent and attorney.
I want the tumb to get me
out of this shitty school...
He found it.
Why do you want to leave?
Your little brother isn't the
only male to disgrace this place.
First you forgot the doctor.
He's not a man.
He's got more hands than...
the entire basketball team.
Second you forgot the killer.
The killer?
What is the poet trying to say ...
with these words?
Well, who is going to answer?
You, tell us.
Me?
-Yes you, Elisabeth.
I think the poet took the words...
right out of a Bee Gees song.
That's very funny.
The poet in question is Abraham Kouli...
What if the killer saw me?
I am really scared.
-I would be too.
Can you imagine if I walk
in my sleep again tonight...
I went right into him?
Please promise you keep
an eye on me tonight.
And lock the door.
And if you hear me get up
to do anything...
wake me.
Promise?
Please say yes.
Sophie? You tell us!
Me?
-Yes, stand up.
The poet with its oracular style...
The poet with its oricular style...
Oracular style!
-Oracular style.
tells us of the danger we face,
should we forget...
the sense and the meaning
of the past.
tells us of the danger we face,
should we forget...
the sense and the meaning
of the past.
And do you believe that danger exists?
Screw the past.
Screw the past.
Well done, Sophie.
Silence.
And what about ancient greece? Shakespeare?
Ok.
I'll keep an eye on you tonight.
Richard Wagner?
Richard Gere?
You like it?
-Nice! Where it comes from?
I put in on by mistake.
Guess who it belongs to?
Paul Corvino's daughter.
-The actor?
Yes. Her name is Jennifer
and she's my roommate.
Huh, Alright.
Oh yes, he's fantastic.
All those muscles.
Not him, Her!
What is she like?
Oh, she is pretty.
She wears her hair like mine.
You know, I have to watch her at night.
Because she walks in her sleep.
Walks in her sleep?
-Yeah!
She gets up and she walks, like this.
Really, Sophie. I have to go.
I have to join my regiment at dawn.
And you know it's nearly three hours trip.
Oh, come on, stay a while longer.
-I can't. I really have to go.
You shit.
What did you say?
-I said Fuck you!
Sleepwalking... I must...
I must wake up.
Sophie.
The police came this morning.
My pal the headmistress...
told them not to believe
anything I say...
because she thinks I'm crazy.
Maybe you think
I'm crazy too, dad.
If production never get
this letter to you.
I mean there's really
nothing I could do.
I was so scared that
I couldn't say anything about...
what I saw, or why I screamed.
So you think the glove
belongs to the killer?
Yeah! I'm sure of it.
But why the maggots?
The larvae.
You give me time
I'll identify them.
I'll be able to give
you an answer.
Perhaps to some other
questions as well.
You will, professor.
Oh sir, I do know the way.
Jennifer.
-Hm?
You're forgetting your notebooks.
Thanks.
Have you any idea, why they behave like that?
Never have done this before.
I guess they sense the mood I'm in.
I'm often in a bad mood.
Upset about something,
but they don't carry on like this.
In ancient Greece the butterfly
symbolized the soul.
The so-called psyche.
From the greek, butterfly-psyche.
What is this association between
insects and the human soul?
Is it because of the multivaries
mystery of them both.
And we know something
about them, don't we?
Okay.
See that glove.
An insect, a firefly led me to it.
The police came to the school.
They asked me lots of questions.
But I didn't tell them
how I found the glove.
I don't want them
to think I was crazy.
You can tell me,
I'm not the police.
What happened?
I was standing alone
in the dark, and...
I needed help.
And a firefly.
It was like it heard me...
And it answered
my call.
You've calmed them down,
just by telling that.
That's ridiculous.
It's new.
That's say is some self...
discovered to science.
If you only knew
the things I've discovered.
Things my fellow scientists...
considered absurd.
Extrasensory perception,
the paranormal powers,
that are unusual
in human beings,
are perfectly natural in insects.
Some species communicate
with each other...
over vast distances,
like telepathy.
This little creatures have
enormous power.
I could give you multitude of examples.
I wrote a book about
this very subject.
You may have it.
It's perfectly normal for insects...
to be slightly telepathic.
Yeah, it's normal for insects.
But am I normal?
Jennifer!
But, why me?
Fräulein Corvino can not
be left alone.
I want someone in here
with her.
And I want to know everything
she says and does.
I'm scared of her.
She arrived and Sophie disappeared.
Plus she's crazy.
Listen to this.
'Dear dad...'
Ah, here it is.
'Do you remember what
the doctor said about...
sleepwalking manifest
in a split personality?
It's true.
My second personality is emerging.
Do you know how?
I communicate with insects.
'I mean I've discovered,
I have power over them.
I'm not kidding.
I even have a witness.
The famous entomologist
John McGregor...
who lives near here.
We've become friends...'
You see, she is crazy.
This, is mine!
Hey Jennifer listen!
-What?
I'm a spider!
Look I'm a spider
And when I speak
you should be obey!
No. Stop it. Stop it.
I'm a killer-spider.
That's called insects.
I'm a mosquito.
I'm a fly.
We worship you.
We worship you.
We worship you.
We worship you.
Now, that's enough, girls!
We worship you.
We worship you.
We worship you.
I love you.
I love you all.
I love all of you.
She's still asleep.
I called an ambulance to have
her taken to the mental hospital.
They'll be her any minute.
At least they'll be...
better equipped to keep her calm.
But, is she insane?
Well, she is not normal.
She is diabolic.
Diabolic?
-Yes!
Yes, the bible also refers
to the devil as Beelzebub.
Which means
Lord of the Flies.
Look at her.
The Lady of the Flies.
Call me as soon as
she wakes up.
Diabolic?
Hey, Does Jennifer look like
a devil to you, huh?
No, you're not the devil.
The only devil around here
is the killer.
But I understand how you
must be feeling.
I know what it feels like to be different.
And the conditions that go with it.
Pity, irony, repulsion, annoyance.
People have the ability to
make you almost hate yourself.
There's a big difference between
you and me.
When that car bashed into me...
I lost something. But you,
you gained something.
You are in a position to do
extraordinary things...
with that gift of you.
Come on, I wanna show you
something.
Come on, lnga.
Look. These were inside the glove.
The larvae of the great sarcophagus.
Rather a menacing name.
Appropriate to the insect that bears it.
It lives exclusively of dead bodies.
Human remains.
The great sarcophagus?
What a weird name.
A destroyer. A flesh eater.
It is capable of picking up...
the scent of a dead body
over vast distances.
It's sensory reception is extraordinary.
Quite unique.
But why do the gloves have
so many larvae then?
Perhaps because...
when the murderer hides his victims...
he likes to keep in
physical contact with them.
Conserving them.
He is a psychopath.
If we need to get him...
we have to call on the services...
of the 2 greatest detectives ever known.
Perhaps I should say,
unknown... up to now.
Who were they?
-You. And him.
The great sarcophagus.
Spread your hand.
Eh.
See. He's not afraid of you.
He won't do that for me.
Ask him to lead you
where the dead bodies are hidden.
And he'll lead you.
That fly is your magic wand.
You think it will work?
With your gift.
It'll take a lifetime.
It could be anywhere.
Not anywhere.
On a 52 kilometer route.
The first girl to disappear...
was a danish tourist.
She took a bus of the red line.
It starts on the city square
on a 52 kilometer route.
Calling at various tourist traps
on the way.
She was seen
getting on that bus.
When you get near to the killer's house,
You'll know about it soon enough
because the sarcophagus...will go crazy,
And head straight for the dead body.
All you have to do is follow him...
and come straight back.
Do you feel up to it?
Yeah!
I want him caught.
For Sophie.
She was my friend.
And I want him caught...for Greta.
I wish you all the luck in the world,
my two detectives.
Wait!
Wait, please!
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Um... I was following the...
Who are you?
-You came here to steal, did you?
-No! Um...
I was looking for someone.
You were looking for someone?
Come on, the house is empty.
No one is lived here.
Since the former tenant moved out
8 months ago.
The house is for sale.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to cause any harm.
May I help you?
Who are you?
I am the estate agent.
If you are looking for a house,
I am your man.
Anyone living in the house now?
No. By the way,
where did you come from?
I didn't hear you drive up.
I came from the back.
How long has the house been empty?
I don't know.
7 or 8 months maybe.
Who was living here before?
I would have to check
at the agency.
But we do not give out
that kind of information.
It's absolutely confidential
and against our company...
I'm Inspector Geiger, Kantonspolizei.
Right, lnga. You locked yourself out
you silly god old...
This damn machine.
I wonder what is going on here?
Who's that?
Is someone there?
Eh, what...Hey?
Who, who is it?
Hey, answer me.
Who are... Who are you?
Most of our patients are kept
under restraint.
Take my word for it inspector.
The person you're looking for...
is not one of ours.
No one's ever escaped from here.
Correct.
But I'm working from the exact...
opposite assumption.
How can I explain?
It isn't as if someone got out
of your institution...
but rather got in.
You have had such a case I believe?
Yes, a curious incident.
It happened about 15 years ago.
Here on our basement level.
Since then it has only been accessible
from members of our staff.
The more down one goes
in this place...
the more monstrous
the inmates become.
Probably the same in hell.
Until you reach the last circle.
The one without a center.
Shit Morris. I'm telling you.
I won't stay here a minute longer.
I wanna come home and...
I don't have the money
for a ticket.
No, I run away from school.
Cause they want to lock me
in the institution.
What?
It's a long story.
Get me back to LA...
and I tell you all about it.
Which bank do you use in Zurich?
The SKA, what it is stand for?
Gutten Tag.
Send me some money.
A telex money.
Do it Morris,
I don't wanna be murdered.
Yes, I said murdered.
Someone here wants to kill me.
And he's tried once already.
I am sorry,
there is nothing here in your name.
Are you sure?
- I'm afraid so.
Well maybe it's just arrived then
hasn't come to the computers yet?
I can check.
There's nothing, I'm sorry.
Now what am I supposed to do?
This is an emergency.
It could arrive at any time.
Look, why don't you come back later.
Where can I go in the mean time?
Can I wait here?
-Sure you can wait over there.
But I suggest you go for a walk.
I'll wait.
Hello Jennifer.
Your father's attorney,
Mr. Shapiro...
called us from New York.
He was very worried about you...
and extremely angry with us for...
let's say, loosing you.
What a bastard.
He sounded very reasonable on the phone.
He spoke to me and only calmed down...
when I told him I would come for you myself.
He said I would find you here.
I'm not going back to that school.
Of course not.
He said you want to go back to...
America immediately, is that true?
Yes.
-Well.
He authorized me to buy you a ticket...
and give you some money.
Is that all right?
Ok.
-Good.
Good Luck.
What time is my flight?
Twelve noon, tomorrow.
The last flight of the day has already left.
And what about tonight?
-I'm not gonna sleep at the school.
I'm not going back there,
I'm not gonna sleep there,
I never wanna see the place again.
Don't worry, if that's what you want,
it's all right.
Mr. Shapiro said to do whatever you want.
You can stay with me tonight.
It's enormous.
Do you live here alone?
No.
You'll sleep in here, Jennifer.
I hope you find it comfortable enough.
Looks fine, thank you.
Why are the mirrors covered like that?
I told you I don't live alone.
I have a small son.
He is very sick.
I covered the mirrors for his sake.
He doesn't want to see his reflection.
I worry about him very much.
He's changed my life completely.
Sometimes I think he's driving me crazy.
I'm sorry.
These are things that can happen
in a woman's life.
But don't worry.
You won't see him.
Oh, I don't mind if...
-No. It's better if you don't.
He stays in his room with his
crazy thoughts.
Would you like something?
A cup of tea?
No, I don't wanna bother you.
-Ah, It's no bother.
I, I'm sorry,
I kicked the train by mistake.
It hit him.
Maybe he's hurt?
Hurt?
Don't grab him like that.
Why not?
What on earth are you thinking?
This is my son?
It's only a doll.
You are a very sensitive young lady.
Are you frightened?
No.
-Yes, you are.
I can see it in your eyes.
You're burning up.
You'll have a fever.
No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.
In this part of the country,
with this wind,
It's hardly surprising.
I'll get you a pill.
You don't want to leave
with a cold tomorrow, do you?
Imagine what Mr. Shapiro would say.
You should take them both,
but if you prefer, one is enough.
I don't want any pills.
Where is the bathroom?
The bathroom is over there.
And you will take the pills!
Do as you're told.
You are my responsibility.
All right I'll take the pills.
I'll get you some water.
I can get it myself.
Shit.
Get out of the way.
May I close the door?
What a bitch.
Larvae of the great sarcophagus,
it lives exclusively of dead bodies,
Human remains.
Poison!
Jennifer, what are you doing?
Poison!
Jennifer, answer me!
Open the door!
I said what are you doing.
Answer me, Jennifer,
Open the door this instant!
Open the door!
Answer me!
How dare you behave like this.
Jennifer!
Let me in!
Let me in!
Why didn't you open the door?
What were you doing?
Did you take the pills?
What were you doing?
Help!
Help!
15 years ago, when you were still
working in Basel.
you were assaulted?
Surely you haven't forgotten the incident.
No.
Look at this.
He pulled me to him through the bars.
There were bars between us.
I understand Frau Bruckner forgive me.
But we have to be precise.
So you moved here 8 months ago.
Is that correct?
Yes that is so, Inspector.
Please, come this way.
And where were you living before that?
Outside Zürich.
Perhaps the murderer hides his victims.
He likes to keep in
physical contact with them.
Conserving them.
He's a psychopath.
Mr. Shapiro?
-Yes.
Your car rental agency.
Your car is right outside.
Here is the key.
Do you need a map, sir?
No, thank you,
I know the area.
Jennifer.
Don't be afraid.
I'm Inspector Geiger.
I want to help you.
Help me!
Thank you.
You fuckin' bitch!
You bitch!
I'll get you.
Go away. You scare me.
I won't hurt you.
I don't want you here.
I know your mother was bad.
But I wanna help.
You don't have to worry
about the mirrors anymore.
It's all over.
No, please!
No, please!
No!
Morris!
-Jennifer?
Thank God.
He was deceived
but he was my son.
And you killed him.
Why didn't I kill you before?
I killed that Inspector and
your Professor friend.
to protect him.
And now I'm gonna kill you,
to avenge him.
Why don't you call your insects
Go on! Call! Call!
