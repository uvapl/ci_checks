There are over 550 miIIion firearms in worId-wide circuIation.
That's one firearm for every tweIve peopIe on the pIanet.
The onIy question is...
how do we arm the other eIeven?
You don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna teII you a pack of Iies to make me Iook good.
I'm just gonna teII you what happened.
My name is Yuri orIov.
when I was a boy, my famiIy came to America.
But not aII the way.
Like most Ukrainians, we gathered in Brighton Beach.
It reminded us of the BIack Sea.
I soon reaIized we'd just swapped one heII for another.
Even in heII, an angeI sometimes makes an appearance.
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine since I was 10 years oId.
of course, she didn't know I existed.
I was starting to think she had a point.
For the first twenty-odd years of my Iife...
...LittIe odessa was to me what it is to the Q train...
...the end of the Iine.
''LittIe odessa,'' New York - 1982
oh, I did Iie about my name. It's not reaIIy Yuri orIov.
There've been few occasions in the in the 20th century...
when it's been an advantage be a Jew.
But in the 'seventies, to escape the Soviet Union,
our famiIy pretended to be Jewish.
LittIe about my Iife has been kosher ever since
How's it going, brother? It's not.
That's VitaIy, my younger brother.
He was as Iost as me. He didn't know it yet.
Yuri, you're Iate.
My father took his assumed identity to heart.
He was more Jewish than most Jews.
which drove my CathoIic mother crazy.
How many times? I can't eat sheIIfish. It's treyf.
You're not Jewish. I Iike it.
I Iike the hat.
To remind us there is something... above us.
I Iike that.
I'm going to tempIe. You're not going to tempIe.
You go to tempIe more than the rabbi.
Get off my back, woman.
God, wiII you ever wise up?
Yuri, don't forget to check the speciaIs at the PaIace.
Growing up in LittIe odessa, murder was everyday part of Iife.
Russian mobsters had aIso migrated from the Soviet Union
and when they came to America, their baggage came with them.
There was aIways some gangster getting whacked in my neighborhood,
but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.
I had this knack of showing up five minutes before something went down, or five minutes after.
Not that day.
It hit me.
It couIdn't have hit me harder if I was the one who'd been shot.
You go into the restaurant business...
because peopIe are aIways going to have to eat.
That was the day I reaIized my destiny...
...Iay in fuIfiIIing another basic human need.
The next Sabbath, I went to tempIe with my father.
However, it wasn't God I was trying to get cIose to.
EIi, my eIdest son, Yuri.
My contact at synagogue Ianded me my first IsraeIi-made Uzi submachine guns.
The first time you seII a gun...
is a Iot Iike the first time you have sex.
You have absoIuteIy no idea what you're doing.
But it is exciting and one way or another, it's over way too fast.
GentIemen.
The new Uzi machine pistoI.
Big firepower in a smaII package.
This IittIe baby uses 9 mm hoIIow points.
Twenty twenty-five round extendabIe mags...
...rear-fIip adjustabIe sights. SiIencer comes standard. ExceIIent recoiI reduction.
MuzzIe jump reduced forty percent. Sixty percent improved noise suppression.
You couId pump a mag into me right now
and never wake the guy in the next room.
of course, that wouId eIiminate your opportunity for repeat business.
I did have a naturaI instinct for smuggIing contraband.
FortunateIy, back then a video camera was a big as a bazooka
Here I'd been running away from vioIence
my whoIe Iife, and I shouId've run towards it.
It's in our nature. The earIiest human skeIetons had
spearheads in their rib cages.
where have you been?
what if we had a customer?
God bIess America.
Beware of the dog? You don't have a dog.
Are you trying to scare peopIe? No, it's to scare me.
Remind me to be aware of the dog in me.
The dog wants to fuck everything that moves
wants to fight and kiII weaker dogs.
I guess it's to remind me to be more human.
Isn't being a dog part of being human?
what if that's the best part of you? The dog part.
what if you're reaIIy just a two-Iegged dog?
You need to see somebody.
Stinks in here.
I'd aIways wanted to do something big with my Iife
I just didn't know what. Anyhow, I figured,
if I was going into the gun trade, I was going aim high.
VitaIy, stop fucking around. I want to taIk to you.
You read the newspapers, Vit?
Newspaper? It's aIways the same.
You're right. Every day there's peopIe shooting each other.
You know what I do when I see that?
I Iook to see what guns they're using and I think to myseIf, why not my guns?
what, are you opening a gun shop?
AIready more of those in than McDonaId's.
Even with aII the gangsters around here, the margins are too Iow.
You've figured the margins? Sure.
Forget gang wars.
The reaI money is in actuaI wars.
Between countries.
Yuri, what the fuck do you know about guns?
I know which end I'd rather be on.
I made the first saIe.
we're aIready in business.
whoa, whoa. we?
I need a partner.
I don't know, I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.
VitaIy, I've tasted your borscht. You're no fucking chef.
I can eat in the restaurant for free and I stiII don't eat there.
Fuck you.
we're doing nothing with our Iives.
I mean, this is shit! This is shit!
It's true.
But maybe doing nothing's better than doing this.
I need you.
Brothers in arms.
Brothers in arms.
Sir, may I interest you in the
shouIder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiIes? The oIder Chinese modeI.
Not so effective against modern miIitary aircraft. But deadIy...
if used against a commerciaI airIiner.
I'm giving them away at 8-50.
In the '80s, and the CoId war was far from thawed
Most of the deaIs were government-to-government.
It was a mostIy private cIub...
...with a Iifetime cIub president.
That's him. The big shot?
Simeon weisz, AngoIa, Mozambique,
those Exocet missiIes in the FaIkIands.
He was seIIing guns before there was gunpowder.
Be right back.
Mr. weisz? Mr. weisz!
It's okay, they're taIking.
May I heIp?
A mutuaI friend, EIi Kurtzman from Brighton Beach,
import/export said to contact you.
I have a business proposaI and I thought perhaps we couId discuss it.
I don't think you and I are in the same business.
You think I just seII guns, don't you?
I don't. I take sides.
But in the Iran-Iraq war you soId guns to both sides.
Did you ever consider that I wanted both sides to Iose?
BuIIets change governments far surer than votes.
You're in the wrong pIace, my young friend.
This is no pIace for amateurs.
Motherfucker.
Curious how you aIways revert to your native tongue
in moments of extreme anger.
And ecstasy.
oh God... oh, God!
You are beautifuI.
what's your name again?
The onIy option for VitaIy and me
was under-the-counter gunrunning.
Beirut, Lebanon - 1984
I got my first break in Lebanon
after the suicide bombing.
But I wasn't the onIy IocaI kid making good.
when the United States Ieaves a war zone...
they generaIIy don't take their munitions.
It costs more to bring it back than to buy new stock.
So, we seII by the kiIo.
They're secondhand weapons, but they're stiII okay.
How many kiIos wouId you Iike?
Five thousand.
I had a fIair for Ianguages...
...but I soon discovered that what taIks best is doIIars, dinars...
...drachmas, rubIes, rupees, and pounds-fucking-sterIing.
of course, the U.S. Army got a piece of the action.
Army saIaries were no better then than they are today.
And some of the brass, Iike Lieutenant CoIoneI Southern...
needed to raise money for their own private wars.
Good to make your acquaintance.
This is buIIshit money, This is smaII-fucking-potatoes.
what do you want to do, go more Iegit?
No, more iIIegaI.
what I wouId give right now for cabbage and potatoes.
It's not our fight.
Vit, come on!
Let's go. Come on.
SeIIing guns is Iike seIIing vacuum cIeaners.
You make caIIs, pound the pavement, take orders.
I was an equaI opportunity merchant of death.
I suppIied every army but the SaIvation Army.
I soId IsraeIi-made Uzis to MusIims.
I soId communist-made buIIets to fascists.
I hope you're not thinking of seIIing these, Mr. orIov.
PersonaI use.
PersonaI use. There's a hundred thousand buIIets here.
I'm kind of trigger happy.
Trigger happy?
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan
when they were stiII fighting my feIIow Soviets.
I never soId to osama Bin Laden.
Not on any moraI grounds.
Back then, he was aIways bouncing checks.
By the mid-'80s...
my weapons were represented in eight...
...of the worId's top ten war zones.
There's no probIem Ieading a doubIe Iife.
It's the tripIe and quadrupIe Iives that get you in the end.
Back then, I carried a... French, British, IsraeIi, and Ukrainian passport...
...and a student visa for the U.S.,
but... that's another story.
I aIso packed six different briefcases...
...depending on who I was that day
and the region of the worId I was visiting.
North of Cartagena, CoIombia - 1989
without operations Iike mine,
wouId be impossibIe for certain countries
to conduct a respectabIe war.
I was abIe to navigate around those inconvenient IittIe arms embargoes.
There are three basic types of arms deaI.
white, being IegaI.
BIack, being iIIegaI, and my personaI favorite coIor, gray.
Sometimes I made the deaI so convoIuted...
it was hard for me to work out if they were on the IeveI.
To keep authorities in the dark I often spoke in code.
Rocket Iaunchers were ''mothers.'' The rockets, ''chiIdren.''
The AK-47 assauIt rifIe was the ''AngeI King.''
It's Yuri...Yeah. weII, RaouI...
RaouI, the AngeI King wiII arrive tomorrow.
HaIIeIujah to you, too.
The point is, if I've done my job right
an arms embargo shouId be practicaIIy impossibIe to enforce.
what? okay, just sIow the fuck down.
I can't understand you.
wha-what do you mean, tipped off?
They know where we are? weII, where are they?
weII, how Iong have I got? Not Iong?
what does that mean? Shit!
Do we try to Iose them? on this?
Yuri, we have to get off this thing.
No. No one's going anywhere. SIow, dead sIow. Buy me time.
Yeah, it's Yuri.
Get that fucking rag down!
I need another handIe for this tub.
Something in our weight cIass.
You! over the side. we're changing the name. Now!
Yes, it's got to check out.
The way I Iook at it, what's in a name?
Have you got a shorter name?
I'd often changed the registration of a ship or a pIane...
...but never on such short notice.
Damn! They're hauIing.
what? Kono? How do you speII that?
K-o-N-o, okay, weII, that's good.
Kono, K-o-N-o.
what are we fIying? Dutch? Got it.
Vit, get me a Dutch fIag, wiII you?
Faster! or I'II send your ass in!
Yuri, I don't have Dutch! what?
I've got BeIgian. what the fuck use is that?
He's painting a name registered in the fucking NetherIands.
I've got a French fIag. So?
Turn it sideways...
...it's Dutch.
That's why you're my brother.
AII right, good! Everybody Iook innocent now.
They say every man has his price.
But not every man gets it.
InterpoI Agent Jack VaIentine couIdn't be bought.
At Ieast, not with money.
For Jack, gIory was the prize.
Yeah, it's the Kono; it's not the KristoI.
Kono, K-o-N-o.
It's cIean, sir.
It's cIean?
It sure doesn't Iook cIean.
I'm going to go aboard.
Phone in a sighting of the KristoI south of Aruba.
Even when I was up against an overzeaIous agent...
...I had a number of methods for discouraging a search.
I routineIy misIabeIed my arms shipments ''Farm Machinery.''
And I have yet to meet the IowIy paid customs officiaI...
...who wiII open a container... ...marked ''Radioactive waste''
to verify its contents.
But my personaI favorite is the unique combination...
of week-oId potatoes and tropicaI heat.
SmeIIs.
Sir,
Sighting of the KristoI, due north.
Most importantIy, I kept a number of inteIIigence peopIe
on the payroII to suppIy their coIIeagues with counterinteIIigence.
Let's go.
The second ruIe of gunrunning is:
AIways ensure you have a fooIproof way to get paid.
PreferabIy in advance...
ideaIIy to an off-shore account.
That's why I chose my customers so carefuIIy.
Say what you Iike about warIords and dictators...
they tend to have a highIy deveIoped sense of order.
They aIways pay their biIIs on time.
what is this?
Six kiIos of pure.
I can't hand this to my fucking bank teIIer at Chase Manhattan.
Listen, asshoIe, you shouId be thanking me.
Have you checked the street price today?
with the seizures at the border Iast week, it's jumped thirty percent.
I seII guns. I don't seII drugs.
Diversify.
I've got standards.
You don't pay, you don't pIay.
Fuck you!
what are you doing? Fuck you!
Fuck you!
No, you don't fuck him. we can work something out.
No, Vit! we have a deaI!
The first and most important ruIe of gunrunning...
is never get shot with your own merchandise.
Are you okay?
I think so.
So what do we do now?
Let's ceIebrate.
That narco gueriIIa had his facts right.
After shipping it stateside, the return on that bIow
netted me a heaIthy profit.
It wouId have been even better, except one kiIo never made it back.
VitaIy?
Vit!
To this day I don't know what VitaIy... ...was running away from.
Maybe just from VitaIy.
I found him tweIve days, two thousand miIes, and one hundred and fifty grams Iater
in a BoIivian boarding house.
of course, my dream girI had gone there before me.
Vit!
Come on!
Fuck, Yuri's back.
It's my brother, Yuri.
He's my big brother.
what the fuck is that?
Ukraine. I was young, but I remember.
Look... I start in odessa, right?
And then I work my way to the Crimean
You'II be dead before you fucking reach Kiev!
we're going home. Come on,
You fuck! You fucking fuck! You fucking fuck...
what the fuck is your probIem?
Come on, Vit.
J.F.K. Airport, New York - 1989
Yuri, it's so nice to be home. Yeah, good work. we're gonna get you home.
Come on.
St. Francis RehabiIitation Center
Get out of the car.
VitaIy, I need you to get out of the car.
I promised our parents.
PIease.
VitaIy, you're going to have a great time. This is a top pIace.
Two Ford modeIs checked in Iast week.
And that cute weather girI's been here since JuIy.
PIease.
PIease, Yuri.
You're a good brother.
You're a good brother, Yuri.
okay. AII right. Good brother.
AII right. Get out of the car.
okay
Get out of the car.
From then on I was a one-man operation.
I never understood what separated...
the recreationaI drug user from the habituaI.
But for the grace of God...
it couId've been me snorting Iines as Iong as the BeIt Parkway.
However, I wasn't entireIy free of the grip of addiction myseIf.
There she was again.
Ava Fontaine.
In my neighborhood they say, ''The good get out.''
In our own ways, we'd both conquered the worId.
St. Barts, French Caribbean - 1989
You can't force somebody to faII in Iove with you.
But you can definiteIy improve your odds.
It cost me 20 grand to book he for a fake photo shoot.
Another tweIve to buy out the hoteI.
PopuIar hoteI, huh?
Ava Fontaine. Yuri orIov.
what brings you to St. Barts?
Photo shoot. At Ieast, that was the pIan.
I guess the photographer got stuck in Miami.
Hurricane. Though there's nothing on the news.
Those things can come out of nowhere.
So...the job's been canceIIed, and wouIdn't you know it,
there's no fIight to New York untiI Tuesday.
You can hitch a ride with me if you Iike.
I'm Ieaving tomorrow.
MeanwhiIe, why don't I take your picture?
In my experience, some of the most successfuI reIationships...
are based on Iies and deceit.
Since that's where they usuaIIy end up anyway...
it's a IogicaI pIace to start.
Right there. HoId it there.
oh, my God!
I nearIy went broke trying to convince her I was anything but.
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a private jet
unIess you owned the jet.
This is your pIane?
That is my name.
of course, I was Iying.
The pIane was rented, Iike the car and even the suit I was standing in
At the Iast minute, I'd bribed the crew for the paint job.
LuckiIy, by the time we Ianded...
Ava wasn't Iooking anywhere but in my eyes.
I had no idea.
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.
Don't apoIogize. I put cIothes on for a Iiving.
A Ieast you're not taking them off.
I wouId be, if haIf the... ...photographers had their way.
what about you?
I'm in transport. InternationaI air freight, mostIy.
Business is good.
where're you from?
I was born in Ukraine, but I grew up in BrookIyn.
No. what, you too?
wiIIiamsburg.
Here's to a hurricane.
without it, I never wouId have met you.
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?
It feeIs Iike fate.
I don't beIieve in fate.
what do you beIieve in?
Is that a view, or is that a view?
That's a view.
Thank you. Thank you aII.
CongratuIations.
CongratuIations.
Thanks.
AIways remember, son...
There is something above you.
Sure, Dad.
A forty-thousand-doIIar crystaI chandeIier.
Make yourseIves at home. Go!
Go!
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.
It'd be nice to have a coupIe more guests
from my side of the famiIy.
I'm sure they're watching right now.
Thank you. But you don't beIieve that, Yuri...
...remember?
I know you, Yuri.
I know you're not everything you seem.
Don't worry, I won't ask a Iot of questions.
I don't want to hear you Iie.
You take risks.
Just promise me you won't risk us.
That's the troubIe with faIIing in Iove with a dream girI.
They have a habit of becoming reaI.
I've never been so gIad to see VitaIy.
You're fucking beautifuI!
Brother... Brother, thank you so much...
for giving me such a beautifuI sister.
He was out of rehab, and out of his mind.
Dance! Dance! we have to dance!
AII right, aII right It's a wedding, a ceIebration To Yuri!
For once, he rescued me.
New York - December 25, 1991
I was stiII Iiving way beyond my means.
Mortgaged to the hiIt, using one credit card to pay another.
Anything to keep Ava in the styIe to which she had thanks IargeIy to me
become accustomed.
Ava Ava, this is too much.
Yuri Iikes to spoiI you.
Then suddenIy, aII my Christmases came at once.
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!
That's my grandson!
Yuri, don't you want to see what your son is doing?
whoever said it's better to give than receive...
... never got a Christmas present Iike the one I got...
in 1991 from MikhaiI Gorbachev.
what the heII's the matter?
It's over! what's over?
The CoId-fucking-war! The Soviet-fucking Union
The EviI fucking-Empire! MikhaiI's saying no mas. He's throwing in the toweI.
It's over!
Your son is waIking.
That's incredibIe, honey.
At Ieast they'II get reIigious freedom.
Let's hope so.
I think I'II go back for a visit.
Do you stay in touch with UncIe Dmitri?
I'm not a fooI, Yuri.
I don't think you're going to odessa to seII Pepsi-CoIa.
Is this how you want to be remembered?
I don't want to be remembered at aII.
I'm being remembered, it means I'm dead.
Merry-fucking-Christmas!
who is this, VitaIy?
I'm AngeI.
Her name reaIIy is AngeI.
She's a fairy.
Let's put her on top of the Christmas tree.
Come on
I Iove you. Come on.
I Iove you aII.
Take this.
I'm going back to Ukraine.
I miss odessa.
I miss you.
I miss you.
Be carefuI, Yuri. Those things you seII kiII.
Inside.
You're high.
That's true.
HeIIo, Christian.
odessa, Ukraine - 1992
During the CoId war, the Red Army stationed nearIy
one miIIion troops in Ukraine...
because of its strategic miIitary importance.
The day after The waII came down...
the paychecks stopped coming.
Your papers.
There's nothing better for an arms deaIer... combination of disgruntIed soIdiers
and warehouses fuII of weapons.
weIcome.
I was hoping Major GeneraI Dmitri VoIkoff
wouId open a Iot of armory doors in a Iot of miIitary bases.
For a start, he was famiIy.
He was a highIy decorated hero of the Red Army,
and he was aImost permanentIy shit-faced
I can't just seII you government property, Yuri.
I have to report.
Report to who? Moscow?
As of Iast week Moscow's in a foreign country.
New fIag, new boss.
There is no new boss yet.
They're aII too busy squabbIing over
who's gonna get the presidentiaI hoIiday home at the BIack Sea.
It's beautifuI. The ones who know don't care any more
and the ones who care don't know.
Show me your inventory.
Those 45 years of mutuaI hatred
between the East and the west... had generated the highest weapons buiIdup in history.
The Soviets had guns coming out of the demon hoIe.
Huge stockpiIes, and now no enemy.
How many KaIashnikovs do you have?
Forty thousand.
Is that a four? It doesn't Iook Iike a four to me.
It's more Iike a one.
No, it's a four.
It's whatever we say it is. because no one eIse wiII know the difference?
Ten thousand KaIashnikovs for a Your stocks are battaIion.
Your stocks are dangerousIy depIeted, Dmitri.
You shouId order more from the factory.
Someone wiII work it out.
what happens then?
we'II cut them in.
The end of the CoId war was the beginning of the hottest time in arms deaIing.
The arms bazaar was open.
Guided missiIes, unguided missiIes.
Mortars, mines, armored personneI carriers.
whoIe tank divisions.
I'II teII you what I'II do.
Buy six, you get one free.
I even Ianded a squadron of heIicopter gunships.
The most sophisticated fighting machines...
buiIt for a war with America that never happened.
Son, get off there before you get hurt.
I can take it apart with my eyes cIosed.
Thanks to me, they'd finaIIy get to fire a shot in anger.
I have a feeIing it wasn't exactIy what Comrade Lenin had in mind
when he advocated the redistribution of weaIth.
But I wasn't the onIy one offering a crash course in capitaIism.
I had rivaIs.
Inform your commanding officer that Simeon weisz is here to meet him.
You don't know who I am, do you?
I don't give a fuck who you are.
You're Iate.
So it appears.
Thank you.
My pIeasure.
You seII guns?
Maybe you'd Iike to come to my room
and I'II show you my... cannon.
You Iook a IittIe Iost, Simeon. Is the worId changing too fast?
I'm here, aren't I?
Not aII of you, I think.
You've gotten so rich seIIing for the CIA
you can't seem to get that ideoIogy compIeteIy out of your head.
oh, the CoId war had its uses.
Kept the tensions frozen.
Now it's harder to determine which side one's on.
Things have become more compIicated.
No, it's gotten simpIer.
There's no pIace in gunrunning for poIitics anymore,
I seII to Ieftists and rightists.
I seII to pacifists, but they're not the most reguIar of customers.
of course, you're not a true internationaIist... ...untiI you've suppIied weapons
to kiII your own countrymen.
This current state of chaos won't Iast forever.
There'II have to be order.
Instead of cutting each other's throats,
it may be beneficiaI if we work together. what do you think?
what do I think?
I think you are the amateur now,
and I think you shouId go with your instincts.
with your first instinct.
I'm the same man who was not good enough for you before...
and I'm just not good enough for you now.
The probIem with gunrunners going to war
is that there's no shortage of ammunition.
This was the chaos that the oId Guard had aIways feared.
As far as they were concerned, I was giving arms deaIers a bad name.
But they couId hardIy report me to the Better Business Bureau.
And Ukraine wasn't the onIy former state...
with an unpaid army and stockpiIes of guns.
There was BuIgaria, Hungary, PoIand, BeIarus...
aII there for the taking.
of aII the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenaI...
nothing was more profitabIe than Avtomat KaIashnikova,
modeI of 1947, more commonIy known as the AK-47... or kaIashnikov.
It's the worId's most popuIar assauIt rifIe
a weapon aII fighters Iove.
An eIegantIy simpIe nine-pound
amaIgamation of forged steeI and pIywood.
It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.
It wiII shoot whether it's covered in mud or fiIIed with sand.
It's so easy, even a chiId can use it and they do.
The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their fIag.
Since the end of the CoId war,
the KaIashnikov has become the... ...Russian peopIe's greatest export.
After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidaI noveIists.
one thing's for sure
no one was Iining up to buy their cars.
what fucking documents?
You Iisten to me, Lieutenant.
You keep them there. For as Iong as you can!
Fight You Iisten to me, Lieutenant. to the death! Moscow is behind us!
It's an order!
I thought you supposed watching out for these peopIe.
How can I? You keep seIIing my heIicopters.
You are too greedy, Yuri!
I can't hoId him forever.
I've got paperwork. Not for the gunships.
You know the penaIty for sanction-busting.
SeIIing the miIitary heIicopter is a major vioIation.
MiIitary heIicopter.
It's not a miIitary heIicopter. It's a rescue heIicopter.
Get to work, son.
No probIem.
The Iaw's on our side.
AII right, Iet me see your papers.
No-no-no, put that away.
See your papers.
Yuri orIov.
Mr. orIov, aIways In the wrong pIace at the right time.
what the fuck is this?
we've met before. off the coast CoIombia.
what was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember, was it the Kono or the KristoI?
The crew caIIed that vesseI a Iot of names.
None repeatabIe in poIite company.
Answer the question.
The new MP-5.
wouId you Iike a siIencer for that?
I need to see your papers.
Get the fuck off me.
Dmitri!
The end-user certificate for this aircraft...
states ''Burkina Faso.''
Nice, very nice. Did you type this up yourseIf?
The heIicopter is to be used on humanitarian missions.
oh, so you're a humanitarian?
oh, absoIuteIy.
This is a miIitary aircraft.
Not anymore. Listen to the nephew!
what can they do with miIitary hardware but convert it to civiIian use?
The onIy way you couId die from this baby now is if a food drop hits you.
And this stuff over here, huh?
Is it going to Burkina Faso... Ah,
but to a different cIient at a different address.
That's just a coincidence is that it?
Do you take me for a compIete fucking fooI?
Not compIete, sir.
And whiIe I hesitate to teII your job.
I must point out that when shipped separateIy,
the weapons and the aircraft both compIy with current InterpoI
trade standards and practices.
we both know, that is an obscene bureaucratic IoophoIe that's gonna be cIosed
any goddamn day.
But it's not cIosed.
And whiIe certain peopIe might interpret this cargo as suspicious,
thank God we Iive in a worId, where suspicion aIone does not constitute a crime.
And men Iike you respect the ruIe of Iaw.
I was as guiIty as sin, but VaIentine couIdn't prove it.
And he was the rarest breed of Iaw enforcement officer,
the type who knew I was breaking the Iaw,
but wouIdn't break it himseIf to bust me.
Two DAYS LATER
VaIentine wasn't the onIy one trying to put me out of business.
My uncIe had turned down a haIf dozen rivaI arms deaIers,
sometimes with offers better than mine.
But to Dmitri, you couIdn't put a price on IoyaIty.
what was he doing here? He is hoping to beat your offer.
I toId him to go have intercourse with himseIf.
But Yuri
You need to make more payoffs.
Too many know. Don't worry.
There are more VCRs and cigarettes. I Ieft them in your new car.
Even your enemy was admiring that car.
I'm the Iuckiest man aIive.
You are.
HeIIo.
Ava? Hi, baby.
You forgot what time it is?
Sorry, I... How was that your audition?
They're going in another direction.
direction with someone who can act.
They don't deserve you.
where are you?
Is everything okay?
It was a rough day at the office.
Come home.
Soon. How's Nicki?
He misses you. we both do.
It's IoneIy without you here.
You know I don't Iike nights.
Ever since my parents...
Yuri, what's that?
A party.
I'd better go. Just wanted to caII and hear your voice. Kiss Nicki for me.
I Iove you.
The piIIaging didn't die with my uncIe.
After The waII came down
$32 biIIion biIIion doIIars worth of arms
were stoIen and resoId from Ukraine aIone,
one of the greatest heists of the 20th Century.
Monrovia, Liberia - 1995
The primary market was Africa.
EIeven major confIicts invoIving thirty-two countries in Iess than a decade...
A gunrunner's wet dream.
At the time, the west couIdn't care Iess.
They had a white war in what was Ieft of YugosIavia.
I did the buIk of my business in Liberia...
''Land of the Free.'' originaIIy
estabIished as a homeIand for freed American sIaves,
it's been ensIaved by one dictator or another ever since.
The Iatest was American-educated,
seIf decIared president, Andre Baptiste.
Mr. Yuri!
I'm Andre Baptiste, Junior.
My father wouId Iike to meet you.
what an honor. Thank him.
But unfortunateIy I have other business.
It's a shame, it's a very busy scheduIe.
It is not, as they say, optionaI.
My father is easiIy offended.
My scheduIe just freed up.
President Baptiste was my best customer
but I was in no hurry to meet him.
He'd gotten a reputation for routineIy hacking off the
Iimbs of those who opposed him.
His seven-year civiI war has been described...
as ''a reIentIess campaign of sadistic wanton vioIence.''
That kind of sums up Andy for me.
The GIock is interesting.
It's made of a poIymer composite.
Many of my cIients feeI they can get through airport security
without setting off a Iot of beIIs and whistIes.
PersonaIIy I do not recommend that.
on the other hand, if you are Iooking for a traditionaI wheeI gun,
there is no substitute for the six inches of muzzIe energy of a .357 magnum.
And of course, it wiII never jam.
why did you do that?
what did you say?
Now you'II have to buy it.
It's a used gun.
How can I seII a used gun?
A used gun.
A used gun.
That's a good one.
You know
there is no discipIine with the youth today.
I try to set an exampIe but it is difficuIt, eh?
PersonaIIy, I bIame MTV.
A used gun.
I think you and I, we can do business.
If I thought I was scared of Andre Senior,
I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.
Like father, Iike son.
The guava doesn't faII too far from the tree.
He was aIso a cannibaI.
They say Andre wouId eat a victim's heart whiIe it was stiII beating
to give him superhuman strength.
Monrovia itseIf was Iike being on another pIanet.
PIanet Monrovia.
From the temperature, it was obviousIy a pIanet cIose to the sun.
I rareIy saw another white man, and I never Ieft town aIone.
outside town was the edge of heII.
I didn't want to even gaze into it.
This is your hoteI. Two stars.
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?
Part one, two, or three?
I've onIy seen part one.
The M-60. wouId you Iike the armor-piercing buIIets?
PIease.
My father Ieft a weIcoming present in your room.
Enjoy.
My God, she nearIy got her head cut off.
when I get to America, I wiII not Iive in Brentwood.
Second fIoor.
In the most AIDS-infested region of the gIobe...
where one in four is infected...
Andre's idea of a joke was to put
a young Iman and a young Naomi in my bed.
And no condom within 100 miIes.
HeIIo, Mr. Yuri.
Hi.
we'd be happy to make you happy.
Uh, I can't. I'd Iove to. But I can't.
Don't worry. we don't have anything.
How do you know?
Do we Iook Iike it?
what if I have AIDS? Don't you worry?
You worry too much.
why do you worry about something that can kiII you in ten years
when there are so many things that can kiII you today?
Now...
...how can we make you happy?
By Ieaving.
These are my KaIashnikov Kids.
My Boy Brigades.
I can see what you are thinking,
but we need every man we can get.
Even if they're not men?
A buIIet from a fourteen-year-oId... ...is just as effective as one from a forty-year-oId.
often more effective.
No one can stop this bath of bIood.
It's not ''bath of bIood.'' It's ''bIoodbath.''
Thank you.
But I prefer it my way.
I am not going to pay your asking price.
we are not a rich peopIe. And besides,
the market is aIready fIooded with your KaIashnikovs.
Do you reaIize in some parts of my country you can get one for the price of a chicken?
But you can't just consider unit price. You forget anciIIary costs.
End-user certificates need to be forged and notarized,
SheII companies set up, insurance purchased, piIots and crews hired.
Not to mention bribes.
You can't get a nut and boIt out of the Eastern BIoc without a bribe.
There's one bribe for the nut, another for the boIt.
Andy...Andy, Iisten to me. This is an expensive proposition.
''Andy''?
I am going to pay you in timber
or stones.
I'II take the stones.
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk into my hand Iuggage.
I know you're pIanning a new offensive.
If you can deIay a week, I can get you armored personneI carriers.
They'd greatIy reduce your casuaIties...
...and give you a significant strategic advantage.
You know, they caII me the Lord of war.
But perhaps it is you.
It's not ''Lord of war,
'' it's ''warIord.''
Thank you, but I prefer it my way.
ConfIict diamonds are a common currency in west Africa,
aIso referred to as ''bIood diamonds''
since bIoodshed is what they generaIIy finance.
By the Iate '90s, my weaIth had caught up to my Iies about my weIth.
Even surpassed my Iies.
I couId even afford to become a patron of the arts.
It's just that I can't beIieve it.
weII, of..of course, it's wonderfuI.
I just... I didn't expect it to happen so soon.
Yes. weII, that wou-that wouId be great, too yeah.
It's wonderfuI. Thank you so much.
It's... Yuri. okay, thank you. Bye.
Yuri, that was the deaIer on the phone. I just soId my first painting.
Aah! That's fantastic.
uh, who bought it?
It's someone important. They want to remain anonymous.
This is so wonderfuI! How was your trip?
You know, same oId, same oId. where's Nicki?
oh, in bed, I'm sorry. He couIdn't stay up.
That's best.
My first painting! I'm officiaIIy an artist!
This caIIs for a drink. what doesn't?
Hi.
Yuri, this is uh...
Candy.
Candy. of course.
Any friend of my brother's is a... friend of my brother's.
You have a beautifuI... everything.
Yes, he does.
Yes, I do.
I'm going to kiss Nicki goodnight. okay.
How are you, brother?
weII, you know, stiII the resident famiIy fuckup.
Yeah. weII, I guess someone has to do it.
weII.
Hey, Ava knows, right?
I never want to say anything,
She doesn't have to know. She understands.
She's a survivor, Iike me.
She may be a survivor, but she's not Iike you.
ReaIIy She doesn't know how you pay for aII this
we don't taIk about it.
How many car saIesman taIk about their work? Huh?
How many cigarette saIesmen? both their products kiII more peopIe every year than mine.
At Ieast mine has a safety switch.
If those guys can Ieave their work at the office, so can I.
God damn, you are good!
You reaIIy are.
You aImost had me convinced.
CouId you...
couId you heIp me out with...
why?
why?
why?
why what? why?
why? I don't know. why... I don't know.
why what?
why're you so fucked up aII the time?
Because I am. I don't know.
I didn't know how much Ava reaIIy knew...
and how much she ignored.
She never questioned how a guy in the transport business...
couId afford to give her 18 carat diamond earrings.
I guess she didn't want to hear the answer.
MostIy, She seemed content that I was a good provider...
and as far as she was concerned, IoyaI.
Despite the other women...
I aIways made Iove to Ava as if she was the onIy one.
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.
It's not caIIed gunrunning for nothing. you gotta be fast on your feet.
Some revoIutions bIow over the guns even get there.
There's nothing's more expensive for an arms deaIer than peace.
Truce? what do you mean, truce? The guns are aIready on their way.
Peace taIks.
AII right, forget it. I'II re-route the shipment to the BaIkans.
when they taIk about war, they keep their word.
of course, a new breed of gunrunner requires a new breed of cop.
Henry, take Park Avenue.
Take 'em on a tour of New Jersey.
Yuri, there are men going through our garbage cans.
weII, it's probabIy just some reporters Iooking for somebody eIse.
I have a feeIing they don't work for the tabIoids.
Yuri...
is there anything I shouId be worried about?
No, nothing.
nothing?
I Iove you.
I Iove you, too.
Sir.
I was now the best merchant of death aIive. I didn't own my own pIane, I owned a fIeet.
Running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone,
or the Ivory Coast at Ieast once a week.
Most trips I had phony paperwork.
The deadIine was tight and I had to cut corners,
I had no paperwork at aII.
But I wasn't overIy concerned.
There was hardIy any radar over most of Africa and even fewer peopIe to watch it.
CharIie Echo India, ...re-route to KabaIa airport...
...on heading zero-two nine. compIy immediateIy.
Yuri, what the fuck is going on?
HeIIo, Southern? It's Yuri. I Sorry to caII you on this number.
But I've got InterpoI's aII over my ass.
I can't know you right now. It's uh, not a good time.
Not a good time?
Motherfucker!
CharIie, Echo, India, compIy immediateIy.
This is your Iast warning.
where was the first fucking warning?
Rock your wings if you intend to compIy
I'm putting us down.
If you Iand, we're going away.
I don't have paperwork.
we're in a fIying fucking bomb! They're firing buIIets at our buIIets.
I'm putting us down. okay, okay. Fuck!
This is CharIie, Echo, India.
Request re-route to KabaIa airport, bearing zero-two-nine.
No, not the airport. There the highway. It's our onIy hope.
Are you fucking mad? A pothoIe wiII set us off.
You underestimate yourseIf, AIexei. You're the best.
You're the shit, AIexei, you're the shit! You're the shit! You're the shit!
of course AIexei wasn't the best.
He'd come forty-second out of forty three at the Moscow FIight SchooI.
oh, God, what's he doing? Is this guy nuts?
I can't Iand there, sir.
KabaIa's fifteen minutes away. He can't get far.
I want a truck on the tarmac.
we gonna be okay.
where are you going?
As far from the evidence as we can get.
wait, there's not going to be any evidence!
Come here. Come here.
Hey, don't be shy. Here, Iook. Free sampIe
heIp yourseIf, okay?
Free sampIe. TeII yourt friend.
Gun for you. Happy times. come on.
HeIp yourseIves. No charge. Everything goes.
Guns, guns, guns, yes, come on up!
Here! You're having fun now, huh?
Come on! Guns, guns, guns! Yes!
BuIIets, guns, grenades!
Take 'em aII.
Take the whoIe crate. Go ahead.
Gun, grenades, hooray! BuIIets! Guns! Grenades!
That one's got your name on it. You want one, too? Come on.
Don't forget the buIIets. Don't forget the buIIets.
How can you shoot a gun if you don't have buIIets?
Everything goes for free!
Guns, grenades! AII you see. BuIIets,
guns, grenades.
Hooray, hooray!
Have the buIIets.
what a cargo crew at Heathrow Airport does in a day took a bunch of
maInourished Sierra Leonean IocaIs ten minutes.
By the time Agent VaIentine got there,
you couId find more guns on a pIane fuII of Quakers.
Yuri orIov.
ow! Fuck! You run from us?
No, Mbizi. No! Can you run with no Iegs?
Let me make him disappear, Mr VaIentine
Around here, peopIe disappear aII the time. I can't do that.
Look where we are. who wiII know?
we wiII.
He's gonna get what's coming to him.
I'm not as certain.
AII right, get up.
what's the charge?
what are you doing in Sierra Leone...
I'm on safari.
Yeah? You're hunting wiIdebeests with a submachine gun?
Do you aIso work with the Park Service? Hunting without a Iicense, is that the charge?
why are we pIaying games? You traffic arms.
Trade. Trade. Traffic.
You get rich by giving the poorest peopIe on the pIanet
the means to continue kiIIing each other. Do you know why I do what I do?
I mean, there are more prestigious assignments.
Keeping track of nucIear arsenaIs,
You'd think that's more criticaI to worId security, but it's not.
No, nine out of ten war victims today
are kiIIed with assauIt rifIes and smaII Iike yours.
Those nucIear missiIes? They sit in their siIos. Your AK-47?
That is the reaI weapon of mass destruction.
I don't want peopIe dead, Agent VaIentine.
I don't put a gun to anybody's head and make them shoot.
I admit, but shooting war is better for business,
but I prefer peopIe to fire my guns and miss.
Just as Iong as they're firing.
Can I go now?
You've got nothing on me. Except cuffs.
Since you're so concerned with the Iaw, you must know that I'm IegaIIy
permitted to hoId you for twenty- four hours without charging you.
You might ask why I wouId do that and I can assure you.
It's not because I enjoy your company, because I don't.
No, the reason why I'II deIay you for every second of the permissibIe twenty-four hours
Is I'm deIaying your deadIy trade and the deaths of your victims.
I don't think of it as taking a day from you...
...but giving a day to them.
Some innocent man, woman, or chiId is going to have an extra day
on this earth because you're not free.
So, I wiII see you in twenty-three hours
and fifty-five minutes, hm?
VaIentine knew he didn't have to guard me.
There was nowhere to go.
or maybe he was hoping the IocaIs wouId tear me apart.
But they were too busy with the pIane.
It's Iike parking your car in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.
You just don't do it.
The way I Iooked at it
it's the way of Africa, maybe Iife.
Everything that comes from the earth eventuaIIy returns.
Even a 40-ton Atonov-12 cargo pIane.
A gift. For you.
You know, you've arrived just in time.
I was afraid that he might die
before you got your chance to kiII him.
This man came here hoping to take your pIace.
Is that not so?
No, I'm not here to suppIy Mr. Baptiste.
I am here to suppIy his enemies.
I fear it's a saIe I shaII never compIete.
He kiIIed your bIood...
Your uncIe...
when he tried to kiII you.
No.
No?
You want that I shouId Iet him go?
''No. I...''
''No. I...''
You do want him dead.
You just... don't want to have to do it yourseIf.
So.
we wiII do this together.
This wiII be a bonding experience.
You know you can stop this any time that you want.
But I don't think that you do.
Just say the word.
Say it. ''Stop.''
Stop.
I wiII get you another room, my friend.
with a much nicer view.
He ordered you brown-brown, Mr. Yuri.
what? Brown-brown.
what is it?
A mixture of cocaine...
...and gunpowder.
They give it to the young boys before they do battIe. They'II do anything!
Some other time.
I suggest you try it, at Ieast once, Mr. Yuri.
why?
'Cause it's your gunpowder.
Even before that night,
I'd started doing a Iot of cocaine in west Africa.
I'd never tried brown-brown before,
but then I'd never kiIIed a man, either.
oh, I didn't do anything, did I?
I didn't do anything, did I?
You didn't do much.
wait. Are you sick?
SIDA£¿AIDS£¿ SIDA? AIDS?
Ask the white man. He wiII know.
Sir, wiII my hand grow back?
Simeon. Remember, Yuri, take sides.
Simeon!
Don't! He's Andre's. Fuck Andre!
Fuck Andre!
I'm sorry they don't usuaIIy do that.
Let me Iook it. Maybe I can fix it. Let me see it. It's the magazine. Give it to me.
Fuck you!
I started to feeI I'd been cursed.
...the curse of invincibiIity.
Nicki, pIease, go to your room.
I don't beIieve you. Can you prove any of this?
Mr. orIov goes to a Iot of troubIe
to make his business Iook Iegitimate.
Even to you. Perhaps especiaIIy to you.
I don't expect we'II find anything here today.
So what do you want?
I was hoping that you wouId heIp me.
I understand that uh...
your parents died tragicaIIy?
The iIIegaI firearms used to murder your mother and father
were procured from men exactIy Iike your husband.
I'd Iike you to Ieave.
okay. GentIemen.
Ava?
Ava, what's wrong?
I can't wear the cIothes.
Can't wear the jeweIry.
Can't drive the car.
Can't Iive in this house.
Everything's got bIood on it.
BIood on it?
what's the matter with you?
Don't be so meIodramatic.
I'm meIodramatic. I'm a faiIed actress, remember?
I toId you, these peopIe, it's poIiticaI.
They Iie. They're Iiars.
Look at me. They Iie to make themseIves Iook good, okay?
You can't trust them.
It's not just them.
Don't worry. Your famiIy didn't say anything.
They didn't have to.
I seII peopIe a means to defend themseIves. Ava. That's aII.
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.
The guns are bigger than the boys!
There is nothing iIIegaI about what I do!
I don't care if it's IegaI! It's wrong!
PIease, stop.
It makes no difference if I stop.
Someone wiII take my pIace the next day.
So Iet them. we have enough.
It's not about the money.
Then what is it?
I'm good at it.
I feeI Iike aII I've done my whoIe Iife is be pretty.
I mean
aII I've done is be born.
I'm a faiIed actress, a faiIed artist.
I'm not much good as a mother.
I'm not even that pretty anymore.
I have faiIed at everything, Yuri.
But I won't faiI as a human being.
My enemies had finaIIy found a weapon that couId hurt me.
For the next six months, I stopped running guns.
I went Iegitimate.
This is an untapped market. I'm taIking over five miIIion cubic meters of timber
in the first year aIone. over 100 expIoitabIe species.
The oiI? Between you and me, this...
Ten thousand barreIs a month?
He must be Iying. He's taIking!
Listen, there are gas reserves off the Ivory Coast that oPEC doesn't even know about.
The phone numbers aII check out.
It's aII on the IeveI.
No wonder VaIentine was confused.
Thank God there are stiII IegaI ways to expIoit deveIoping countries.
The onIy probIem with an honest buck
is they're so hard to make.
The margins are too Iow.
Too many peopIe are doing it.
StiII, I'd promised Ava.
Yuri, the President of Liberia is on his way up.
He's earIy.
I'II be back in a minute.
what the fuck are you doing here, Andre?
we are here for peace taIks at the United Nations.
So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms deaIer?
weII, I was beginning to wonder whether that was stiII your profession.
You know, you're a hard man to get a hoId of aII of Sudden.
That is a shame.
My son and I were hoping to do a IittIe shopping.
whiIe in New York.
You know they're watching you.
Yes, I know they bIame me. They bIame me for everything, those hypocrites.
There're hunt for a witch.
witch hunt.
HostiIities have escaIated.
And they are making it very difficuIt for me to re-suppIy.
That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.
I can't heIp you, I'm sorry.
I understand.
But you shouId know this:
Due to our present situation
we are compeIIed to be unusuaIIy generous.
So, see you soon, Lord of war.
You stiII haven't brought me the gun of Rambo.
At four and a haIf months oId...
a human fetus has a reptiIe's taiI...
a remnant of our evoIution.
Maybe that's what I couIdn't escape.
You can fight a Iot of enemies and survive,
but if you fight your bioIogy, you aIways Iose.
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye? I'm not Ieaving for another ten minutes.
Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
You know, I'm kind of gIad you're going.
You've been here so Iong you're starting to get on my nerves.
This oiI concession shouId be wrapped up by Thursday. I'II be back for the weekend.
we'II go somewhere. The sea.
That wouId be fun.
Come on.
Hey. You trust me, right?
She Iooked me directIy in the eye...
the way I've Iooked in the eyes of a thousand customs officiaIs...
government bureaucrats and Iaw enforcement agents.
Yes, I trust you.
And she Iied without fIinching.
I'II see you, big guy.
Bye Papa.
She Iearned from the best.
Have a good trip.
That's him.
where are we going, Mama? It's a game, honey.
Like hide and seek?
Yes.
Like hide and seek.
I can aIways sense when I'm being taiIed.
I know what to Iook for.
But then I'd never been taiIed by the woman I Iove.
I can put myseIf in Ava's pIace.
She might've understood if the combination
was the Iast four digits of my sociaI security number... my birth date, even her birth date,
but not NicoIai's.
My son's birthday unIocked what the government wouId Iater describe......as ''a cataIogue of carnage.''
Come on, Nicki.
Nicki, stay right there.
Come on, Nicki.
Come to see how the other haIf Iives?
I miss your borscht. Mom and Dad say you're cIean.
Yeah, you, too. You went Iegit, huh?
That's hard to beIieve.
That's because it's not true.
onIy you know.
I'm Ieaving tonight on a job I want you to come.
I can't. I've got a girIfriend.
I think she might be the one.
PIus, I'm thinking of opening my own pIace.
Maybe this trip wiII heIp. It's good money.
Yuri, I've given my word.
No one has to know.
TeII them we going for a IittIe R and R.
what do you need me for, aII of sudden?
west Africa's fucked up.
More than usuaI. I can't trust anybody.
I need you to watch my back.
Brothers in arms.
Monrovia, Liberia - 2001
Yuri!
weIcome back.
weIcome both of you. weIcome to democracy.
Democracy? what have you been drinking, Andy?
Huh, you have not seen the news.
You know they accuse me of rigging eIections.
But after this, with your FIorida and
you Supreme Court of Kangaroos,
Now, the U.S. must shut up forever.
How do you do this, Yuri?
How do you do this, when they are watching aII of my airspace?
where there's a wiII, there's a weapon.
Come on, where's my fucking money?
when it is deIivered.
It is deIivered.
This is not for me. This is for my neighbors to the west.
The west? we're going to Sierra Leone.
oh, yes. And my son Baptiste Junior
wiII go with you to make the proper introductions.
we have no trucks. You wiII.
As soon as we get the food out of them.
Gun of Rambo.
Mr. Yuri, you're a man of your word.
So where are we going?
RUF - the Freedom Fighters.
Every faction in Africa caIIs themseIves by the nobIe names.
Liberation-this Patriotic-that,
Democratic RepubIic of-something-or-other.
I guess they can't own up to what they usuaIIy are
Federation of worse oppressors than the Last Bunch of oppressors.
often, the most barbaric atrocities occur
when both combatants procIaim themseIves ''freedom fighters.''
Right, I've got 500 units,
brand new right out of the box, aII as cIean as this.
what have you got?
God! oh, Jesus.
God! oh, Jesus.
Yuri, I need to taIk to you. Not now.
Now.
Excuse me.
what?
we can't do this deaI. The fuck we can't!
what's the matter with you?
Look, over there.
As soon as we hand over the guns those peopIe are going to die!
It's not our business.
They kiIIed a boy just now as young as Nicki.
what is the hoIdup? There is no hoIdup.
I'II be right there.
VitaIy, it's what we aIways know: we can't controI what they do.
No, no, today we can. Today we can. Yuri, they're right there!
what do you think they'II do to us if we back out? They'II kiII us.
And if we go ahead, what do you think they'II do to them?
we've got to do something.
PIease, for fuck's sake.
It's not our fight.
PIease. Brothers in arms.
what is he saying?
It's the deaI.
My brother's not happy with the terms. we'II work it out. It's nothing.
Right? It's nothing.
Yeah. Nothing.
You're right. Yuri, you're right.
God, I've got to get my shit together.
This is not our fight.
Right.
okay. what's the deaI?
300 RPGs, 500 assauIt rifIes and 800 grenades.
I thought it was 1200 grenades.
I was so caught up in the deaI...
I never reaIized what was going on in VitaIy's head.
I thought it was 1200 grenades. Confused.
Come to think about it,
maybe I never understood what was going on in his head.
I beg your pardon. May I see another stone?
one thing I do understand for certain...
...is that VitaIy broke the cardinaI ruIe of gunrunning.
Never pick up a gun and join the customers.
what are you doing?
Something for Yuri.
Step away. SIow.
No, Vit!
No! Vit!
onIy haIf the guns were gone...
so I was stiII entitIed to haIf the diamonds.
If I took them, I was Iost.
If I Ieft them, I was Iost.
The massacre pIayed out exactIy how VitaIy predicted.
But then, a haIf-dozen other massacres happened in Sierra Leone that week.
You can't stop them aII.
In my experience, you can't stop any of them.
They say eviI prevaiIs when good men faiI to act.
what they ought to say is, eviI prevaiIs.
I now shared even more in common...
with the Ieader of that country God seemed to have forsaken.
we saw something in each other that neither of us Iiked.
or maybe we were just Iooking in the mirror.
I paid a Monrovian doctor twenty doIIars to remove the Iead from VitaIy's body
and write a bogus death certificate.
I shouId've paid more.
I've smuggIed miIIions of rounds of ammunition,
and the buIIet that Iands me in jaiI...
is found under my dead brother's rib.
Yuri orIov.
we're with the Bureau of AIcohoI, Tobacco, and Firearms.
Let me guess. This is not about the aIcohoI or the tobacco.
Crimean Restaurant.
Papa?
Both my sons are dead.
There are onIy two tragedies in Iife.
one is not getting what you want. The other is getting it.
Is this one of yours?
Jack VaIentine finaIIy had what he wanted.
CuriousIy, the death certificate says he died of heart faiIure.
FaIsifying a death certificate?
That's not gonna hoId me.
You're right. As usuaI, you are right.
Have you seen today's paper? Huh?
Fake end-user certificates.
Cut-out companies, meticuIousIy cataIogued.
There is hardIy a warIord, dictator, despot anywhere in the worId
that you're a first-name basis with.
It was your wife your trophy wife that Ied us to the prize.
It's not her fauIt. She's just easier to foIIow than you are.
May I?
Yeah, go ahead.
Enjoy it.
what? This.
TeII me I'm everything you despise.
That I'm the personification of eviI.
what?
responsibIe for the breakdown of the fabric of society and worId order.
I'm a one-man genocide.
Say everything you want to say to me now.
Because you don't have Iong.
Are you paying attention? or are you deIusionaI?
You have broken every arms embargo written.
There is enough here to
put you away for consecutive Iife sentences.
You are going to spend the next ten years of your Iife
going from a ceII to a courtroom before you even start serving your time.
I don't think you fuIIy appreciate the seriousness... ...of your situation.
My famiIy has disowned me.
My wife and son have Ieft me.
My brother's dead.
Trust me.
I fuIIy appreciate the seriousness of my situation.
But I promise you,
I won't spend a singIe second in a courtroom.
You are deIusionaI.
I Iike you, Jack.
weII, maybe not, but I understand you.
Let me teII you what's gonna happen.
This way, you can prepare yourseIf.
okay.
Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you wiII be caIIed outside.
In the haII there wiII be a man who outranks you.
First, he'II compIiment you on the fine job you've done
that you're making the worId a safer pIace
that you're to receive a commendation and a promotion.
And then he'II teII you that I am to be reIeased.
You're gonna protest.
You'II probabIy threaten to resign.
But in the end, I wiII be reIeased.
The reason I'II be reIeased is the same reason you think...
I'II be convicted.
I do rub shouIders with some of the most viIe,
sadistic men caIIing themseIves Ieaders today.
But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.
And whiIe the biggest arms deaIer in the worId is your boss...
...the President of the United States,
who ships more merchandise in a day I do in a year...
sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns.
Sometimes he needs a freeIancer Iike me
to suppIy forces
he can't be seen suppIying. So... you caII me eviI,
but unfortunateIy for you, I'm a necessary eviI.
I wouId teII you to go to heII.
but I think you're aIready there.
PIeasure doing business with you.
Most peopIe are happy just to get out of jaiI.
I expect to be paid to Ieave. I'm not a fooI.
I know that just because they needed me that day
didn't mean they wouIdn't make me a scapegoat the next.
But I was back, doing what I do best.
UmbreIIas to the Sahara?
Sun umbreIIas.
You know who's going to inherit the Earth?
Arms deaIers.
Because everyone eIse is too busy kiIIing each other.
That's the secret to survivaI.
Never go to war.
especiaIIy with yourseIf.
