.
I always wanted to be a Rock Star.
One who made an impact.
Even though... Brian Jones died at 27.
Elvis at 42, and John Lennon didn't live very long, either.
I live in a country that is still very young -
I live in the GDR - and otherwise, I don't have any problems.
Right now, I'm making a copy of a forbidden song.
There's no official reason it's banned, but everybody knows it is anyway.
Image a government office where they spend the whole day...
listening to the new hot records, just so they can ban them.
And they like banning them, and they ban a lot.
My name's Michael Ehrenreich
and I'm 17.
Behind this wall there's another.
The Wall that divides Berlin - East and West.
The Golden West is just a stone's throw away.
I live on a street with its longer part in the West
and its shorter part in the East.
SUN AVENUE
The West Berliners built observation platforms so they could make fun of us.
Look, folks!  An Eastie!
He's so sweet that you could fall in love with him.
Hey, Eastie.  Wave! Wave!  Want a Mars bar?  I'll toss one down.
Don't feed the animals!
- Where did you get those awesome clothes from?
- We're all doing fine.  How about you?
It wasn't that bad but I didn't want to talk about it.
Besides, it was absolutely forbidden to talk to them.
We had no homeless people in our country, and no one went hungry either.
Groceries were inexpensive and prices stable.
That's Mario.
- Get your hands off it.
- Here's the money.
Mario's my friend
and lives on Sun Avenue, too.
We're together almost every day and have a lot of fun,
but today we were talking about only one thing.
Have you already decided what you're going to tell them?
Not yet.
I'm going to say "No" for sure.
- Hey, red light.
- So what?
Hi, Micha,
Hi, Jutta.
- Maybe one day we'll be standing there, too.
- If you say "Yes" then I bet you're right.
Guys, The Stones are amazing.
I've just heard a track from their new album,
Exile on Main Street.
- Are you saying "Yes" tomorrow?
- Take a look.
Real Jeans from C&A.
Braggart,
Hi,
Let me tell you something about my new girl friend.
Give us a break.
I asked you if we were going to say "Yes" to three years in the Army, or not!
It's relatively simple for me.
I'm going to study and I think you're going too.
Sure - high school diploma and then college.
But if we don't say "Yes" it will all be more difficult.
Oh, you're such a pain.  Can't you just drop it?
Just yesterday we wanted to organize a resistance group,
and now you're going into the Army for three years?
Are you nuts?
This is my father.
Careful, Sabine.
I can see everything.
My mom,
"Careful" is her favorite word.
And that's my sister.  She's attracted to all men and gets a new boyfriend every week.
This one is in a political party.
Who changed it to the East German channel?
Time to set up the adjustable table.
- What?
- You were supposed to change the
way the Multi-Function table is set up.
But be careful,
Turn the crank,
East German shit,
Too high.
That's because it was produced in the East,
- Don't talk like that. Georg doesn't like it.
- So let him go see his friends in the party.
Moscow, Moscow,
That's forbidden, isn't it?,
Moscow, Moscow,
That's forbidden for sure,
Push the "play" button, you punk, not "record"!
That's what I did.
I have a question.
Why is it forbidden?
Don't you have a clue at all?
Because of the lyrics. It's obvious.
I knew that.
Put the player here, please,
- You didn't understand it the right way, Mr. Sergeant.
- Sergeant Major.
Being forbidden means something totally different in young people's language.
That's one of our favorite ways to say...
- That something is cool...
- Indeed.
- What is this song about?
- We can't understand it.
- The only language we learn at school is Russian.
- Thank God.
Maybe I'll study in Moscow someday.
- That's why we're listening to this song.
- How do you turn this thing off?
That's her, Miriam.
Coming right out from a fairy-tale, wonderful, adorable,
unattainable Miriam.
And... I love her.
I'm confiscating this.
Even I have fun.  I'll make a copy.
Great song.
I collect records, too.
I don't look like I would, do I?
Sometimes I play songs for my comrades
We really have a good time, especially with the banned songs.
You punk.
You may go.
Hesitating?
Not me!
We're hungry.
.
.
Herbert, look,
German Democratic Republic border, passport control.
I've lost my passport.
Our relatives from the West.
That's my uncle Heinz, who crosses the border several times a week.
He's a smuggler, continuously improving his methods.
Show me your suitcase, please.
But my uncle does not smuggle forbidden magazines, records or pornography.
What he smuggles is actually absolutely legal.
What do we have here?
I'm sorry, I forgot to take it out.
The West won't last much longer if they have to eat these.
Are you a member of a fascist party? Yes.
No!
- Did that hurt?
- I'm going to throw you out, you...
Fold the table up!  Otherwise
it takes up the whole room.
I'm coming.
Come in, Heinz.
We've had a small accident.
Did you bring everything?
Come in, you communist-hunter.
That's our local cop.
Meet my daughter and her friend.
He's a member of the party.
Is that your future son-in-law?
Surely, you don't have much time...  Or would you like to sit down?
Is that a Multi-Function table?
Has Micha gotten in trouble, Sergeant?
What?
Sergeant Major.
Next week I'm going to be promoted to Sub-Lieutenant - that's an officer rank.
But today you're still a Sergeant Major,
Sergeant Major?
That's a non-com rank, and a Sub-Lieutenant is an officer rank.
Next there are general ranks: Lieutenant General, Major General...
- It's different in the Navy.
- ...Colonel General...
- Seaman, lance-seaman...
- ...and then Army-General.
...boatswain, lance-boatswain,
frigate captain, corvette captain, seafaring captain...
then you have the rear-admiral, vice-admiral...
- ...and admiral.
- Stop babbling.
That's the way it is.
I've got to go. There's a lot to be done.
I'll see you out.
Has Micha really not caused any trouble?
Yes, I mean: No.
But I came here officially.
One of the West German citizens lost her
passport near here.
- I'd like to kindly ask any finder...
- Of course.
If I find it I'll turn it in right away,
Mr...
- Sergeant Major.
...Horkefeld.
Good bye...
Always lock the door tight, please.
68 years old...
Excuse me, does Miriam Sommer
live in this house?
Do you live here?
Sure I do.
Do you happen to know Miriam Sommer?
That's my sister.
What do you want from her?
Your sister.
I'll pay you for a piece of information.
- The "Schachtel Club" single.
- Where would I get that right now?
Then you're really out of luck, dude.
- You must be Uncle Heinz.
- I know, Sabine's new boyfriend.
At last.  We've been waiting a long time.  Did they frisk you?
You old communist hunter.
You're doing a striptease?
For the lady of the house.
Don't you think they're too big for me?
Your size doesn't fit me.
Maybe they'll shrink after boiling.
- Don't you have anything for me?
- Not this time.
- Nothing for me either.
- Blasted table, I'll make a complaint.
This place is filled with asbestos -
you're going to get lung cancer.
Over where you live, maybe.
It's just a matter of time,
Just wait ten years and...
- Ten years?
- Yes.
We've lived here for ten years.
We've got to make a complaint, then.
Micha, I've got something for you.
I smuggled it.
Underwear! Great!
Come, sit down, son.  We're happy for you, too.
You probably had to hide those deep in your bag.
No problem at all,
What are you doing over there?
An application for party admittance?
Which party do you want to join?
You only have one here, right?
My daughter in the party?
That won't happen.  Never!
- Is she supposed to make nothing of her life?
- Georg is in the party as well.
Did I not accomplish anything?
The Anniversary of the Communist Manifesto is not a festival.
Of course.  I know that.
Why?
Leave her alone and think about how you're going to say "Yes" tomorrow at school.
- I'm not going into the Army for three years.
- So, you don't want to study in Moscow?
Oh, he wants to study in Moscow.  Good for him.
With your grades, though?
Study in Russia?
The boy should either study in Oxford
or at the Sorbonne.
Only mental cripples go to Russian schools.
Do you know what you are, Heinz?
You're nothing but a troublemaker.
What would become of all of you if I'm
not here any more.
Where would you want to go?
I don't know,
Where does she want to go?
Nobody can get out of here.
Who can't leave? We go everywhere. Thuringia, everywhere.  To the moon.  We were the first to the Moon.
- Leica.
- Camera?
- The Dog.
- The Dog, dammit.
- And you're from a crappy foreign country.
- Foreign country?  I'm from Germany.
I've already explained that to you.
- All of us are Germans.
- I disagree.
Germans like this and like that,
but only Germans.
Do you want to serve in the People's Army
for three years?
Of course you do, Micha?
In moments like this, you're frighteningly alone.
Yes.
So now, tell me, all over the world, where is life really bad for children?
In America, France, Scandinavia...
We've got to learn how to impress the girls.
Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's learn from an expert.
Wuschel is going to teach us.
Give me a break.
I'm too young.
Excuse me, young lady...
Can you tell us...
Let me show you.
There's a disco in our school and with the help of my friends...
Where's number one Sun Avenue?
Actually I don't really know
but number seventeen is there so...
I won't let you make fun of me.
With the help of my friends we wanted...
You want to impress her and you don't have the slightest idea what to say?
- What did you say to her?
- What is there to say?
She's not going to the disco?
She doesn't have the time.
Here's the last chance,
- Michael, your turn.
- Why don't we do it later?
Not those witches from our again...
Make me feel better,
- What disgusting music.
- Can I bring my own records?
Today you have to make it clear to her.
Your glasses.
Wanna dance?
Excuse me?
Do you want to dance?
Can't you see I'm smoking right now?
Well, at least he tried.
If that jerk played "The Stones", surely then it would have worked.
Whose red Ford Taunus is out there with the license plate number RE S538?
Mine.
Follow me, please,
Are you coming or not?
Who let the class enemy into the school?
Leave this place, please!
Oh, there's a lot happening here in the East.
See you all next time.
- It was Miriam.
- I see that myself.
- Please.
- Ciao, Bella.
At the next FDJ meeting you will give a self-critical lecture.
Miriam and a guy from the West.
A kiss does not mean anything.
I'm getting dizzy.
I've got to think of something.
My little ones collected recyclable materials worth 130 Marks.
My older ones got more than 200.
Then we've already reached the required contribution!
I painted another sunflower for Angela Davis,
We're so proud of you.
Think of how many sunflowers were collected in the whole country.
- We'll free the young friends of Angela Davis for sure.
- The Americans are shuddering!
I used to have one like that, too.
THE PARTY IS THE PROTECTOR OF THE WORKING CLASS
Watch out, she's coming.
Friendship!
What is the big uproar here?
We are not in West Germany.
Sit down.
Alright.  Our topic for today is...
Thank you, Franziska.
THE PARTY IS THE FORESKIN OF THE WORKING CLASS
Who did this?  Franziska?
- I believe it was Mario.
- So.  Of course.
It's so sad to see you behave like a class enemy
and to see that you have absolutely no respect for the accomplishments of our nation
which - under the guidance of the labor class...
Yes, Micha... what
do you think about it?
I just want to say... I did it.
You?
I'm so disappointed.
Micha should be punished as well, don't you think, friends?
I could give a self-critical lecture at the next FDJ meeting.
That sounds like a proper punishment
although it's actually an honor.
Mario, you've been rehabilitated.
My Camille.  Where shall I search for you now?
I'm practicing my FDJ presentation, all for Miriam.
That's Sabine's new boyfriend.
He's with the theatre.
Be serious. You're going to play Lucile at acting school.
Acting isn't a joke.
You have to be serious about it.
You have to be severely sick to have a telephone installed.
Make a complaint.
- You need to have to much sugar.
- I can get some sugar.
- He meant people suffering from diabetes.
- I can't smuggle that.
Dear FDJ members...
leading role and meaning of a labor party...
...or have a paralyzed child, like the Meisners.
Your neighbor works in the State Security Service and also has a phone.
- How come you know where he works?
- Because he has a phone.
- Then why doesn't he hang out the flag?
- Because he works in the Stasi.
But you do hang out the flag.
I'm trying to explain to you that he works in the Stasi.
What can we do about it?
- Do you have to hang out the flag?
- That's what I was talking about.
Party... labor class...
Could you please stop for a while?
You have to act like Saint-Just, another character in "Danton's Death".
Show everyone how you feel deep inside.
Or like Brutus:
Friends, Romans, Countrymen!
We don't have the right acoustics here, but...
Dear FDJ members...
- What's going on here?
- What are you asking?
- Why do you look like that?
- Yeah.
And just what do you look like?
It's just an attempt,
If I were you I would be happy to see her at that age.
You've got asbestos here everywhere.
Enough about the Revolution.
Now for something personal.
Even a young woman in the FDJ has to have someone to be proud of.
I'm sure that if I had boyfriend -
though I don't have one at the moment -
and he went into the Army for three years, then I would be true to him.
That I solemnly promise.
We'd like to thank our friend, Miriam Sommer, for her self-critical lecture.
Do you have any questions?
I attacked Lenin...
.. and the party and the labor class.
I did it in public, and of course, that gets you...
really into trouble.
Today we have a guest from Socialist People's Republic of Vietnam, Ling Weng,
with a presentation about the American aggressor.
Good day, pioneer friends and comrades...
I do not speak in German, all in Vietnamese...
Thank you much.  Thank you much.
Let's thank Ling Weng for her speech,
and let's listen to Michael Ehrenreich.
Dear FDJ members,
The unified role of the meaning of the writings of the theorists, the working class...
... the party... is today more important than ever...
Especially Marx, Engels, and Lenin.  Love...
You're acting as though she had undressed for you.
You're going to get attached to this woman and then become part of the system.
What made you believe that she doesn't have a boyfriend?
She said, "If I had had a boyfriend, but I don't have one..." don't you understand?
- There's no longer any way to rescue you.
- Hey!
- Give me a kiss.
- Better not.
- Just a good-bye kiss.
- No.
Why are you so happy?
Just take a look what he is wearing.
I'm going into the Army for three years and I'll come to the border and blast you all to pieces!
Now, an orderly retreat.  Katie first, and then in two lines.
Your identity card.
Not him again.
Something must have happened... but what?
I'm watching you, Ehrenreich.  One more thing and you're done for.
And now for the latest hit
from your own Sergeant-Major Horkefeld.
Strictly prohibited.
- Have a good day, Sergeant Major.
- Sergeant!
You can buy everything that is forbidden on the black market.
In a moment we'll have it.  That guy.
He looks dangerous.
That's a dealer.  He deals in records.
I need something psychedelic.
"Tangerine Dream".
For my exhibition.
Bravo,
- Is there also one with Alice Cooper?
- 20 DM each.
20 DM?
- Do you have porn magazines?
- No.  They're over there.
Let's go.
- Wuschel, your time has come.
- I'm nervous.
C'mon.  Eyes on the prize.
- And?
- Some other time.
Nothing going on with you guys.  OK, bye.
Hesse vs. Sartre.
- Oh, maybe I was wrong about you.
- Wait a moment.
- Saturday Night Fever?
- I don't carry disco music.
Kate Bush?
- The Wow-Album?
- Right.
Terrible wailing.
Get lost. Next.
An original, sealed "Exile on Main Street".
Logo, sealed, excellent condition.
Why would I sell anything less?
Have you ever read Sartre?
You bet, he's great.
We could discuss that.
I'll leave you two alone.
Here you go.
I've been waiting for this moment my whole life.
Sealed in the original wrapper!
- How much?
- 250 of your money.
I'd have to work three months for that.
The Stones spent two months in the studio.
Go listen to Zappa.
Without Brian Jones the Stones would be totally forgotten.
He had the beautiful album, but how will I get the money.
C'mon guy.  Soon you'll have it.
Where's Mario?
- For instance let's take Hesse,,,
- Hesse is madness.
- Hesse is metaphysical, esoteric...
- Exactly.
For example "Steppenwolf",
Steppenwolf is good.
"Born to be wild".
That's a song, and that "Steppenwolf" is a rock band.
You will never be free unless you free the others.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
What Jean meant?
Who?
Jean Paul.
- Who?
- Sartre.
You will never be free...
until you free the others.
Now do you get it?
So, already excited about the next one you get to shoot, you dogs?
That's our neighbor from the State Security Service.
- Good evening, do I disturb you?
- No.
- I wanted to ask you about something.
- Good evening, Mr. Fromm.
- What do you actually do for a living?
- We should talk about that in detail some time.
I'm asking you because you have such a flexible work schedule.
Micha, come home,
Don't disturb Mr. Fromm.
- Your son is very curious.
- Do some preparation for your studies in Moscow.
(The wall must go down.)
That's my incorrigible relative from the West.
Could you lend me two blankets for our guests coming to the youth festival?
- I'll see what I can do.
- We're hosting a few people.
We have to support the FDJ.
Now wasn't that clever?
Think what a good report he'll write about us to his commanding officer.
What are you up to?
Are you crazy?  What's with this whistling?
- Yeah, the world is round.
- Cut it out.
I don't want to be buried here.
With you everything is always at its worst.
What is actually going on in here?
You're no longer wearing your glasses...
And who's that?  We haven't been introduced.
- That's Uwe, my fiance.
- Your fiance?
Good day.  I'm Uwe.
He's a catholic and he comes from the seminary.
A catholic.  And I wanted to be a grandmother.
I don't want any more of this.
I can't take it any more.
Now we have something nice...
It's for Doris.
A phone.
We're even already in the phone book.
Thank God.
God had nothing to do with this.
It was a doctor.
I got a testimonial that I'm seriously ill.
He suffers epileptic attacks.
There is some truth in this.
Shut up.
Who knows our number?
It's in the phone book,
the big fat one.
And now?
We've got to pick up the phone.
But be careful, careful.
This is how you do it.
Hello.  Heinz here, at the home of Otte and Doris Ehrenreich.
Micha, it's for you.
- Miriam?
- Micha!
- I didn't think you were capable of this!
- Don't make him nervous!
- Ask him whether she can hear you clearly.
- From a phone book?
- He's got a girlfriend.
- What's her voice like?
- Dad, stop it.
- Can she hear you well?
I'll call back in a sec,
Bring her here!
- The best form of attack is defense.
- Ask her whether she could hear you clearly.
And don't be an idiot.
Damn,
Eastern shit.
Not in the border neighborhood.
- A spy?
- Fugitive.
Cheers.
Just you wait.
One more time.
It's going to begin soon.
Miriam... I couldn't talk.
I'm in the phone booth right under your window.
- Come upstairs.
- What?
- I said, you can come upstairs.
I'm coming.
Your identity card.
Wait, I'll go get it.
An identity card is your most important document.  You must always carry it.
In the border neighborhood, if you are found without it,
you will be brought to the station for identification.
- Arrest him.
- He should be shot.
I've warned you, Citizen Ehrenreich.
Wow.  That was...  really....  like an artistic experience.
Mario... are you free now?
Tell me.  Sartre and making people free.  Do you think this was what he had in mind?
Sure, he's a Frenchman.
That's a good point.
It's all running into my boots.
So after ten hours my mother finally came for me.
For me you're a hero.
Oh, spare the words.
I thought about Miriam the whole time and that made it easier for me.
Women.  What a puzzle.
I think about her all day long.  It's new and so omnipresent.
Just like with that Stones' album.
It's hard to know what others are feeling.
This is Sabrina.
- So, Sabrina and I, we're sort of, a kind of...
- Mario and I are together now.
- So you are now making Mario part of the system, right?
- What?
That was something between him and me.  This is something completely different.
- Do you want to get married or something?
- Get married?  What are you talking about?
My parents are going out tomorrow and I'd like to throw a party.
Underground style.  I'll show you some stuff with drugs.
Drugs? Where are you going to get them?
In a drug store, of course!
I've got to go.
Is your sister home?
She was waiting for you yesterday.
It was a political matter. I'd like to invite her to a party, here's the address.
These are asthmatic's herbs but we make drugs out of them.
I've got a question.
What's in it?
Datura, horsetail and deadly nightshade.
We put everything into a glass...
We want to see Sabrina.
Damn her, she's got a real house.
And now we add some cola.
This is Birgit.
We're lesbian.
You've got a problem?
- Did you bring some records?
- I'm not working tonight.
- Does it taste good?
- That's not the point.
That's right.
Careful, these are antique instruments.
If something happens to them, my father is going to be really pissed off.
Is Miriam here?
No, but go to the kitchen.
Sabrina is showing us something with drugs.
Brats.
Even here we can't avoid their cigarettes.
Can't you smoke on the balcony?  There's no smoking here.  My father, if it smells here...
- Hey, this is for your mom.
- What?
- Aren't your parents home?
- If they were we would not be having a party.
- I need a room for my happening.
- What?
- This one is ideal.
- Are you Sabrina's friend too?
And now we'll drink all of it.  That's really important.
Cheers.
What's the problem?
I don't know if I should...
Miriam's coming soon.
Good.  Maybe this will loosen you up.
It's really nice in here.
- Did you like that blonde?
- I didn't say anything about her.
I saw the look in your eyes.
Can you feel anything?
No... you?
Nothing.
I'm going out on the balcony to look and see where Miriam is.
I was looking for you.
There's got to be a bath somewhere here.
Damn, a spot came out on my face,,,
and Miriam has not come yet.
Can you feel anything?
No.
I'll check from the balcony to see if Miriam's coming.
Do you think she's still coming?
It's time for a protest.
Urine knows nothing about borders.
Miriam is coming!
She's coming.
What am I going to do about that blasted spot?
I've got to do something.
And now...  I have to...  rise...  to the heavens!
I can see double.
Everybody's gone mad.
It's superb.
Hi, Micha.
Go and make her your squaw.
My work of art!
I had a little equilibrium problem but it's ok now.
I'm fed up with superficiality.
I understand that you're annoyed by this repeated crap.
I understand you.
We're spiritually connected to each other!
I feel exactly the same way you do.
I wrote all my thoughts down in countless diaries over the years.
And now you come to me, and you think like me.
- Now those... I'd love to read THEM sometime.
- What?
Those countless diaries.
Sometimes everything happens all at once.
- And now we have to go to the headmistress.
- Let me talk.
Sure.
After all, I have a stipend.
- I wouldn't utter a word anyway.
- Just let me do the talking.
I don't feel well,
A visit from the State Security Service.
On of my unpleasant duties is reading the enemy's newspapers. Every day.
There must be worse things.
You will never be free unless you free the others.  Sartre said that.
An existentialist!
But Mario's toilet was clogged. We had to go somewhere, didn't we?  That's natural.
Besides, the enemy's papers are full of lies.  You said yourself you have to read them every day.
That can't be us.
OK, if we've done something wrong, then we ask very much for forgiveness.
Right? Can't you see?
even though we're not quite innocent...
You urinated on the antifascist protection wall.  You urinated on our country.
Ernst Th‰lmann and thousands of his comrades were executed for our country.
And you urinated on their graves!
On the graves of those...
thanks to whom you are given a free education
and live in peace and prosperity.
You, Mario Naujoks, you are no longer a student at this school.
Get out of my sight.
And you, Mr. Ehrenreich, your stipend is cancelled.
Now, leave.
For Mario, the best time of his life began.
Together with Sabrina he learned what freedom is.
They were always on the road.
The countryside seemed gigantic to them.
Maybe because their moped was so slow.
Hi, Micha,
You were going to let me read your diaries...
Well, first I have to find them all,
especially the early years.
I'll wait.
- Are you sick?
- Give me a break, I've got lots to do.
Need a hand?
I don't want to be disturbed.
- Good day, I'm Olaf from Dresden.
- I'm Udo.
Papa, our lodgers are here.
Hello! I'm Olaf from Dresden.  I've come to the festival in the capital.
- That's our tenant.
- We're all from the same club.
He's quite pale.
So close to the border?  That is certainly dangerous!
Here's the kitchen,
Hello!  I'm Olaf from Dresden.
These are our lodgers.

Look!  Western TV.
Dear diary.
At last I can write what I really think.  As of today...
...I know all the letters.  Today we learned the last one: sharp-s.
Now I can write an important word that is often in my thoughts:
Scheiﬂe.
[Shit.]
The contestant memorizes objects passing on the belt.
If she manages to do so, she's allowed to take them home.
Take them home?
She failed again.
A coffee machine, world globe...
Now I'm 14 and just got my identity card.
From now on I'm just a number...
Number...  I'm just a number.
A personal identity number... in a system...
... in an inhuman system.
Great.
I'm now 14...
Amazing.  Reception of all three channels.
That doesn't work in Dresden.
- I'm going to watch it all the way to the end.
- Me too!
Keep moving.
Keep moving, please.
What's going on?
Yes, what's going on?  We want to go home, too, out of this damned place.
I'm going to sleep.
And now I want to write about the country where I live.
- I haven't done anything at all.
- Come along.  Come along.
Follow me, please,
Of course.
I suspect you of something,
Someone who visits as often as you...
Do you know what they can be suspected of?
Someone who comes as often as you..
is definitely a friend of our system.
Here.  Hi-fi.  Japan.
Someone tried to smuggle it but you can't play tricks on us.
What do you think when you see this?
Look carefully. It's just way too complicated.
Here...  the good old Minetta.
A switch, for on and off,
and volume control.
A plastic case, and plastic strengthens our country.
This one needs two, and just takes up space.
No one needs anything like this.
Excuse me, but you're going to get cancer from all this...
...there is asbestos everywhere in here.
In the West they say that you can get cancer from those fillings as well.
And, actually, I've never had cancer.
While we're building socialism, they're afraid of cancer
and build radios that no one can operate.
They really don't have a chance.
Everything is so gray.
Like ashes.
This country squeezes you like shoes that are too tight.
You can't move.  All you can do is dream.
Now, maybe an escape attempt?
At last.  No one can take it away from me.
No wonder everybody ran away from here, and everybody that stayed wants to leave,
and those who don't want to leave will also come along behind the rest.
Two systems.
I decided to dig my way to the West,
Darkness,
Increased risk of escape!
Alert.
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
Send up the flares.
But you, you're not going to leave me alone?
Me, and our child?
Yes, Sir, increased readiness.
Fear, the cold sweat of fear lay on my forehead
as I saw the threatening barrels of the Soviet machine-guns.
Wuschel, what's wrong?
Say something!

Both of them...
It was a double album.
I wait and wait for something that isn't happening.
I decided to establish an active resistance group myself,
and invite friends who know what life is about and who, like me, know it isn't just a game.
Refusing military service?
Do you know what it means?
Yes.
We'll show you the dictatorship of the proletariat.
- Oh, I'm out.  Completely out.
- That's what you think.
Ah, there you are, Comrade Gumprecht.
Mario?
What are you doing here?
Here you are.
We've been waiting for you.
I've been such an ass,
a file,
no work,
and I'm going to be a father soon.
You said yourself, join the organization and mix it up from inside.
What!  Who is Suzi?
Suzi!  Come on over!  Uli.
Suddenly you're grown up.
There are more good-byes, and no fewer catastrophes.
My sincerest condolences.
Mr. Fromm...
Just imagine that --
He works for a funeral company.
- Uncle Heinz is dead.
- Lung cancer.
Can l?
My brother.  He is all alone in that stupid box.
You'll be allowed to go over.  He's your brother, first generation kinship.
Had he lived here, he could have been buried next to our mother.
My sincere condolences.
He was a good man, a good friend of our system.
My mother finally found herself in the Golden West.
Just coffee.
Mrs. Ehrenreich, I'm touched by your honesty,
but for a can of coffee, we are not going to be unreasonable.
I'm home again.
I thought that I was going to wash my socks to the end of my life.
I'm telling you, it's so colorful over there. Here's a surprise - I smuggled it for you.
Coffee is quite legal. I didn't even have to smuggle it.
Wasn't there any other brand?
Take a peek inside.
That's not coffee.
No - that's Uncle Heinz.
You smuggled Uncle Heinz?
Without any formalities.
He fit right in the can.
He's become kind of small.
Here we come.
Need some flowers?
No thanks, I'll be fine.
- Is your sister home?
- How would I know?
- Can you go bring her here?
- Go up there yourself.
I lay my life at your feet.
50 DM.
Is that enough?
Sure.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
50 Western is equal to
250 Eastern.
O God!  You DO exist!
And I used to think that they kissed better in the West.
Now let me show you how to do a proper search.  Please say: Open the trunk.
When he does you look right inside and...  Comrade Orlowski, please come here.
Alert.
Combat alert.
Sometimes you are so lucky that you cannot even imagine.
I'm just a hotel valet... please...
I'm just park cars there!
Look, I bought it for 150 Marks.
Men need music.
Take a look at this.
This is virgin music by the Stones.
- Is that Keith's guitar?
- It's going to be introduced in a minute.
No shit, this can't be Stones,
Pay attention.
What a great solo.
A sensational Stones song
that no one has listened to yet...
Seriously.
Nonsense.
That bastard has deceived me,
he has stuck false labels on,
Bullshit.
Let me show you.
These are the Stones.
Unreleased songs.
We're the first to hear them.
They're banned.
Come on! We're hitting the road!
Comrade Lieutenant,
something's happening on the balcony on the second floor in the border zone.
A proper evaluation of the situation is not yet possible.
What are you saying to your shopping bag?
I'm not talking to my shopping bag, lady.
Are they allowed to do that?
Well... We can't do a thing.
Once upon a time,
there was a country, and I lived there.
If some one asks me what it was like,
it was the best time of my life,
because I was young and in love.
.
Your identity card.
Asbestos, everywhere!
I imagine one or more of you must have a question to ask?
I would think so, too.
We've got to talk.
Tough luck, asshole.
I whole-heartedly yearn.
Friends, Romans, Countrymen!
Be prepared, always prepared!
