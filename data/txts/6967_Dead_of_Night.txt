Walter Craig?
How do you do.
You're Eliot Foley?
That's right. So glad you were able to come.
Let's have your bag and put the car away afterwards.
You know it struck me after I telephoned
you. Rather cheek on my part asking...
a busy architect like yourself to come down and
spend the weekend with a set of complete strangers.
You see we're pretty cramped for space here.
We need at least two more bedrooms.
And there's only one living room?
Yes, only one living room. However we'll
go into all that in the morning, shall we.
- Know this part of the world at all?
- No, I've never been here before...
- ... not actually.
- Let me take your things.
- Ha, fancy you spotting that! Trained professional eye?
- Yes, of course
We've got several other guests, so I've put you
in the barn, but don't get worried...
- It has central heating and every modern convenience.
- The very words I was going to use.
- Listen, I expect they've started tea.
- Yes... yes, I know.
Mother, this is Mr Craig.
Oh, I'm so glad he's here.
How do you do.
Come along in.
Let me introduce you to the others...
- Mrs Cortland...
- How do you do.
- Dr Van Straaten...
- How do you do. Very pleased to meet you.
- and... Mr Grainger...
- How do you do.
- and this is Sally O'Hara.
- How do you do.
You must be tired after your drive.
Come and sit over here by the fire.
I can't tell you how delighted I am
you were able to accept my son's invitation.
You see we are both such admirers of
your work.
You'd like some tea, wouldn't you?
You take milk and sugar?
Milk and sugar, Mr Craig?
You're still there.
So it isn't a dream this time.
I beg your pardon?
...and if it isn't a dream this time..
I must be going out of my mind
Of course!
Dr van Straaten...
You're the psychiatrist.
You always treat me.
You'll treat me now won't you?
Forgive me. I don't quite understand
the joke.
It isn't a joke. I only wish it were.
I've seen you in my dream.
Sounds like a sentimental song
doesn't it.
I've dreamt about you over and over
again, doctor.
It hardly turns you into a mental case
after all recurring dreams are quite common.
But how did I come to dream about you?
I've never set eyes on you in my life.
Very likely, you have seen my photograph in the
papers. That's why my face seems familiar to you.
I don't think so. And even if it were, is that
any reason I should keep on dreaming about you?
After all, you don't mean anything
to me.
There may be an association of ideas. I may be
linked to something that means a great deal to you.
Such as?
I should have to psychoanalyse you to
find that out.
But it doesn't end there. You see, everybody
in this room is part of my dream. Everyone.
Gosh!
Good Lord, really?
You startle us!
What all of us?
I can only tell you that when I came into this
room, I recognised you all.
He has seen all our photographs in
the newspapers, has he, Dr van Staaten?
Of course, you may have seen me on the sports
page. Motor racing's my line.
And there was one of me once. In the Ponds Mertre.
When I'm the bridesmaid at my sister's wedding.
You remember. But, I shouldn't think
you've come across that.
- Well, I never had my photograph taken. - Oh yes you
did dear once. You know the one. You were 6months old.
Good Lord, that's right. I don't think he
would recognise me, I was much fatter.
Surely, Mr Craig, you might have seen any of us
some time or another. In the street or anywhere.
Yes, but why should I always dream about meeting
you all together...
...here in this room that I have
never been in in my life, until today?
Mr Craig, can you describe what happens
in your dream?
Well, not in detail, but it always starts
exactly the same as when I arrived, just now.
I turn off the main road into the lane. At the
bend in the lane, the house comes into view.
I stop, because I recognise it.
Then I drive on again, and Foley meets
me at the front door.
I recognise him, too.
And then, when I'm taking off my coat,
I have the most extraordinary feeling.
I nearly turn and run from it, because I know I am going
to come face to face with the six of you.
Well, you've only come face to face with five
of us so far, not counting Eliot.
That's right. Five of you.
- There is a sixth person who comes in later.
- Can you describe this late arrival?
- It's an attractive girl, with dark hair.
- Is that you can tell us about her?
She comes in quite unexpectedly, and says
something about not having any money.
A penniless brunette, eh...
How romantic. Do you fall madly in love
with her Mr Craig?
Have you ever told anyone
about your dream?
No. I don't think so.
Not even my wife.
Now I come to think of it, after I wake, it never
stays in my memory for more than a few seconds.
And none of it ever comes back to me until
the next time it starts.
In fact there is no evidence you ever dreamed
this dream at all, is there?
None whatever.
I haven't a scrap of proof.
Personally, I don't need any.
I believe what you claim, Mr Craig.
- I believe you really have dreamt about us all.
- So do I. -And so do I. -Me too -I didn't argue too.
I don't question that you have been
subject to a recurring dream.
And no doubt it has
a background similar to this.
It would be quite enough to account for your feeling
that you have been here before.
It's quite a common experience.
- And that's all there is to it?
- That's all there is to it!
Well, I must say its very disappointing not to give others
a leading character in some sort of supernatural drama, after all!
- Cigarette anyone? - You never know, perhaps it's like
we're beings in the story of the Looking Glass
None of us exist at all. We're nothing but
characters in Mr Craig's dream.
That's right, and when he wakes up we shall
all vanish into thin air.
Dear me, what a morbid notion!
Let's get this straight doctor, you won't for a moment
admit the possibility of forseeing the future?
Not for a moment.
Well, you'd say I was a pretty ordinary down to earth
sort of person, wouldn't you?
I refuse to commit myself. Why?
Where it comes to seeing the future, something once
happened to me that knocks your theory into a cocked hat.
Something, I'll not forget to my dying day...
Matter of fact, it very nearly was my dying day.
Now's my chance. I can't make it!
I can't make it!
One more time, passing!
Let see...
This is it!
How long is it since the crash, nurse? Six days?
No, seven doctor.
- There's no injury to the brain. I'm certain
- His mind cleared completely this morning.
He asked about the other driver. I told him he was
unhurt. He slept quite peacefully the next 2 hours
It's his temperature worries me.
Let me know at once if he wakes up again.
I shall be in number 18.
You are here Peggy!
All the way from Scotland?
All the way from Scotland.
But you're not Peggy, are you?
No, I awfully sorry.
You've been calling me Peggy for days.
- My name is Joyce.
- There's something sort of soothing about you.
- You're not going to leave me will you.
- I won't.
- Promise?
- Yes, if you promise to try and go quietly to sleep.
As you indicated.
From then on my temperature began to slide
back to normal...
to the grand job of nursing on
Joyce's part.
Tell me frankly darling. Am I out
of the wood yet?
Well, you've stopped being delirious. At least, I think so.
It's hard to tell. You talk such nonsense....
- I still have awful bad nightmares. - Nightmares?
I thought you said you always dreamt about me
So I do. I dream you turn me down and get
married to Dr Albury instead.
You needn't worry. He has a wife and
3 children.
Oh, good for him!
It's a lovely night.
Quarter to ten,
Long past your bedtime.
Listen darling, I'll put it to you. There's only one way to kill
me permanently, and that's to marry me! It your professional duty.
- You've got a hope! Good night.
- Good night... darling.
Just room for one inside, sir.
Couldn't have been a dream. I didn't have time
to fall asleep.
- Nurse had only just left me.
- Yes you checked the time. It was no more than 5 minutes.
- Does that mean I going crackers?
- My dear chap, of course not.
In the split second before your car crashed, You were
firmly convinced you were going to be killed, weren't you.
- Yes. Yes, I was.
- That fear has remained with you.
I not conscious of it. Oh, you mean my
subconscious mind
You'd already passed the purely
physical crisis.
That apparition effect is what we call
the psychological crisis.
Yes maybe. But suppose I go on
seeing things?
You won't. In fact, I'll lay you 2 to 1 in
pounds, we'll have you out of here in a week.
It's a bet. If I lose I win.
As a matter of fact, I won...
That is I lost, if you see what I mean.
Albury was right. I made marvellous headway and was
able to left the nursing home before the week was over.
Excuse me, can you tell me
the time?
- Yes, it's quarter past four.
- Thank you.
Just room for one inside, sir.
So you see, if I hadn't seen that man driving
the hearse, I wouldn't be alive to tell the tale.
Bit sick for the passengers on the bus
wasn't it?
Yes, the hearse driver might have tipped
them off too!
Perhaps he did, dear. But perhaps they were
all doubting Thomases like Dr van Straaten
This time you have got
your evidence doctor!
Mr. Grainger told the specialist about the
hearse before he went to catch the bus.
I'm afraid that does not prove that the bus conductor
had the features of the hearse driver
...or that he said,
"There's room for one inside. "
But he had and he did.
Nothing will ever fix it. That hearse driver
was sent to me as a warning.
- I agree. Otherwise, why didn't he board the bus?
- Exactly
Because he hadn't recovered completely yet.
Your were still upset by your crash. It made you
reluctant to board any kind of vehicle, didn't it.
Sorry doctor, I'll not buy that one.
Well maybe it's as well.
You cling to your beliefs my boy...
...that providence is specially
concerned about your survival.
It's no use Grainger. We're both in the same
boat. We'll never convince him.
What Dr van Straaten wants is genuine first hand
evidence. The kind that would satisfy judge and jury.
And neither of us are able to
produce that...
...yet.
Darling, where on earth
did you spring from.
Brenda suddenly changed her mind
about staying up in town.
Would you pay the taxi, darling.
I spent my last penny on the train fare.
- Hello Eliot.
- Hello Joyce.
- Oh my dear, I am glad to see you...
- Your penniless brunette. Alright, I'll pay the taxi
...made it onto Charing Cross and just caught the 3:15
A delightful surprise, my dear...
...though no surprise to Mr Craig.
Let me introduce you. Mr Craig Mrs Grainger,
your dream come true.
Yes, she's the sixth person.
Sixth person. Are you playing
some sort of a game?
Well, not exactly a game, my dear.
Mr Craig has been dreaming about you for years.
Well, not only you darling - all
of us.
Come upstairs and take your things off. It's all perfectly
simple really. It's just like your husband's hearse.
I don't mean his hearse. I mean the one he saw when
he was in your nursing home.
Or rather the one Dr van Straaten said
he didn't see.
Oh dear, I think I had better start again.
You see, Mr Craig has been having
the most dreadful dreams.
Penniless brunette laid on
according to plan.
How's that for evidence doctor?
That's when you say it's a pure coincidence?
- Oh, you can't say that doctor.
- The odds are a million to one against.
You know, I am a little indignant.
I am driven to the conclusion it's all part
of a very carefully prearranged plan.
An extraordinarily elaborate practical joke
at my expense.
- Oh really! - Do you seriously think
we'd cook the whole thing up between us?
Well as an explanation, it's not any more
farfetched than Mr Craig's.
Then the jokes on me too,
for I didn't know anything about it
A funny sort of practical joke.
It isn't funny.
What conceivable motive do you
think we possibly could have had?
Ah! No doubt you thought it would be very amusing to
watch my cherished disbeliefs being shattered.
Mmm. Very clever of us, I must say.
I wonder if we have any more surprises
up our sleeves?
That's it. Your glasses.
What about my glasses?
Later on, we're having drinks...
You break those glasses of yours, and then
quite suddenly the room goes dark.
Then, Foley, you say something... something
about the death of a man I've never heard of.
And that's where my dream becomes
a nightmare...
...a nightmare of horror.
Horror? What sort of horror?
I feel my will power draining away.
I feel I'm in the grip of a force that's driving
me towards something unspeakably evil.
It shows that you have some heavy
weight on your conscience.
Now, in my opinion...
I am no longer interested in your opinion.
You shook me at first with your ingenious theories.
I thought perhaps the whole thing was
a delusion.
But Mrs Grainger's arrival has altered
all this.
I have been here before
in my dream.
For some reason, I've been given
foreknowledge of the future
Why?
I don't know.
I want to know.
I must know.
Sally, dear, I think perhaps it's
time you were going off home now.
Mother means she wouldn't want your
infant mind warped, my pretty.
- I'm sorry, Sally. I didn't want mean my fear to frighten you.
- You're all right, Mr Craig, it didn't.
All the same, I'll go if
you like...
But it seems rather silly to me, considering
like last time I saw them.
Some what?
Subconscious thingamajigs, or whatever
Dr van Straaten would say that they are
I had an absolutely staggering one. Last year.
Save it up for the school magazine.
I'll go and run you along home.
Thanks for the nice tea, Eliot, and for
calling me a liar. Good afternoon
Please let her stay, Mrs Foley. I should
like to hear about your subconscious thingamajigs.
You would? Not that it'll
cut any ice with you.
Well, we were spending Christmas
down in Somerset.
I'd been asked over to a party by an
old school friend of my mother's.
A Mrs Watson.
There were a lot of other kids there.
Mostly younger than Jimmy Watson and I were
so we let them choose the games.
Nobody else could have such a silly nose.
It's Jimmy.
Ah, you should talk.
What shall we play now?
- Sardines
- All right, sardines, it is.
- Sardines? - Don't you know about
sardines? It's a sort of hide and seek.
Who's to hide?
Alright.
Now anywhere in the house bar the kitchen.
Cook's in a state.
- But I don't know my way about the house.
- So much the worse for you.
I'll count 30.
Turn your backs every one.
Off you go. Come on quickly!
Got you!
- It's alright. I'll go quietly
- Shhh.
I'll pack here with you. When somebody else
finds us, they pack in too, like sardines.
Oh, its cold, in here.
Cold eh? That better?
No mortal cold, Sally. It's a cold from
beyond the grave..
What are you talking about?
Believe it or not, this house in haunted.
I don't believe it.
Well everyone around this part
of the world says it is.
I'll bite. Tell me!
Shh, they're bound to find us here.
Oh, I know a much better place. Come on.
Go on about your precious ghost.
Well, there was a murder committed
here in 1860, I think it was. Come on.
The girl who did it...
must have been crackers, I suppose really,
Strangled him and then half cut his head off.
- How revolting.
- Course, there's lots more...
- ... but, you're too young.
- And where does the ghost come in?
Well, I don't know really. Nobody's heard or seen
anything actually. We've been here 6 months.
I expect it's the girl going
around in a long white nightgown.
Whistling winds...
Clanking chains...
Blood curdling screams.
I suppose she's seeking forgiveness
for her crime.
- Search me. I say give us a kiss, Sal.
- No Jimmy, it against the rules for sardines.
Hi, Sally.
Sally, wait for me.
Who's there?
What is it darling?
Come on now, stop crying
Did you get separated from
the others?
Let's go downstairs, where its
nice and warm,
No. Stay with me.
It's better now you've come.
Isn't it silly of me. I don't
remember noticing you downstairs.
- Are you one of the Headingly children?
- My name is Francis, Francis Kent.
This is my bedroom, mine
and Constance's.
- Constance?
- She's my half sister. She's grown up.
- ... like you.
- I didn't notice her either.
All the other guests were much
younger than me.
I wish you were my sister.
You're so kind and nice.
Why? Is she unkind to you darling?
She hates me. She said she'd
like to kill me.
Oh don't. You poor little thing.
But I'll be quite safe now,
now that I've met you.
I'll be able to sleep.
Poor Francis. Come along,
I'll help you.
- Has anyone tried the play room?
- Nanny insisted on locking it and she's got the keys.
Gosh! We've forgotten the linen cupboard.
Come on.
- Good night.
- Goodbye.
- Sally! Sally, Where are you?
- Please give up
- I can't find her anywhere. Sally!
- Sally! Sally!
It's alright.
Here I am.
There you are! I was wondering
where on earth you'd got to.
I found another door behind the wardrobe,
went along a corridor and then into the room at the end.
Oh there! But that's where the
whole thing happened. Hi! Sally!
Meet your new Nanny, Mrs Watson!
What do you mean dear?
I found myself in a sort of nursery.
I didn't know any of the children were staying the night.
Staying the night.?
Why yes. This little boy said he was
sharing a room with a sister.
Which little boy?
He told me his name was... was um...
Francis Kent.
- Francis Kent?
- Come off it Sally. So you knew all the time.
Knew what?
About Constance Kent murdering
her brother, Francis, of course.
I didn't know. So that...
that little boy was...
I'm not frightened...
I'm not frightened.
Oh! Please hold me tight... oh
hold me tight.
Mother said I must be sickening for something, and
made me stay in bed with three hot water bottles.
She didn't believe a word of it,
anymore than Dr van Straaten does.
In the past of course that type of experience
was then frequent among saints.
St Joan, for example, and St Theresa record some
visitations of an exceedingly tangible character
- I'm in jolly good company then.
- Not at all my dear.
I decline to believe that you are on such
an exalted spiritual plane.
I think you are all being ridiculously weak minded
letting Dr van Straaten lay down the law.
When I was a nurse, I came across a lot of things
that doctors didn't just dismiss in an airy fashion.
I believe in Sally's story
and in Mr Craig's dream.
Good for you, darling!
So we're all powerless in grip of Craig's dream.
That's a solemn thought!
I think it's awfully exciting
Well, if I am a puppet and
Mr Craig's pulling the strings.
The least he can do is to tell me a little bit
more about the part
- ... he's giving me to play.
- I wish it were as easy as that.
Trying to remember a dream
is like, how shall I put it,...
Being out at night
in a thunderstorm.
There's a flash of lightning and for one brief
moment, everything stands out vivid and starkly.
And what have the lightning flashes
illuminated so far?
One thing is very vivid and very horrible.
I hit Sally savagely, viciously.
Oh no you won't, I shall stick close
to Mr Grainger. He's bigger than you.
But anyway, it isn't consistent. I shan't have
a chance to, because you leave here quite soon.
Quite suddenly.
- You're certain of that?
- Absolutely certain.
Splendid. Then I suggest Sally stays to
dinner. That'll break the spell.
An admirable suggestion.
- It's absolutely thrilling. I'll ring Mum and get her OK.
- Tell her, Eliot will run you back in the car.
Mother!
Really Sally, this is too bad! Oh, good afternoon
Mrs Foley, do please forgive this invasion.
You know quite well, it's your Uncle Edwin's birthday. Well actually,
he's her godfather, but she always calls him uncle, you understand.
And not to leave a message or anything, but of course I
guessed you'd be here. Must be a thorough nuisance.
Now come along rush dear,
we are hours late
But mother, I can't! You see this is Mr Craig,
and I'm one of the characters in his dream.
Oh, how do you do. Such fun charades.
Still, you do understand don't you?
And poor Edwin's so terribly sensitive.
Now come along dear.
Mother, you must listen. You see
Mr Craig is going to hit me savagely.
Oh, well I'm sure he can hit somebody else instead. Now come
along dear. Don't forget you're dining with us on Tuesday.
- That'll teach you to mess about with Mr Craig's dream, Ma.
- Oh really, I don't know what to say.
I am surprised Mr Craig didn't remember
Sally's mother. She seems to me most memorable.
Now look doctor, if Craig had told you she was coming and
exactly what she'd be wearing and the very words she'd say
You would still have thought
the dream was all baloney.
Good for you, darling!
I'm becoming quite alarmed, by the end of this
evening, I shall be just as credulous as any of you.
Mr Craig, I can only say the more incredulous
the doctor becomes, the more I believe you.
- Thank you.
- Doctor, I hoped you'd be able to explain to me.
...a happening, which to put it
mildly, has always puzzled me.
I shall try.
It started a few weeks after we became engaged.
It was April 9th, to be exact.
I remember the date, because
it was Peter's birthday.
You know how difficult it is choosing presents for a man.
They always seem to have everything they want.
- Oh hello darling.
- Hello Peter. Take it through will you.
- What on earth's that?
- A little birthday present.
Put it on the couch will you.
- What is it, a kite?
- Why don't you open it and see.
Right. Suppose you fix us a drink.
You haven't gone and had your
portrait painted, have you?
No. I thought you'd like
to look at yourself.
- Darling, it's a beauty.
- You really like it?
- Love it. - Well it's certainly an improvement
on that barbolla thing your aunt gave you.
Yes, that is pretty grim. I always felt I was looking
at a gift horse in the mouth. This is a honey.
Where did you find it?
Chichester. Very expensive.
Happy birthday darling!
- What sort of journey did you have?
- Came by road. Got a lift.
Don't tell me - let me guess...
Not old faithful?
The same.
Poor old Guy. What will he do when
we get married.
Hardly the big game shooting type is he?
Hardly. He nearly put us into a ditch
coming up, trying to avoid a rabbit.
Fellow feeling obviously.
You be careful. I'm very fond
of that.
You mean it's easy with your disgusting
feminine vanity to have him on a string.
A spaniel would do just as well.
- Mmm. Spaniels don't have nice comfortable Bentleys, do they.
- You've got something there.
How's that?
Most professional.
I'm glad to see you're going
to be useful about the house.
Handsome couple!
What's that?
Nothing. I thought I saw something.
What sort of something?
Don't know quite.
What a little man about so
high in a bowler hat?
- What have you been drinking for lunch?
- One pint of bitter.
- You know I think I've been very generous.
- So do I. Nicest present I've ever had.
- What shall we do tonight? Dress up.
Spend a lot of money? - Why not?
- You've almost worn out those stairs.
- Well, we've danced enough anyway.
Darling, is anything the matter?
No. Why?
I don't know. You seem to be
a bit broody all evening.
A bit limp with the heat, I expect.
- Sure, there's nothing the matter?
- No nothing really.
That usually means there is something really.
What is it?
- It sounds so damn silly.
- Nevermind. Tell me.
Well, you know that mirror you gave me... didn't
get it at one of those joke shops, by any chance?
No, of course not. Why?
Well, when I was dressing this evening, just as I was tying
my tie, I suddenly realised the reflection was all wrong
What do you mean "wrong"?
Well, it wasn't my room I was seeing.
It was some other room.
- Darling!
- I told you it sounded silly.
It only lasted for a moment, but
I could have sworn I saw it.
Some sort of optical illusion, I suppose.
All done with mirrors, in fact.
The next few weeks we were pretty
busy house hunting.
In the end we found quite a
pleasant house in Chelsea.
And of course, I had all the usual chaos
getting ready for the wedding.
I noticed that Peter seemed preoccupied and
a bit jumpy and irritable.
But I thought it was just
eve of wedding nerves.
Anyhow, I was so busy I didn't have
time to think much about it.
What a day. Helen's got measles, blast her, so I will
have to try and find another bridesmaid somewhere.
The cakes under control, and
I've got lots more answers.
The Laughtons can't come thank heaven.
We've got some perfectly frightful presents.
You know darling, I really think we have to turn
that spare room of ours into a chamber of horrors.
Which reminds me - when are
the men coming to lay the carpet.
Oh, I don't know.
I forgot to ring up.
Oh really darling, here am I getting worn out chasing around getting
things done and you can't even remember a simple little telephone call.
For heaven's sake, don't nag.
Sorry. I didn't mean to say that.
Peter, what's the matter with you?
You've been edgy for days.
Yes, I know.
I haven't been sleeping too well.
I really am sorry darling.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Forget it.
Listen darling, I know you fairly well by now.
You're keeping something from me.
What is it?
Well, if you must know,
it's that mirror.
You remember me telling you that first evening.
Well, it's got worse.
Much worse. Every time I look in it now
I see that room.
It's getting me down.
I'd really rather not talk about it.
You'll feel much better if you do.
It's no good bottling things up you know.
Well, at first, if I made an
enormous effort of will.
The reflection used to change back
to what it ought to be.
But lately, however hard I try,
it doesn't change anymore.
The only thing to do...
...is to try not to look in it at all.
But in a queer sort of way
it fascinates me.
I feel as if that room,
the one in the mirror...
...were trying to... to claim me,
...to draw me into it.
It almost becomes the real room
and my own bedroom imaginary.
And I know there's something waiting
for me on the other side of the mirror.
Something evil...
monstrously evil.
And that if I cross that dividing line,
something awful will happen.
Well let's get rid of the beastly thing.
You know you don't have to keep it
just because I've given it to you.
I can take it back and they'll change it.
The trouble is not in the mirror.
It's in my mind. It must be.
A mirror's just wood and glass.
Peter, I don't know what to say.
Perhaps, you're overworked.
Why don't you see a doctor?
I have. He couldn't
find anything wrong with me.
- I think I shall have to go and see a mental specialist.
- Oh nonsense! You're as sane as I am.
Obviously, I can't be.
Listen... I've been putting off saying this.
But I think we ought to postpone
the wedding.
- That's a bit drastic isn't it.
- I don't know. Suppose I am going mad.
Wouldn't be much fun for you, would it?
Take you 5 years to get a divorce.
Really darling, you're going
a little bit too fast for me.
Let's get the wedding over, and then we can
start making divorce arrangements afterwards.
Peter, come with me will you.
Look in the mirror.
Look in the mirror.
What is it, darling?
It's worse than ever.
- You're not there.
- But of course I'm there.
I tell you, you're not.
In the other room, I'm alone.
Look in the mirror and tell me
exactly what you see.
It's just as it always is.
Instead of my bed,
there's the other bed.
I see it quite clearly.
The posts have vine leaves twisted around
them, with bunches of grapes at the top.
The hangings are dark red silk...
The walls are panelled.
There's a log fire burning in the grate.
It's no use I tell you.
I am going mad.
Now listen to what I see...
No four poster, no panelling,
and no log fire.
Just your ordinary room
with you and me in it.
Listen to me...
...you're going to look in this mirror again.
You're going to see exactly the same as I do.
Come here. Come here.
- Can you see your own room?
- No
- Or me?
- No.
But you must!
Make yourself.
I can't.
You can darling, if you try.
- It's no good.
- You can.
Look, there I am.
Standing by you.
Yes...
Yes, there you are.
I can see you now.
You see?
I told you so!
- I can't make it out.
- Come on, let's get out of here and have a drink.
So that seemed to be that. A fortnight later,
we got married and moved into the new house
In a way, I didn't mind getting rid of the mirror
But Peter said it was complete nonsense to be scared of it.
So I decided to let things be.
Mother says, can we come down the
weekend after next. It's her birthday.
Afraid, I shan't be able to make it.
We'll be rushing that big audit through.
Oh well, nevermind. She'll be disappointed
but we can go some other time.
Well you can go, sweet, anyhow
even if I can't.
I don't want to go without you.
Don't want you to. But your
mother would rather have you alone.
You know, getting her precious
daughter back for a few days.
Don't be an idiot. She doesn't feel she's
lost a daughter. She's gained a son.
What gift for a phrase you have.
Go over, anyhow.
- Hello?
- Hello Peter
Oh hello darling. Have a good journey?
- Yes. I wish you could have come.
- So do I. Still it can't be helped.
- Do you miss me?
- Of course I do. Do you miss me?
- Yes. Gone to bed yet?
- No, I'm going to do another half hours work first.
- Well good night darling. - Good night darling.
See you Monday. Give my love to your mother.
- Your number?
- Flaxman 6061.
Get me Chichester 2352.
Thank you.
What is it dear?
Nothing.
Mother, I want to speak with Mr Rutherford.
Would you go on to the library, and then walk back this way?
Very well, dear.
- Morning Mr Rutherford.
- Good morning Miss Watts. I beg your pardon, Mrs Courtland.
Do you remember that Chippendale mirror
I bought here about 3 months ago.
Indeed I do. I hope your
husband was satisfied with it.
Yes, very.
Tell me...
That bed. The four poster...
How odd that you should mention it. Why, it so happens,
I bought it at the same sale that I got your mirror.
There's a curious history
attaching to them both.
- Curious?
- Well, tragic perhaps I should say.
I trust, by the way, that
you are not superstitious.
No... No I don't think so.
Won't you sit down.
Some people would think it possible that I should
be lying with regard to these matters.
Please, Mr Rutherford, will you
tell me the story.
I'm very interested.
By all means.
The bed and mirror form part of the
contents of the private apartments...
...of a Mr Francis Etherington,
who died at Marsden Lacy in 1836.
The apartment has remained unused and
locked from that time until the sale.
That is his portrait, by the way.
He was a man of dominating character.
Arrogant, fractious,
handsome and of a violent temper.
He married a very beautiful heiress.
A Miss Perott.
The couple retired to Marsden Lacy where they lived
contentedly for a time.
Then suddenly disaster overtook them.
Out hunting one day, Etherington was thrown
by his horse, which then rolled on him.
His spine was injured.
He was never again able to do more than
drag himself a few paces from this bed.
How dreadful.
Yes. Unfortunately the effects of such
constraint on a man of his enormous energy...
Was more than his mind could endure.
He became morose and bitter
suspicious above all of his wife.
Quite without reason, he began
accusing the poor lady of betraying him.
With his friends... with strangers...
with his servants.
Had she not been so devoted to him, she certainly would have left
him, and indeed it would have been better for her had she done so.
For one day,
in an excess of jealous rage
He strangled her, and then
sat down in front of the mirror...
your mirror...
and cut his throat.
What a horrible story.
Then the mirror...
hadn't been used again until Peter...
- ... until I bought it for my husband.
- Exactly.
Peter. Peter. Peter darling.
Oh there you are!
Something gone wrong with
your plans for a weekend?
- Darling, what do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.
Of course you haven't.
Of course, you didn't think I suspected anything,
when you were so eager to go away without me.
Well, I'm not a fool.
I knew what your game was.
Darling, stop please.
Sit down and listen to me.
I will not sit down. I know you'd like to have me chained
to this chair and to have me chained to this room.
But I won't stand it, not while
I've strength to move at all.
Darling, sit down and listen to me.
You're not well.
And a good thing for you and
your precious lover that I'm not.
I can move out of this room
and break him in pieces.
Peter, it's the mirror. I've found out
what's wrong with the mirror.
There's nothing wrong with the mirror.
I look in it often.
I sit here and look
at these four walls.
Then for a change I look
at them in the mirror.
You don't know what you're saying!
This isn't Marsden Lacy. Your name isn't Etherington.
It's Cortland, Peter Cortland and I'm your wife.
Exactly, you're my wife, but
you sometimes choose to forget it.
Well? What's the matter?
Why did you come back?
No, let me guess.
You were enjoying a pleasant weekend
with Guy, but he was called away.
So you had to come back to me.
Peter, I haven't even seen Guy.
Anyhow, you know we've always treated him
as a joke.
Yes, I know we've always treated him as a joke.
But I knew what was going all the time.
Nothing's been going on.
You know that as well as I do.
I pretended not to notice,
day after day...
...month after month.
While you were making a public laughing stock of me.
But this time, I've had enough
I going to punish you...
as you deserve to be punished.
Peter. It's the mirror. Mr Rutherford told me
about it. That's why I came back.
It belonged to a man who's crippled and who
accused his wife, just as you're now accusing me.
Peter, you must listen to me.
Peter. Peter, darling
are you alright?
- I seem to have cut myself.
- Sit down let me have a look at it.
Look at the mirror.
How did that happen?
Nevermind now, darling.
- But darling, we could get it mended.
- No we can't. Look, it's old and worm eaten and rotten.
It should have been burned ages ago.
You poor darling!
Well, I think you could do with a drink after that...
I know I could.
Mother, what did you do with that bottle
of schnapps that I got for Dr van Straaten
It's in the cupboard in the hall.
Well, hows the great debunker
going to debunk that?
Ever since Mr Craig arrived, you've been asking me to
produce scientific explanations like rabbits out of a hat.
I am not accustomed to solving complex problems
with the careless ease of your brains trust.
It sounds to me as though
you are completely stumped this time.
Joan saw the room in the mirror
as well as Peter.
The witness I couldn't
supply you with.
Very well.
You asked for it.
This was a case of crypto-amnesia.
The transmissabilty of an illusion
by one person to one or more other persons
who are emotionally cohesive.
is well established.
Do I make myself clear?
I'm certainly at sea.
You wouldn't like to start again would you
very slowly and in words of one syllable?
Hamlet was right, doctor.
There are more things in heaven and earth
than are dreamed of in your philosophy.
And my recurring dream isn't just
a meaningless trick of the mind.
It was sent to me
as a warning.
A warning against the terror that's
waiting for me in this house.
Well, I'm like Grainger.
I'm going to act on the warning.
I'm going to leave here, now,
this instant.
Craig, if you go now
you'll be making profound mistake.
You'll be delivering yourself
into the hands of your obsession.
I beg you to stay,
and see it through.
Whatever happens, if anything happens
the reality can't be possibly be
as bad as your imagination has painted it.
Why not?
I tell you doctor, there's something horrible
awaiting for me here, perhaps even death itself.
Craig. An hour ago,
you asked me to help you.
I think I can, but
only if you want me to,
only if you do what I beg you to do.
While every minute brings the horror closer?
No doctor, I'm not going to submit my will to yours.
I'm going to leave this place now,
before it too late.
What's your tipple by the way?
Scotch?
No thanks, I'm going.
I can't face it.
Oh, I'm sorry my dear fellow,
however, I don't blame you a bit.
Oh yes you do. You despise me.
You think I'm a contemptible coward.
Nothing of the kind, honestly.
Still, I'm sorry because, well whatever's going to wind a fellow,
I'd like to rally round, lend a helping hand and all that sort of rot.
- Nobody can help me.
- Tell you what. Have one for the road.
- Well...
- Matter of fact I know just how you feel.
Jolly unpleasant, when you come
slap up against the supernatural.
I still get a shiver when I think about what happened
to a couple of friends of mine. Ghastly business.
It was when I was staying at
my golf club at Wittlesham.
The stars at the club were
George Parratt and Larry Potter.
Nothing could keep them from their game.
They were both pretty good and they were
deadly rivals, but only on the links.
In all other respects,
they were the best of friends.
Until... Mary
Mary seemed to look on them
with equal favour.
And the result, of course,
was complete deadlock.
It can't go on like this, old man.
She's ruining my game.
Mine too.
Every time I take a stroke,
I see her wretched face.
I keep on hearing her tiresome voice,
just as I'm swinging.
They'll be raising our handicaps soon.
She must choose one of us.
But there's nothing to choose.
We're both as good as Bobby Jones.
Very nearly.
Wish you were dead, old man.
It'd be just as good, if you were.
- George, I've got it!
- What?
- We'll play for her.
- Tomorrow morning. 18 holes.
- Match play.
- Loser to vanish from the scene.
- Forever.
- Put it there, old man.
Of course, why didn't we think
of it sooner.
It was a terrific game.
They halved the first four holes.
Then Parratt sliced his drive
and Potter took the lead.
But at the long thirteenth,
Parratt got a wonderful four...
and after that, it was ding dong all the way.
Parratt Potter. Potter Parratt
When they reached the last hole,
they were square once more.
This hole for Mary Lee...
- How many, old man?
- Three.
- And you?
- Two.
Two?!
Yes. Didn't you see my spoon shot?
Beautiful shot, wasn't it Smithers?
Oh, a lovely shot sir.
Nobody's ever reached this green in 2 before.
I don't believe it's possible.
- There it is. No mistake is there, Smithers?
- No sir. Quite right, sir. Only 2 strokes.
Mm. Seems as if I've got my work
cut out then.
Ho ho. Jolly good putt old man.
Well, here's for it...
Well, that's that!
Grand finish and grand game.
An almost incredible finish.
With Mary in the bag, Parratt realised it was
time to turn his mind once more to serious things.
He hadn't touched his clubs since the
Potter tragedy and he needed practice.
I offered to give him a game. I soon found to my
cost he was playing better than ever.
My bobs seemed very good to him.
And then we reached the lake
Good morning, George old man.
Still cheating?
Oh yes, it's me alright.
I've returned from my watery grave.
...to haunt you.
Cheat! Cad! Twister!
Worm! Skunk! Rat!
Rabbit!
Ho ho ho. Oh, I'll teach you
that crime doesn't pay.
Unconditional surrender, old man.
Those are my terms.
May the Lord have mercy on your handicap.
- I say, Eliot...
- Yes, old man?
- Do you believe in ghosts?
- Ghosts?
Good Lord, no.
Neither do I.
That was only the beginning.
For this poor stricken shadow of a man
there was only one living.
Another whiskey Fred.
A large one.
Make it two.
Heavens! I thought you were dead.
So I am old man,
as dead as a stymie.
Two large whiskeys, Fred.
You mean a quadruple, sir?
No no no. Separate glasses of course.
One for him.
Fred can't see me or hear me. Nobody else
can either. It's only you I'm haunting.
Well, it's time you gave somebody
else a turn. I've had it.
Not bad, am I, for a beginner.
George Parratt, handicap 18!
- I think it's perfectly despicable.
- Not nearly despicable as cheating at golf.
- You haven't a vestige of proof
- Yes I have. It's on the record.
- What record? - The recording angel's record.
It shows there you took 5 for the 18th.
5 shillings please sir.
Recording angel!
It can't count.
Listen now, you're going too far,
to start all that on the link.
You don't expect me to stop there, old man.
All the stuff, I did, was very elementary.
Any rabbit could do it.
A ghost must better himself.
You mean to say, you're going to
hang around me for the rest of my life?
I most certainly am. Unless of course,
you try to lay me.
- How? - Well, first of all,
you must give up Mary.
Give up Mary?
Certainly not!
I'm not going to have a fine young
girl like that married to a cheat and a liar.
I suppose I've got it coming to me.
It would break my heart of course.
Listen, if you promise to let me alone,
I'll step out of Mary's life.
Well, that's my first condition.
The second is...
- You'll have to give up golf.
- Give up golf!?
Never.
Don't you realise what you've done?
You've disgraced this club.
besmirched the greatest of all games
dragged the name of St Andrew in the dust.
Good heavens man, you should be
drummed out of the Royal and Ancient.
Oh yes yes yes, I admit all of this.
I'm a cad, a rat and a worm.
I agree with everything you've called me.
But you can't punish me like this.
Listen Larry, you're golfer yourself.
You must realise what it means.
I should have nothing left to live for. Nothing.
You can't be such an accountant.
Perhaps, you're right old man
- I mustn't lower myself to your level.
- Dear old Larry. I knew you'd see it the right way.
- But you've got to break with Mary.
- And if I do, you'll never haunt me again?
I'll disappear here and now, forever.
Ah, it's a deal.
One for the sky.
No thanks, I've got a date with St Andrew
at 4 o'clock.
Oh goodbye, old boy. Good luck.
Hope you win.
Thanks George. Goodbye.
What's the matter?
My powers have gone.
I'd better try again.
George, I've forgotten how to vanish.
Look here, old man.
That's shocking.
I can get as far as this,
then I can't remember what I do next.
You must remember. Don't forget
you've been well and truly laid.
I know I've got to hold my breath
and do this...
But then I get stuck.
Well, what about that.
No good? Well, try this.
No good. No good.
Oh I am sorry.
But give us a kick. I mean, a ghost shouldn't be allowed
to go haunting until he's properly qualified.
It's all my fault, I'm afraid. I should
have spent longer on the materialisation course...
but you would insist
on getting married on Saturday.
- I still intend to get married on Saturday.
- Oh but you promised.
You can't keep your side of the bargain.
Why should you expect me to keep mine?
- I see your point. You realise what it will mean though?
- What?
- Well, I shall have to stick to you, everywhere.
Everywhere?
Yes. Always remain within 6 foot of you.
That's the official ruling.
Because, a chap becomes a ghost, it surely
doesn't mean that he ceases to be a gentleman.
Don't worry, old chap,
it's sure to come back to me before Saturday.
It was unbelievable, I was on the green in 2,
down in 3. That's how I collected that one.
Well fancy that..
- Now then, this is the Wackerbath cup.
- Wacker
Yes, I beat poor old Larry Potter 7 and 5.
2 and 1...
Mookiest game you ever played!
7 and 5!
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Now this one here's a long story.
Darling, you can tell me all
about that tomorrow.
Kiss me.
George!
- Yes my pet? - You haven't given me
one real kiss since we left the church!
Yes, I know, darling, I know.
We've been very busy.
Get on with it. Get on with it, you mug.
That's what you're here for.
Well, we're not busy now.
Gracious, ten already!
Is it darling, I didn't count!
Well, I think I'll be turning in, then.
Yes, I think I'll turn in too.
I'm really rather tired.
So am I.
- Six feet, old man!
- Six feet
I don't wonder...
I'll just go and count the cups.
- Count the cups? - Yes, I'll count the cups.
I always count the cups before I go to bed.
Really, this is intolerable.
Yes, I quite agree,
but what can I do everything's failed?
Have another go.
Try as you've never tried before.
Alright, for what it's worth
Shut your eyes...
help you to concentrate.
OK, here goes.
- Ohh, of all the dirty tricks. I can't think what's come over you.
- It's entirely your fault. You can't cheat a ghost.
What the devil are we going to do now?
I shall have to go on trying.
That's all.
Don't you see, you blithering idiot. There may be millions
of other combinations, and all you can do is this.
What comes next? Oh!
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
But he's gone?
And I wasn't looking.
What's going to happen now?
- Darling. Oh, darling.
- Do I make parsnips?
Or do I make muffins?
Really Eliot, that story is totally incredible
and decidedly improper.
Sorry. I had to tell it.
I couldn't bear to be left out in the cold.
That wasn't why you told the story.
You did it to try and help me, didn't you?
You succeeded, where I failed Eliot.
And in a double sense.
Craig, you said that the horror started when Eliot
told about the death of a man, you'd never heard of.
- Didn't you?
- That's right.
Well, Eliot just described how his friend
Potter committed suicide.
- You'd never heard of Potter before, had you?
- No. No, I hadn't.
Yet the horror hasn't started, has it?
- No, it hasn't.
- There you are, you see.
I'm so glad.
The spell has been broken at last.
Now, I can go and see about dinner with an easy mind.
- I'll lend a hand, if I may?
- Oh, thank you my dear. That's very kind of you.
Oh, Mr Craig, now that you've met us
I'm sure you wouldn't dream of dreaming about us again.
Come along, my dear.
Apart from my bit of nonsense, the curious thing is that all of you,
even Sally, seems to have had one of these extraordinary experiences.
Well, perhaps, they aren't so extraordinary.
Perhaps they happen to most people.
Oh you mean there's a ghost as well as
a skeleton in everyone's cupboard.
That's a pretty thought.
What's the ghost in your cupboard, doctor?
Well, there was one occasion in my professional career
that made me wonder.
Made me wonder quite a lot.
You may remember the case.
Maxwell Frere, the ventriloquist
was charged with the attempted murder
of a man in the same line of business,
Sylvester Kee, an American.
My friend Maurice Olcott, who was defending the case,
wanted my opinion on the state of his mind.
Hello Frere,
this is Dr Van Straaten.
He's going to help us
with the case.
How do you do, Mr Frere. I had the pleasure of seeing
your performance last year at the Haye. It was most...
Doctor eh?
A brain specialist?
Psychiatrist.
I thought as much.
You want to psychoanalyse me, don't you?
Want to look inside my brain and see
how the wheels turn around.
Now wait a moment Frere...
Dissect me like a guinea pig,
Then show me off to you distinguished colleagues
as an interesting case.
Well, that's it, isn't it?
Hardly, but it's possible that I may be able
to help you if you are prepared to help me.
Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You're wasting your time, doctor.
I'm not mad.
I don't want your help.
Nor yours either.
Hugo's the only one who can help me.
- The dummy?
- Yes, the police are holding it as evidence.
Hugo should be here with me.
You see...
- He's more to blame for all this, than I am.
- What exactly do you mean by that?
You'd like to know, wouldn't you?
Well get Hugo back and perhaps you will.
Perhaps, you'll have a case sure to make your complexes stand on end.
And you can write a big fat book all about it, eh?
Does that tempt you, doctor?
Very well then, get Hugo back.
Now you see what I'm up against?
Very interesting.
- I'd like to have a talk with that other fellow, Kee.
- I'm afraid that's out of the question. He's a witness for the prosecution.
Have a look at his statement.
I'd like to know what you think of it.
Seems more like your job than mine.
I knew Maxwell Frere by reputation
as an artiste of the highest standing
in his and my profession.
I first made his acquaintance
about a year ago when
he was performing at the
Chez Beulah Night Club in Paris.
Ladies and gentlemen, is there a Frenchman in the house?
I am told that one or two have been seen in Paris lately.
Sylvester Kee!
Well hullo, Beulah!
- Boy, I haven't seen you for years. Where have you been?
- Oh, back in the States.
I just hit town.
- Well, how's business?
- Mighty fine, honey child, mighty fine.
Hey, you old war horse. You look terrific.
Just like the lights of Broadway on a dark night.
Say Beulah, this guy Frere,
they tell me he's pretty good.
- I'll say he is.
- What's he got that I haven't got?
His dummy.
Don't say you haven't seen him?
Well, what are we waiting for.
Come on, let's go in.
If we had to do this routine in the Coliseum,
the act would be in ruins.
Coliseum,? Ruins?
I kill myself sometimes.
Not this one. Not this one.
Don't be shy, Hugo,
the lady won't bite you.!
No, but you know me.
I might bite the lady!
Come my little lotus blossom,
where have I been all your life?
- Comment?...
- One of the natives.
Didn't I see you working your head off
in the Folies Bergères?
I'm sure I saw her in the Folies Bergères.
Oh, the lady's face is familiar, is it.
What would I be doing in the Folies Bergères
looking at faces?
Hey Maxwell, we don't have to
wake these two up.
- Besides, I can read her thoughts.
- Read her thoughts? Why Hugo that's clairvoyance!
Clairvoyance?
Oh good evening Claire!
Maxwell, we must be a riot.
First of tomorrow night's audience
just came in.
See what I mean
the dumb looking one.
Why Hugo, he doesn't look any more
dumb than I do.
Don't ask the impossible!
Hello stranger.
One of our American friends surprised speechless.
Well Mr Dumb Cluck, you as dumb as you look,
or do you cluck cluck cluck cluck cock-a-doodle doo?
Did you make me do that?
Why Hugo, I didn't do a thing.
Will someone please tell me
what's going on around here?
Hugo, I think we'd better be moving along.
He's a ventriloquist.
He doesn't look like a trick cyclist.
No no, I said ventriloquist.
What, you mean the chap who makes a voice
come out of a stuffed dummy?
- The way I do out of you?
- That's about it.
Well well well.
Is it true what he said?
- I guess so.
- You interest me my man. You interest me quite a lot.
We two could make beautiful music together.
That's fine, Hugo, but how about
making a little music with Frank, eh? Frank!
Maxwell, I don't think I feel like singing.
Come come Hugo.
Mustn't disappoint your public.
Just a bird in a gilded cage,
That's me!
Oh, to hell with it.
Oh come on now, are you ready?
One...
two, three.
Four, five, six.
Let's sit this one out, shall we?
Hugo, everybody's waiting!
My my, so they are.
Tell you what.
You be the canary tonight.
I'm going to talk to...
the ventriloquist man
Mind if I join you?
Sure, come on over!
Come on, sour puss!
Sit down.
- Now either of you gentlemen care for a glass of champagne?
- What do you think I am, a battleship?
Do you know something. I like you.
What's your name?
The name is Kee, Sylvester Kee.
- Sylvester, you may call me Hugo.
- Oh, thanks Hugo.
- That is my assistant.
- Oh, glad to know you, Mr Frere.
A very uncouth character I must admit.
Listen, how'd you like
to work with me?
I'd like it fine, Hugo, but...
- But what?
- Well how about Mr Frere?
You're sort of teamed up
with him, aren't you?
Him! My good man
think nothing of it.
I'm just about through
with that shoepad anyway.
Temper temper!
You'll be sorry for this later, you know.
Yes, I suppose I will.
Ladies and gentlemen, Hugo and I
are old friends.
Dear old pals.
Jolly old pals.
Exactly. But every now and then
we have our little disagreements.
You certainly disagree with me.
Would you believe it,
this guy thinks he carries the act.
Well, in one way,
maybe he does.
Come come, Hugo, we must be going.
Sure sure, but there won't be
much room in the dressing room.
Not much room in the dressing room.
Why not?
I told the waiter to bring up a couple of side-cars
and the fool bought the motorcycles as well.
Side-cars... motorcycles!
Well, goodnight ladies and gentlemen.
Bonsoir mesdames. Bonsoir messieurs.
- Say goodnight, Hugo.
- Goodnight, sleep tight, wake up sober.
Sylvester, I'll be waiting for you in my dressing room.
You and I have got to talk business.
- Which way to Maxwell Frere's dressing room?
- That door, monsieur.
- Who is it?
- It's Sylvester Kee
Come in.
Glad to see you, Sylvester.
Mix yourself a drink
and let's get down to business.
Well, thanks brother.
I will.
But suppose you tell me,
where I can find Mr Frere.
I guess, he can't be very far away.
Oh, so you won't talk, eh?
You want to see me?
Well, I rather thought I had an invite
from our young friend here.
After all, Mr Frere,
I'm a ventriloquist myself, you know.
Hell, I'm soaking.
- I have a clean towel in here.
- Thanks
Sorry, but I can't bear anyone touching him.
Oh, that's alright
Forget it.
Hey, I sure liked it
how you pulled that gag.
What gag?
I don't quite follow you.
The one I saw before you came in.
You know for a moment, I could have sworn
it was the dummy speaking. And me a pro.
What did he say?
Oh no, don't let's start that all over again
- About you and him?
- Yes, but you know that.
You wouldn't...
- ... You wouldn't be able to do that, would you?
- Do what? I don't get you.
Do what he was asking.
Say, are you nuts or something? How in heck
could I team up with Hugo? He's yours, isn't he?
Yes, that's right, he's mine.
What kind of heel, do you think I am anyway
that I'd try to steal another guy's act.
Now, please don't misunderstand me. I don't distrust you.
It's just that you don't know what Hugo is capable of.
Oh, I don't know about that,
I've had a pretty good demonstration.
Say, who runs this act anyway.
This fellow's almost human.
- Did you say 'almost'?
- That's right, as if you've got a mind of your own.
Maxwell, this fellow is as stupid
as you are.
- Perhaps, I better explain my position.
- No no no.
Kee, if you don't mind...
I'm rather tired.
Why sure, I understand.
Ignore him, Sylvester.
Just ignore him.
I'm the one who gives orders around here.
He's only...
- Hugo, please...
- Pipe down, you!
- Listen my friend...
- No no
Say what kind of a routine is this, anyway?
Go away will you.
Leave us alone.
Go away. Get out of here.
OK OK, I'm going.
You ought to get your head examined. Goodnight!
My friend, don't leave me!
Take me with you.
Maxwell, let go of me!
Kee, get me out of here.
Kee. Kee. Kee.
Hey, that guy there's nuts, huh?
But nuts!
After what happened in the dressing room
I was sure
he was not quite right in the head.
I did not see Frere again
until the night of February the 2nd.
I had just arrived in London,
and was staying at the Imperial Palace Hotel.
Shortly, before 11pm...
I entered the hotel bar.
Frere was sitting at the bar.
Hello there.
How have you been.
Hullo.
Oh, say, I met Joe Green just now.
He's mighty sore at you.
I expect he is.
We walked out of his show.
Oh, how come?
He didn't like it, and
I don't want to talk about it.
- Jack, same again.
- OK by me, brother.
Come on you two.
We only got 5 minutes.
Good evening, Jane.
What are you going to have Jo?
- Whiskey sour.
- Me too.
3 whiskey sours, Jack.
Oh look, there's Maxwell Frere...
- ... the ventriloquist!
- I've never seen him.
- Is that his dummy?
- Yes, Hugo. Isn't he quaint?
Oh, I'd just love to pick him up.
Oh, you can't miss.
The man's plastered.
You know very well
I mean the dummy.
You're awful!
- Go ahead then, why don't you?
- Go on, don't be shy.
Very well then.
Oh Mr Frere, I hope you wouldn't mind,
but he looks so cute.
I knew it, sister.
I knew it.
Aren't you a little devil!
Come along now.
Take your hands off me, will you,
or I'll punch your manky little face in,
Hey Maxwell, this cheap bit of skirt's getting after me.
You low filthy drunk you. I'll...
Did you here what this man called me?
Oh, skip it. Have a drink.
Harry Parker, are you going to stand by
and let this creature insult me.
Alright...
Look here, old man,
you'd better apologise to this lady.
What did you say?
I said you've insulted this lady,
and I said you'd better apologise to her.
I assure you,
I hadn't the slightest intention...
Lady? Ha ha. What lady?
Maxwell, I don't see no lady?
Look here, are you going to apologise, like a gentleman
or do I have to make you?
Who does this guy think he is?
Will you kick his teeth in, Maxwell, or shall I?
You asked for it.
Now then gentlemen
No fighting in here, please.
- Cut it out. Cut it out. The guy's faking.
- Oh, what's it got to do with you?
- I said cut it out. Go on scram
Alright, no need to get tough about it.
You alright, Frere?
- Hugo? - Come on girls.
Drink up and lets get out of here.
- Here he is.
- Thank you.
Well, it's my old friend Sylvester!
Ha ha, that's better.
- You shouldn't have done that you know.
- It's just one of those things.
- Are you staying in the hotel?
- Room 791
- We're all right.
- Sure you are. Sure you are.
I'm just going up to my room, and
I'll see you home. 791.
I said, it can't go on much longer.
He's doing it deliberately,
all this business with Joe Green...
- He's trying to ruin me.
- Oh, Joe wouldn't do a thing like that.
- He's sore, but...
- Joe?
You thought I meant...
That's good.
It's really funny.
No, I didn't mean Joe.
I don't get it.
Don't you?
No, I suppose you wouldn't.
You just think I'm drunk don't you?
- Well, you're not acting like you're on the water wagon.
- Smug, aren't you!
Well, you'd drink too
if you were in my shoes.
I tell you...
It's enough to drive a man mad.
Why don't you grab yourself some sleep?
What do you care whether I sleep or not.
- Well... - I'm not such a fool
as you think, Sylvester Kee.
I remember what happened in Paris.
I know what you were after.
You won't get away with it.
You're crazy.
Get out of this room.
Go on. Get out of this hotel, before I send
for the manager and get you thrown out.
Now, take it easy, pal.
It happens that I'm living in the hotel.
- Thrown out.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
Kee, smart you think, don't you?
I'll get even with you.
Be ready for you.
You won't get away with it.
Young fella, if my pal Fancy Pants, got me down
the way you do your boss.
Well, I guess I'd want to be rid of him.
Where is he?
Huh? Where's who?
What are you talking about?
Where is he?
You've stolen him.
If you're talking about the dummy,
I left him on your bed.
Now would you please go away
and let me sleep.
He's here.
I know he's here.
Hey, will you get the hell out of here
or do I have to throw you out.
- No. No. Wait
- Dirty thieving swine.
You dirty thieving swine.
What do you think of it?
Well, before I commit myself
I must talk to Frere again.
- Do you think you'll be able to get anything out of him?
- That, my friend, depends on you.
On me?
On your powers of persuasion
with the police, I should say.
As a matter of fact, I don't expect
to get what I want from Maxwell Frere.
Well, who do you expect to get it from?
If I am on the right lines,
from Hugo Fitch.
Hugo Fitch?
I knew you wouldn't leave me, Hugo.
- I knew you'd come back.
- Not for long, Maxwell, not for long.
You're going to stop in gaol
for years and years and years and years.
That wouldn't suit me.
But you... you'll tell them the truth
You will tell them it wasn't my fault.
What sort of dummy, do you think I am?
- You shot him, didn't you?
- Yes, but that was in self-defence.
- He was trying to rob me.
- Tell that to the judge.
Poor Sylvester!
Such a charming fellow.
They tell me he's recovering,
be out of hospital soon.
- What's that to you?
- Well, looks like I'll be needing a new partner.
Hugo!
You don't mean that. You're joking.
Like hell I am.
I've my career to think of.
You wouldn't run out on me now?
I don't believe it.
You wouldn't do that to me.
Oh, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I?
Hugo, I wouldn't let you.
Can't stop me, Maxwell.
You're finished. Finished.
But if I tell them the truth...
If I tell them you made me do it?
Try it and see what happens.
They'll put you in the madhouse!
But not little Hugo. Oh no.
I'm going to team up with Sylvester.
Maybe, we'll come and visit you.
You know,
private show for the looneys.
Now, Maxwell, don't get excited.
I was only joking.
You know me.
- Maxwell, leave me. Maxwell. You can't kill me.
- Stop Frere.
Frere, You fool.
Officer! Quickly!
Open this door!
Quickly.
I hope we're doing the right thing.
You know what happened the last time we met.
Maybe, he won't feel so good seeing me again.
It's our responsibility, Mr Kee.
- He's in here.
- Just a minute, doc.
I guess I got the jitters.
It'll give him a hell of a jolt, won't it?
That's just it. He needs a jolt
to set his brain working again.
You're the jolt. Of course, it's risky
but it's our only hope.
- Well I...
- We are ready to chance it, if you are.
- OK. You're the doctors.
- Thanks.
He's been like that all the time.
Frere,
there's someone to see you.
Hello there.
How are you keeping?
Say you remember me -
The name is Kee, Sylvester Kee.
Why, hello, Sylvester.
I've been waiting for you.
He's still there.
One of the most complete examples of dual identity
in the history of medical science.
You mean, that half the time Frere was Frere
and the other half he was his dummy.
Exactly.
And in the end
the dummy got the upper hand entirely.
Yes, but how did the dummy get from
one room to another? Under its own steam?
Without knowing what he was doing,
Frere took it himself.
Impelled by the dominating
Hugo half of his mind.
That is the scientific explanation.
But no doubt, you people
would prefer a more colourful one...
- ... that Hugo had become endowed with an
existence of his own. - Drink?
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
Blimey, George is dying on us.
It's started.
It's alright. Nothing's started.
No one's died.
- George isn't a man. It's Foley's power plant.
- They make their own electricity.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're your friends.
- We want to help you.
- None of you can help me.
I must be left alone with Dr van Straaten.
Please.
Perhaps it's best.
And Grainger, would you be kind enough to fetch my
spare glasses from my room. I'm lost without them.
Yes. OK doctor.
And now Craig
I accept your dream.
Now my part is to listen
and your's to talk.
Just let your thoughts well out.
Speak them aloud.
Say everything that is in your mind.
I should have left here
when I wanted to...
when I still had a will of my own.
You tried to stop me.
You wouldn't have done if you had known.
You have not told me yet what
it is that you are compelled to do, Craig.
To kill someone,
someone who's never done me any harm.
Who wishes me nothing but good.
A man without defence.
Because, he's lost in the dark.
Oh Doctor... why did you have
to break your glasses.
Got to hide.
Hide.
- Let's play another game.
- Yes, hide and seek.
- Who's to hide?
- I'll hide! I'll hide!
Mr Craig's to hide!
Mr Craig's to hide!
- Peter
- Something gone wrong with your plan?
- Please, Peter, Let me hide in the room in the mirror.
- Room in the mirror?
Jimmy, I've found him!
Here he is up at the top.
Up at the top.
Take a seat, Mister.
- One side is better
- He looks kind of sick to me, Hugo.
- Well, why don't he see a doctor.
- Maybe, he has seen a doctor.
My my Hugo. We've never played
to a murderer before, have we.
Why no, Kee.
Is there a policeman in the house?
Just room for one more inside, sir.
Wouldn't I?
Darling, whatever's the matter?
- Another nightmare.
- You poor sweet.
Hello. Oh just a minute.
Darling.
Walter Craig speaking.
Darling, you're on my feet.
Oh. Bill put you on to me.
That's fine.
What name is it?
Eliot Foley.
F- O-L-E-Y
Yes and the place is Pilgrim's Farm.
- Who was it? - A friend of Bill's. Wants me to go down
for the weekend. A reconstruction job. An old farmhouse in Kent.
Eliot Foley. Pilgrim's Farm.
I wonder why that sounds so familiar.
A weekend in the country.
I should go.
Mm. I'll toss for it.
Heads I go. Tails I don't
Heads.
I go.
That's just what you need darling
It'll help you get rid of those horrible nightmares.
