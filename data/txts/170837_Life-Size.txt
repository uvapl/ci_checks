Here's Eve at the
Sand and Sea Club.
Let's catch a wave!
Press the button on Eve's
back and she talks to you.
Remember, don't
pollute our oceans.
Watch Eve drive her Fun and
Sun convertible to the mall
and see what this lady can do.
Shine bright, shine far
Be a star
Where you live, where
you are Be a star!
It's fun to dress
up. I look awesome.
Love animals, don't wear them.
Now Eve's ready to
come home to Sunnyvale,
where the sun always shines.
Then pick a career for
Eve. She does it all.
Take Eve home and watch her sparkle
and shine. Like the song says...
Be a star!
I'm Eve and you're
my special friend.

How about one of those?
No way. I don't want a doll. I
want something with microchips.
I don't get it, Sam.
Used to be we couldn't
keep dolls on the shelf.
Now all those kids want is
hi-tech this, hi-tech that.
Here we go!
You dropped the ball again!
-You throw like a girl!
Hey, break it up!
Stewart, off the field now.
You, too, Weiner.
Go play with your dolls,
Caseoid. -Get a life, Weiner-head.
I hate dolls as
much as I hate you.
Casey, this
behaviour has to stop.
It's a game, remember?
Three o'clock? Oh, no!
I missed Casey's game again.
I'm going for a
perfect record.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
She knows you love
her, that's what counts.
Remember the Sundays you spent
teaching Casey to pass a football
when you could've been
with me watching the NFL.
Well, that was a while
ago. Things have changed.
Well, come have some lunch
with us. We'll cheer you up.
No, thanks. I'm
gonna eat here.
Ben, trying to make
partner is one thing,
but you are working too hard.
What if I cook a fabulous dinner
tomorrow night for you and Casey?
I guarantee it'll
be tofu free.
It's Casey's birthday and I promised
we'd have dinner, just me and her.
That's so sweet. See,
you are a great dad.
OK. Well, give Casey a
big birthday kiss for me.
I will. -I'll see
you down there.
You are in there, buddy.
She's only been here six months,
already she wants to cook for you.
Richie... Drew's great.
I'm just not ready, OK?
You've been saying
that two years.
You need to loosen up,
have some fun again.
Karen would've
wanted you to move on.
For you and for Casey.

Looks like we're
both working late.
What are you doing?
Oh, nothing. Just surfing.
Good night.
I should've been
there. I'm sorry.
You wore out sorry
a long time ago.
Did you win?
We're in the
championships Wednesday.
Congratulations.
I know, you promise
to be there, right?
Casey, I realise... this
is hard to understand,
but making partner means
a lot to me. And to us.
I understand. I'm not
a little kid any more.
I know you're not.
Tomorrow's our
special dinner, right?
How about Sunday you and I
spend the whole day together?
Just you and me
for your birthday.
OK? -Sure, Dad.
Dad?
Does everything
happen for a reason?
Sometimes...
...things just
happen, sweetheart.
Good night.
Good night, Dad.
Did you check out the
new shoes at the mall?
Yeah, they're great.
-They're so cool.
Don't look now, but
here comes the loner.
That's not very nice.
Ever since her mom died,
she's totally ignored us.
Yeah, like, get
over it already.
Casey!
We're going to the
mall. Wanna come?
No, thanks.
How come you never wanna
hang out with us any more?
Sarah, there's more to
life than just shopping.
Alright. You can have it by?
OK, that's great.

63.
Great! I'll never
see her again.

I hope all your wishes
come true, sweetie.
This is your favourite.
Double chocolate.
Chocolate on the outside
and chocolate on the inside.
Look at that.
Dad, you know what
I wished for? -What?
That Mom could
somehow come back.
Casey... -Maybe
it can really work.
I thought we already
discussed this.
No more of that junk.
Look, I wish that
there was magic, too,
but life doesn't
work that way.
Remember what Dr Jacobs
said about accepting reality?
He's a quack and has bad
breath. What does he know?
How to help unhappy
people be happy again.
So, I don't want to talk
about that stuff, OK?
You never want
to talk about Mom.
You know what I
found yesterday?
Super Bowl tickets.
You remember? Green
Bay versus New England.
Everyone in the stands
was on their feet.
Mom was cheering so
hard she couldn't talk.
Remember that guy behind us
kept yelling, "Down in front!"
I never took you off
my shoulders, did I?
No.
We had a great
time, didn't we?
Yeah.
Hi. I am sorry to barge
in on you and Casey,
but you forgot the depo
questions yesterday.
You were gonna review
my draft. -Oh, right.
Phil needs it on his
desk Monday morning.
No problem. I can do it
right now. Come on in.
Hey, sweetie. Happy birthday.
I couldn't help myself.
Now don't kill me.
Oh, what do you know? A doll!
But not just any doll. May I?
This is a very special doll.
This is Eve. She has a very
sophisticated look, don't you think?
Let's go to the mall.
You're my special friend.
What's great is she's
numbered, like a work of art.
She's a collector's item.
Look, it says "complete with
certificate of authenticity inside".
How about that?
Yeah, she's a real
piece of... -Art.
I know you're too old for dolls. I
collected them when I was your age.
Thanks, Drew. I'll put her
in someplace real special.
Guess it wasn't such a great
idea. -Oh, come on, she loved it.

Casey, are you still up?
Come in.
Hi. I just wanted
to say good night.
Good night.
What a great room!
Look at all the
trophies you have, Casey.
No!
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me help
you. -No! Don't touch anything!
Now I've got to clean
all this stuff up.
I'm sorry, Casey.
Look at you.
That's better.
What are you doing?
That's my stuff.
I'm sorry.
Well, I hope you
had a nice birthday.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.

Mom.
You better watch it, lady,
I hit 20 homers last season.
Wait a minute. You can't be.
I'm Eve. And you're
my special friend.
What happened?
My ankles bend.
I can move. -This
isn't happening.
I must be dreaming.
This isn't happening.
Who are you?
Where am I?
Oh, no! What have I done?
What happened to my purse?
This is a disaster. That was my
only chance to bring her back.
Bring who back?
My mom. You're alive, not her.
I'm alive?
I am?
That's it. I'm alive.
Why do I feel like I'm
in a bad horror movie?
Reversing spells.

setting sun of the fourth day."
"To reverse spells see Volume
II, The Book of Awakenings."
Volume II?
Case? You up?
-Dad, wait a second.
I'm getting
dressed. -Who's that?
What?
Nothing.
We're spending
the day together.
We don't have to. You're
probably really busy.
No, it's no problem. I'm going to
the store. Do you want anything?
How about a banana
split? -What?
What?
I said just split. I don't
need anything. Take your time.
I am so dead now.
If Dad finds out what happened,
he'll send me back to that shrink.
Music! -No! Will
you turn that off?
Oh, my gosh, the pictures
move. This is super fantastic!
It's just like Sunnyvale,
except everything works.
Where are my clothes?
My accessory sets?
My fashion trunk?
You don't have any
clothes or accessory sets.
Of course I do. Eve never
goes anywhere without them.
You don't get it. This is all a big
mistake and I'm turning you back.
Back? You can't do that.
Watch me. We're going
to that bookstore
and once I get Volume
II, you're plastic.
Everything is so
big and so bright.
Look out. Coming
through. -And fast.
Wait.
What's that funny feeling?
-What are you talking about?
What?
What are you doing?
Roses. I can smell!
What are those?
This world smells so good.
Maybe not the whole
world. -Come on.
Excuse me. This is everyone's
home. Please keep it clean.
Garbage police. Unbelievable.
Littering is wrong. The man learned
a very valuable lesson today.
Let's go.
Case, I'm back!
Case?
Casey, slow down.
If word is I'm stuck with you
forever, we're getting that book now.
Now go inside and ask for
Holcroft's Books of the Dead,
Volume II, The
Book of Awakenings.
I've got to stay out here.
Book of Awakenings? That doesn't
sound like a bedtime story.
It is for you.
Can I help you?
Is this Volume II,
The Book of Awakenings?
I never got that one. I had
Volume I until yesterday.
A young girl took it.
-I know who that is.
She's right there.
Hey, you're the one who...
Hey, stop!
Casey, wait for me! -Stop
her! Call the police!
Hey! -Sorry!
Casey?
Casey!
Are you alright?
Casey, are you OK?
Why did you run in front
of that truck, honey?
I almost had a heart
attack. -I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?
I was returning that
book I found in your room.
You and I are going to have a
serious talk about that, young lady.
Thank you. You saved
my daughter's life.
It was nothing. I've
been a police officer.
I'm Ben Stewart.
What's your name?
Eve.
This is my daughter Casey.
Ben. What a nice name.
Such a nice man, too.
Are all the men here
as handsome as you are?
Casey!
Casey?
Can you hear me?
Casey?
Dad? What happened?
You fainted.
Oh, wow.
I had the worst nightmare.
There was this doll and
she came to life and she...
Hi, Casey.
Take it easy. Everything's OK.
This'll make you
sparkle and shine.
This is Eve. She's the
one who stopped that truck.
If it weren't for her,
you might not be alive.
How ironic.
She came home with us
to make sure you're OK.
She's had medical training.
Are you OK?
Yeah. I'm just having a hard
time swallowing all of this.
Well, thank you again. I don't
know how we can repay you.
Oh, it was nothing really.
After Casey rests a bit,
can we drive you somewhere?
Let's go to the mall.
I just love this car. I've got an
orange one but you have to push it.
Yeah, I had one of those.
Triple A cancelled me.
What are all these buttons
for? -Don't touch them!
Stop!
Wow. What does this one do?
Wow. This is so great.
This is nice. I haven't
had the top down in ages.
This is so much fun! -Eve?
You should probably
put your seat belt on.
You're right. Safety first.
Hi. -Mom.
Everything is so
beautiful here.
Even the people.
Sometimes it's hard to tell
what's real from what's plastic.
It's all plastic
where I come from.
Where's that? -Sunnyvale.
Sunnyvale? I don't know it.
How long have you been here?
Oh, I just arrived. It was a sort
of spur-of-the-moment decision.
And how long you staying?
I don't know. I don't even
know where I'm staying.
My clothes and accessories
haven't arrived yet,
but I'm sure they
will really soon.
Don't count on it.
I guess they don't have
escalators in Sunnyvale, do they?
Oh, it's perfect.
It's just what I need.
But my credit card's
with the rest of my stuff.
I don't mean to be forward, but why
don't you let me loan you some money
and you can pay me back
when your things arrive.
Dad! -Oh, Ben,
you're so awesome.
Thank you so much.
And as far as a
place to stay goes...
Wait! You're not... -We
do have a guesthouse.
You're welcome to use it until you
figure out what you're gonna do.
Really? Thank you so much.
You can't. That's
Mom's old studio.
Hold on. Hello? -What
are you trying to do?
I've gotta stay somewhere.
-Go find a dollhouse.
But then I can't stay
with my special friends.
We'll have to
reschedule. -Dad, come on.
I'll be right in.
Excuse me. You should love
animals, not wear them.
Casey! -Finally.
Isn't this so much fun? Us
girls doing what we do best.
Us girls? Since when did I
become your shopping buddy?
You look so cool. -I wouldn't
wear it if you paid me.
You're really starting to bug
me. Remind me to thank Drew later.
Who's Drew? -She
works with my dad.
She gave you to
me for my birthday.
That's one gift I
should've never opened.
Look at that over there.
OK, dress me.
That does it. I'm out of here.
But, Casey...
...Eve's never
dressed herself before.
I can't read this.
I know. Everything's
in Italian.
The only thing they translate are
the prices, but everything's good.
I can order for
you, if you like?
Hi, Antonio. Eve and I
are gonna have the special.
And Case? Spaghetti?
OK.
Wow! Real food! -Exactly.
That's what I love about this place.
None of that hip, trendy stuff.
This is fabulous.
Well, they do have good bread
here. Would you like some butter?
Can't wait till you
try the linguini.
So I guess Sunnyvale isn't exactly
the restaurant capital of the world?
Where is it again?
-Yeah, I'm dying to know.
It's a perfect little town, right
smack dab in the middle of America,
where the sun always shines.
And what do you do there?
-I do all kinds of things.
Law enforcement,
medicine, office work.
You do all that? Wow. I can't
even find a good secretary.
I just fired my last one.
The fourth this month.
I'm a great secretary. I type and
I file and I work with computers.
It's a must these
days. -Really?
Do you know Apple or Windows?
Both. I love apples.
I don't know if you'd be interested,
but I could use some help tomorrow.
But, Dad, she can't.
-Of course I'll help.
Great.
You know, Ben, even
though I do so many things,
my real purpose in
life is to help girls.
I strive to present a
positive image of womanhood.
I believe girls should know
that all things are possible.
My wife believed that.
Were you ever married?
No. And it's too bad,
cos I look awesome
in a wedding dress.
The men back home are so
good-looking, but they're so stiff.
You are the most interesting
man that I have ever met.
You have definitely
got to get out more.
Dad, don't you
have any work to do?
Nope. I'm yours for the day.
Would you excuse me for a
minute? I'll be right back.
Your dad is so much cuter than
those guys back in Sunnyvale.
You stay away from him.
Got that? -Why? He likes me.
He can't like
you. You're a doll.
Not any more.

you really want?
Coming up next,
indulge yourself with the finest

Sit back, relax, select
anything your heart desires.
Dad?
Yeah, Case?
I've gotta tell you something,
but you probably won't believe me.
Pretty weak for an opening
argument, Counsellor.
Remember that book?
Well, it had a spell,
I used it and it worked.
What do you mean, "it worked"?
I tried to bring Mom back to life.
The spell worked, but not on Mom.
That doll that Drew gave me,
I brought it to life instead.
Dad, Eve's really a doll.
Casey...
I knew you
wouldn't believe me.
Everything she
told you is a lie.
You've never
heard of Sunnyvale.
I haven't heard
of a lot of towns.
You don't think it's weird that
she even looks like the doll
and has the same name? -A
lot of women have that name.
And, I will admit, that at
times, she can be rather... odd.
But there's something
very sweet about her.
I'm telling the truth.
Why won't you believe me?
You're asking me to believe
that a doll can come to life?
But it's true. I'll prove it.

Hi, Ellen. This is Eve.
She's temping for me today.
Hi.
What agency are you with?
-She's from out of town.
So if you could help her get
situated here and send her on back?
OK.
I need some information
for our employee database.
Last name? -I don't have one.
Address?
1 Maple Lane, Sunnyvale.
Sunnyvale. What
state's that in?
The Sunshine State.
Oh, Florida.
Your previous position?
Sitting?
I meant, where
was your last job?
Oh. I was helping out
with the space shuttle.
Finally, someone who
knows what they're doing.
Ben, I am all set.
Hello? -That was the fax.
I know, every
office is different.
The fax is here, the
phone has its own headset,
and the computer's linked
up to all the other stations.
This is so much fun.
I just need you to do these letters.
Enter 'em in the letters file.
Any questions, I'm
right in there. -OK.
Well, well. Hello there.
Need any help?
No. Eve can handle anything.
Yeah. May I? I'm not
sure Ben wanted that.
There. Better be on the safe side.
Starting a new job can be rough.
Yes. It's very important to make a
good impression on your first day.
Yes, it is. I'm Richard
Ackerman. And you are?
Eve. I'm a star.
"Star light, star bright.
Wish I may, wish I might."
You know, I've
got a few minutes.
If you want, I could give
you some computer tips.
Really? Eve never
says no to learning.
Eve, could I see you in
here for a minute, please?
In there?
Eve? -That is funny.
The talk button's on the left.
Richie, this is Eve.
Richie? -What?
This is Eve, who's
staying in the guesthouse.
Oh, so you're the one.
Eve, could you meet me
in my office, please?
Sure.
I guess I'll take a rain
check on that lesson.
OK. I'll wear my
razzle-dazzle raincoat.
I can't wait. -Yeah.
Yes! Man, you really took my
"move on" suggestion to her.
I don't know what you're thinking,
but there's nothing going on.
Really? Even better.
So if I wanted to ask her out
to the firm party tonight...
Richie, I'm not dating her.
If you wanna ask her,
she's gonna be here all day.
You the man, Ben. You the man!
Eve, I've got some
filing for you.
What's wrong? -I did
something to my neck.
I can fix that
for you. -Oh, no.
It's really fine. I don't...
Yeah.
Don't tell me you
used to be a masseuse.
A massage therapist.
I don't know if the workplace
is the place for this kind of...
Sit back. Relax.
Ben?
Hey, Drew. -Hi.
It's 10.30. Did you want
me to... -No, it's fine.
Drew McDonald, Eve. Eve, Drew.
Eve's temping for me today.
So you're Drew. It's
so nice to meet you.
You look awfully familiar.
Have we met at the sports club?
Yoga class? -No.
I got it, law school.
Eve's actually
from out of town.
It's quite a story. I'll tell
you later. Eve, I've gotta run.
I'm gonna have Ellen
show you what to do.
And... Are you sure
you're OK with all of this?
Ben, don't worry. I'll
take care of everything.
Great. Thanks.
Eve can handle anything!
Recycling saves our planet.
And exactly which
planet is that?
My nail!
I broke it!
You're not gonna
throw me away, are you?
Sit.
Francine?
Could you please call
a cab for our Miss Eve?
I don't understand.
Where I come from, I am
the perfect secretary.
Eve never fails.
Look, honey, we can't
all succeed at everything.
We each have our own talent.
I mean, if I looked
half as good as you...
I can't get this one guy at
the office to even look at me.
What?
All you need is
a touch of base.
You've got lovely skin.
Just a hint of this blush to
bring out that natural colour.
Let's take a look.
You've made a new
woman out of me.
Cab's here.
Ellen, is that you?
Francine, there's someone
I want you to meet.
Hi.
Can I help you?
I got one of those Eve dolls and
it came with this certificate.
What's it for?
That guarantees that you
have an authentic Eve doll.
Each doll has
its own number...
...stamped on
the certificate...
...as well as right here.
You mean every doll has this?
Yep. It never comes off.
It's your way of proving you've
got the genuine article. A real Eve.
I got you now, Miss
Sparkle And Shine.
Hey, Casey. Do you like
my firecracker-red nails?
What are you doing?
-Getting the proof I need.
Exhibit A. Once my dad
sees this, it's adiós.
We don't have to show him now,
at least not until after tonight.
What's tonight? -I'm
going to your dad's party.
That nice man Richard invited me.
-What? You can't go to a party.
Why not? It's what I do.
Besides, can't a girl
have a bit of fun?
You don't know when
to quit, do you?
Just cos you're gorgeous doesn't
mean you get what you want.
Your days are
numbered. Literally.
Fancy meeting you here. -Hey,
Drew. Wow. You look great.
Thank you.
Richard doesn't waste
any time. -No, he doesn't.
I hope her self-defence skills are
better than her secretarial skills.
I heard she really did
a number on the office.
Yeah, I know. But for some
reason, Ellen was raving about her.
Wow.
This is so much more exciting than
Eve's Grand Ball back in Sunnyvale.
They sure know how to
make 'em in Sunnyvale.
Who, me? I wasn't made there.
No? Where? -Indonesia.
But I was packaged locally.
Care for some punch?
Good.
You are wild.
Richie!
Oh. No. It's Mr
and Mrs Boring.
How've you been? Still billing
people you talk to at parties?
I'll make an exception in your
case. John, Susan, this is Eve.
Nice to meet you, Mr Boring.
Mrs Boring.
So, Eve, are you a lawyer?
I have been.
And what do you do now? -Depends
on what outfit I'm wearing.
If I didn't know better, I'd swear
you were mentally dictating a brief.
Sorry.
We can all make this
world a better place.
Eve cares about poverty
and world hunger.
That's why I'm the perfect
role model for girls.
Why'd they leave?
Everybody loves Eve.
You are brilliant.
You got rid of them.
Hey. -Hi.
Hey, guys. -Hi, Ben.
Eve. You having fun?
You gotta dance with me.
Richie, do you
mind? -No, go ahead.
Come on.
Relax.
I'm the best ballroom
dancer in Sunnyvale.
Listen to the music.
That's it.
Wow. -See? You've got it.
How can a girl
compete with that?
Yeah, she's something,
isn't she? Indonesians.
How do you do it? -Do what?
Every time I'm with you, I forget all
about work and pressure and clients.
You think about those things
too much. Life should be fun.
You really believe it's
that simple, don't you?
Time's up, pal.
Richie.
Where did you learn
to dance like that?
Ben is such a nice guy.
Too nice.
If you were staying at my
house, I'd never let you out.
And you're in terrific shape.
How do you do so many
things and still work out?
Fitness is very important. Do
you know I'm anatomically correct?
It's my favourite type.
Why don't we get out of here?
Away from all this
noise. Just you and me.
Isn't that what you want?
What was that for?
Wasn't I supposed to do
that? You were being forward.
No, I wasn't.
I...
You're right. I deserved that.
I am sorry for
acting this way.
Richie, you don't
have to act at all.
Women will love you
for just being yourself.
Look at you, you're
friendly and you're funny.
And you're really handsome.
Really? You think so?
Yes.
Wow.
That's the nicest, most honest
thing a woman's ever said to me.
Ladies and gentlemen, the
band will now take requests.
If there's anything
you'd like, we'll play it.
It's OK? -Sure.
Do you know Be A Star? -No.
But if you sing it, I'm
sure we can follow you.
Eve's great no
matter where she goes
Dress her up from
her head to her toes
On the town, at the mall,
Eve loves high fashion
After dark, at the club, she'll
spend the whole night dancing
Shine bright, shine far
Don't be shy, be a star
Where you live, where
you are Be a star!
Shine bright, shine far
Be a star
Where you live, where
you are Be a star...
Come on, everybody, you can
all be stars! Let's dance!
Eve wants the world
and she does it right
She takes a stand
Eve shines so bright
Now get all of your friends...
Do you have any idea
who she's dancing with?
No. -Judge Peterman,
10th circuit.
His briefs will never
be the same again.
Be a star...
Put your hands together!
Shine bright, shine far
Don't be shy, be a star
Where you live, where
you are Be a star!
Shine bright, shine far
Be a star
Where you live, where
you are Be a star!
Stardust and moonlight...
Ellen?
Believe me, this isn't
a line or anything,
but you really look
very beautiful tonight.
Would you... care to dance?
Oh, yeah.
Shine bright, shine far
Where you live, where you are
Be a star
Shine bright, shine far
Be a star
Where you live, where
you are Be a star!
Get all of your friends
and let's get together
We can make a change
that'll last forever
It's all about love...
Did you see that
big lady dancing?
This is a night I'll never
forget. -Neither will anyone else.
I wonder who's asleep,
Casey or the baby-sitter?
Dad?
How's the guesthouse? -It's
perfect. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Oh, Ben, look. Real stars.
They look so far away.
Yeah.
There's Pleiades,
the Seven Sisters.
See those bright ones there?
That's Perseus. -Wow.
They all have names.
They're so beautiful.
Wow, Ben, look at the moon.
I never knew it
could be so romantic.
I had a great time
tonight. What about you?
I never knew you could have that
much fun in a room full of lawyers.
There's only one thing missing
to make it a perfect evening.
Dad.
How could you?
Casey... your eyes.
They're wet.
Casey, wait.
Casey!
Case?
Go away!
Nothing happened, Casey.
She was trying to kiss you so that
you would fall in love with her!
I'm not falling in
love with anyone, honey.
You let her stay in
Mom's special place, Dad.
Sweetie...
Nothing I do is gonna make a
difference. Everything is ruined.
Case?
Just go away. I hate you.
Run!
Go!
That's OK. Keep your
eye on the ball, OK?
You dropped it again, Weiner-head!
-That's it. You're benched.
No. I've gotta practise. The
championship game is tomorrow.
You should've thought
about that before.
Aren't sports fun?
They keep you fit.
What do you want? If you want
Dad, you've got the wrong place.
He doesn't come
any more. -Really?
But I came to see you.
Casey, last night... you
had water in your eyes.
And it ran down your
cheeks. -It's called crying.
You really don't
get it, do you?
When people are sad, it
makes tears in their eyes.
Where do the tears come from?
In here.
But why were you so sad?
Being human is so much fun.
You don't know
about being human.
Of course I do. It's so easy.
That's what you think.
You're always happy.
Well, real life's not perfect.
You've never been hurt.
You've never loved someone so
much and then, all of a sudden,
they're gone, for ever.
Your mom?
She was fine. I mean, she
just went in for a checkup.
Then they found something.
Before I knew it she was gone.
Just like that.
Nothing was ever the same.
You know what? Maybe I don't
know that much about being human.
But I do know one thing.
Casey, what happened
to you was not fair.
Every girl deserves
to have her mother.
And nobody can ever,
ever replace her for you.
You know what? I
got a great idea.
The perfect thing
for a time like this.
Meet me back at the house, OK?
Well, that's everything.
I'd say we're ready.
You nail this deposition
and you've nailed the case.
And the partnership.
-That's the plan.
Was there something else?
Well, actually...
Ben, Ellen showed me Eve's
employment application.
Have you seen it? I think you
might find this interesting.
Last three jobs. NASA
payload specialist,
policewoman, Sunnyvale PD,
and doctor, Sunnyvale Hospital.
She definitely has
a vivid imagination.
Ben, I'm serious. There's
something strange about her.
I'm worried she's
up to something.
I admit she's a bit different,
but I think she's harmless.
Maybe I'm just being jealous.
Just keep an eye on her. I don't
want to see you or Casey get hurt.
Drew?
Yeah?
It's nice to know
you're jealous.
Where's Eve's magic cookbook?
It's got blue
stars on the cover.
Blue stars?
Not here.
Well... I'll just improvise.
Casey, help me!
Please, help me!
What have you done?
Casey!
Let me do it! I
was a forest ranger!
Out the way!
Casey, get it!
I'm so stupid!
So much for vanilla surprise.
Some surprise. You could've
burnt the house down!
Nothing I do is right. I
can't type and I can't cook.
I'm supposed to be such a
good role model. Look at me!
I need my Fun 'n'
Splash hot tub!
Go ahead and laugh.
Look at me, I'm a wreck.
Look at your face.
Look at yours.
Wow, look at
those pretty eyes.
They're not that great.
Oh, yes, they are.
They're amazing.
You know, Casey, you're
a really pretty girl.
And there is nothing wrong
with showing that sometimes.
You've got lovely eyes
and a really sweet smile.
Dad used to call it
my 100-watt smile.
I guess it got
short-circuited.
I wish I could
help bring it back.
Casey, I have a
confession to make.
I've hardly helped
any girls yet.
No one wants to buy me any
more. What's wrong with me?
First, you're already beautiful,
so lose the sparkle and shine stuff.
That went out with disco. And
look at all the things you do.
You're a classic overachiever.
Nobody's this good at everything.
But I'm supposed to
always be perfect.
Do you realise how
hard it is to be me?
It is not easy being the
best at so many things.
Part of being human
is making mistakes.
But I'm a doll. Dolls are
supposed to be perfect.
Perfect is boring.
My mom taught me that it's
not about being the best,
it's about trying your best.
Being a role model doesn't mean
I have to be perfect all the time.
You got it.
But what about you, though?
Seems to me you've
just given up trying.
Don't tell me you've
been a psychiatrist?
See, there you go again.
Always pushing people away.
I can't help it.
Everything's different
and nobody understands.
But you gotta give
people a chance.
Your mom would want
you to be happy,
to be with your
friends and have fun.
Casey, you have
so much to offer.
So much inside of you.
You just gotta let it out.
You think so?
I know so.
Eve, you're OK.
Come here.
Casey, I had so much fun tonight.
-We did have fun, didn't we?
I haven't laughed
like that in so long.
You know what? You really
are my special friend.
I don't mean to interrupt, but
it's way past somebody's bedtime.
Good night, Dad. -Good
night, sweetheart.
Good night, Eve. -Come
on, let's get you to bed.
Good night. -Good night.
That was nice.
I think Casey's
starting to like you.
I haven't seen her smile that
much in... I don't know how long.
Well, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to bed.
Ben?
I went to Casey's practice today.
She's so good. You should see her.
She is amazing, isn't she?
I used to go all the
time but, I don't know...
...work just
keeps interfering.
I'm sure when things slow
down, you'll be at every game.
Cos you're her
biggest fan, right?
Right.
Good night, Ben.
-Good night, Eve.
Hey! Big game today.
I'll be there, I promise.
So don't let 'em
start without me, OK?
Sure, Dad.
"Holcroft's Book of the
Dead, Volume II, has arrived."
"Call Past Pages Bookstore."
...will go into effect
at the end of this year.
And in financial news,
Marathon Toys announced more
disappointing sales figures for Eve.
Reflecting the downward trend
in sales of all fashion dolls,
Eve's performance has
continued to slide.
That's my car!
That's my mall!
The company has begun
pulling back the line.
A decision on whether to cancel
the doll will come in two weeks.
No, they can't!
Home.
The sun may finally be
setting on Sunnyvale.
Come back!
Guess what?
The used bookstore
just got Volume II.
What? -Today's
the fourth day.
By sunset this will
become permanent.
Permanent? -You'll
never be a doll again.
It's official.
You're here to stay.
Guess we won't be
needing that book.
I mean, I could never send you
back. You're part of the family.
But I just saw on the TV...
There's my ride. I'll
see you at the game.
Casey, wait!
Here they are, the
Notre Dame Knights.
And the home team,
Windsor Wildcats!
Stretch 'em out.
This is it.
Ladies and gentlemen, the
championship game is about to begin.
Where are they? We were supposed
to be done half an hour ago.
They're trying
to sweat us out.
Relax guys. -This is a
breach of the deposition.
The court reporters should
sign the certificate.
They'll be here.
This is grounds to postpone the
trial. What do you think, Ben?
Ben?
What?
You guys are more than
prepared to handle this.
Ben, where are you going?
-I'm going to a football game.
How's Casey gonna win
without her biggest fan?
Yes!
Ben, where are you going? They
called. They're on their way.
Phil, 10 minutes ago the
Super Bowl of 7th grade started
and Casey's the quarterback.
I haven't been to a game all year,
I'm not about to miss her last one.
Ben? -I've never
let you down before.
And if this jeopardises my
chances for partnership, so be it,
but I've already lost
someone very close to me.
And I'm not about to
let that happen again.
Here we go.
Home team quarterback, Casey
Stewart, with an 8-yard run.
First down, Wildcats,
with 5:09 remaining
in the first quarter.
Come on, Wildcats!
Come on, Bruce,
kill 'em for me!
That's my son.
Ben? -How's it
going, Phyllis?
Where have you been?
I gave up on you.
Yes. Somebody else did, too.
Go, Casey!
That's my daughter.
Second down and 6 yards
to go on the 45-yard line.
The home team trails by 4 points
with 12 seconds left in the game.
Let's go!
Let's go, Cats!
Hey, Eve. You made
it. -So did you.
I have you to thank for that.
Let's go, kids!
Ben, I came to
say goodbye. -What?
I came to say goodbye.
-The game's almost over.
Tell me at the end.
Ready?
Come on, Casey!
One more, Case!
That's all we need!
Blue 42!
Ready. Set.
I'm open!
Yes!
Go, Weiner! Go!
The referee has
signalled no touchdown.
Oh, my God.
The final score
of today's game,
the new city champions
Notre Dame Knights, 14,
the Windsor Wildcats, 10.
What happened? -They lost.
I'll be right back.
That was the best
pass I've ever seen.
Oh, Daddy.
I am so proud of you.
Win or lose, you were
great out there today.
I'm so sorry I haven't
been there for you.
I could never tell you.
It just hurt too much.
All the things we
used to do together,
you, your mom and I.
She would be so proud of you.
I miss her so much.
I know.
I miss her, too, sweetheart.
That's a 50-watter. You
wanna go for a hundred?
I know it's heartbreaking
cos it was so close,
but you played a great
game. You did. It was great.
Hey, Casey.
Nice pass. -For a girl?
For anyone.
Thanks, Weiner. Thanks, Bruce.
Where's Eve? -You mean
that nice-looking woman?
She just left. Asked
me to tell you goodbye.
What?
She said she found a book
and she's headed home.
To Sunnyvale?
Oh, no. She's going back.
But why? I don't get it.
-What are you talking about?
No time to explain.
We've gotta stop her.
We're going to Sunnyvale.
I thought Sunnyvale
was in middle America?
More like the
middle of downtown.
What's going on? -Eve's
about to have a meltdown.
Sir, I'm home.
You're late. Follow
the footsteps.
"Sun of suns, moon of moons,
once awakened, now to return."
Here it is. The sun sets at
6:01 pm, so we have to hurry.
Casey, do you wanna
let me in on this?
Bye-bye.
Did someone who looks like
the Eve doll come in here?
You mean the woman
from the photoshoots?
She came in to pick
up her last pay cheque.
I sent her to payroll.
Follow the footsteps.
Payroll.
It's locked.
Eve's backpack.
Oh, no. We'll never find her.
Casey?
We made it in time.
It's not too late.
Oh, Casey, it is.
The spell's complete.
I don't have much
time. -No, you can't go.
Why are you
doing this? -Wait.
It's not possible. Right?
You can't really be a...
I'm going home now.
It's where I belong.
They're about to cancel the doll.
They need me back in Sunnyvale.
But we need you, too.
You can't just leave us.
We love you.
And I love you both.
You have taught me so much.
I know I've helped
one little girl.
Hopefully there'll
be many more to come.
This is where I belong.
It's my home.
I know I wasn't doing such
a good job there before.
But, thanks to
you, now I know why.
I can go back now.
And everything you taught me
will be a part of all the dolls.
But if I don't go, there
won't be any more Eve.
This is unbelievable. I
don't know... what to say.
Except thank you.
I'll never forget you.
Bye, Casey. -Bye, Eve.
Look for me in Sunnyvale.
How about we put her
someplace real special?
OK?
Hey, look at that.
Wow.
Hey, Sarah, wait up.
Dad, can I go?
-Yeah, go ahead.
Hi, Casey. Your hair
looks great. -Thanks.
I was gonna go pick up
some CDs. You wanna come?
You're not too
busy? -Not any more.
Great. Let's go.
We have so much to
tell you. -So do I.
There you are. Am I late?
-No. I just got here.
Good. Where's Casey? -She's
with some of her old friends.
That's a change. -A lot
of things have changed.
Well, they sure have, partner.
Where do you wanna go for
your congratulations lunch?
How about the new vegetarian place?
-Things haven't changed that much.
It's amazing, Sam.
They've given Eve a
whole new makeover.
Whatever it is, it's working.
Mommy, look what I got.
-Honey, that's wonderful.
Hi. I'm Eve. Show me
your 100-watt smile.
Eve's great No
matter where she goes
Dress her up from
her head to her toes
On the town, at the mall,
Eve loves high fashion
After dark, at the club, she'll
spend the whole night dancing
