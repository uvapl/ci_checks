Leave me alone
will you?
You think you're so smart.
Would you
stay still already?
What a geek!
I'm not a geek.
You're doing it wrong.
Shut up!
You're doing it wrong.
It doesn't go like that.
Who asked you?
Who's your brother?
You are, Stevie!
Right. You do it like this,
it'll open up in a fire,
you'll get
burned and die.
Let's go.
What do you
got there, Adcox?
A big deal?
Medium deal, Captain.
Brian, want to
come along?
Watch your old man
earn his keep.
Dad?
Stephen, you've come
a dozen times.
Give your brother a chance.
What do you say?
We'll be back in a minute.
How about it, sport?
Sure.
Come on.
Pull the cord, Brian!
1545 ldyllwild.
Give it a yank,
a good pull.
You've gotta get
these cars out of the way.
Give it another yank.
There it is,
right over there.
See it?
Okay. You stay
near the truck, pal.
That doesn't look too bad.
Drop two lines
and hold the squad.
Everything I own
is up there.
All my stuff's up there!
Adcox, ladder up.
That's your
old man up there, Brian.
Nice grab, Captain!
Take it easy.
You'll be okay.
We got it. Come on.
Dad!
Come on, Adcox.
Is that a gas line?
Dad!
Brian McCaffrey,
got some l.D.?
Hey, Willy.
I'll give you l.D.
The littlest McCaffrey.
How are you?
Hot off the presses, boys.
Station assignments.
McCaffrey,
station assignments.
Why don't you hold
onto that for me?
Something wrong
with my eyesight?
You trying this
fireman thing again?
Quitting once
wasn't good enough?
It's in the blood, Willy.
Willy, a beer!
Is that right?
Hold on. I'm talking
to the fire chief.
Let's look and see
what else was
in your blood.
I always looked
forward to getting these.
You hold onto those?
I got Station 17!
'Son?!
"Aspen Snowmobile Tours.
Brian McCaffrey,
Assistant Director, Sales."
You know,
for the kind of growth
and challenge I need...
"Mobile Log Cabins."
That was in your blood
six months?
The coffee sucked.
"Brian's Sound Spectrum,
Direct Hi-End Stereo Sales."
Your own company.
This was a big step.
I was ahead of my time, Willy.
What's the matter with you?
Aren't you even curious?
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know?
These are supposed
to be sealed.
Lucky guess.
And a case of
Scotch to the Captain
at station assignments.
You crooked son of a bitch.
Make us proud, guys.
McCaffrey, that's my
cousin's company. Come on!
Calm down, Mrs. Vaitkus.
Mrs. Vaitkus,
please calm down.
I think it's a box or a 2-11.
Just give me one minute.
Hurry up.
We can't miss this one.
Hi.
Hi, Jen.
I see your grandma...
Yeah, she still hates you.
You look great.
Thanks. How long
you been in town?
Four months.
Really.
But I...
I've been really busy
at the academy.
I graduated today.
I can see that.
What have you been up to?
I work at
City Hall, actually.
No kidding? That's great.
I don't know...
Maybe you and I
could get together
for a beer sometime.
A beer?
Beer? That's...
It's funny.
You're acting like
I just saw you last week
when I haven't seen you
in six years, Brian.
Son of a bitch.
Don't want you
overheating, Brian.
I'll give you overheating!
Well, you've
certainly matured.
It's nice to know
we can still be friends.
Come on, Brian.
We got a fire to go to.
Engine 17,
your pressure's fine.
Get out of
the way here, please.
Officer, don't just
stand there doing nothing.
Where you going?
I'm a fireman.
Need a second lead-out?
What?
What are you talking about?
Get out of here!
This is the real shit.
The real thing.
What do we got here?
A fireman's costume?
Where'd you rent it?
Thanks for coming
to my graduation
today, brother.
You're a real
inspiration to me.
I'm sorry.
You're really ready to
fight fire this time?
It just doesn't work on you.
I'll see you around.
Not likely.
Well, you see,
that's where
you're wrong already.
I talked to Chief Fitzgerald.
He decided you
shouldn't be way on
the other side of town
where I'd never
get to see you.
Starting tomorrow,
you're going to be
with the toughest company
in the city.
17. My company.
One case of Scotch, Brian'?
You're getting cheap
in your old age.
You should learn not to box
when the 17's on the job.
Inspector Rimgale,
she's all yours.
Hey, Shadow.
You got a cause there?
Mice with matches.
Those glory boys
will have to wait
a few days on this one.
Sean?
Hey, buddy, what's going on?
It's Uncle Brian.
You'll remember this.
Spinach?
We don't need no
stinking spinach.
Mum!
What's wrong?
Come here, it's okay.
- Hello?
- Yeah!
God, I'd about
written you off.
What's going on?
Can I come in for a second?
Sure.
How you doing?
Okay.
Good to see you.
So that's Sean?
He's a little giant now.
You'd be surprised
what a few years
can do to a kid.
Remember your Uncle Brian?
No.
You don't remember him?
Hey, Sean man.
Where's your daddy today?
Stephen's not
staying here anymore.
He moved out last April.
I'm sorry, Helen.
You guys should try
picking up the phone
once in a while.
I talked to Helen.
I thought Dad's boat
was finally retired
to the old family graveyard.
Don't you worry about
falling out of this thing?
I gotta tell you,
I love what you've
done with the place.
It's coming along.
You want a beer?
Why not?
You been ripping off
fire stations again?
Just some old stuff
Adcox gave me,
the department was gonna
throw out anyway.
It's good enough
for this tub.
What is this?
"Iron Butterfly? Cream?"
This isn't an actual
operating eight-track!
What do you want, Brian?
What are you doing here?
I wanna know why you messed
with my station assignment.
Does this really have to be
one of those big brother,
little brother,
"you broke my G. I. Joe
and I'm still pissed" games?
How do you do it?
How do you manage
to keep coming up
with new and amazing ways
to fuck up?
That Scotch bullshit?
Am I really
supposed to believe
you came home
because you
missed the family biz?
You were bankrupt.
Scary thing is you probably
could've got away
with it for a while.
Hang back a little
at the fires.
You know the drill.
The only problem is,
in this job there's
just no place to hide.
It's not like
having a bad day
selling log cabins.
You have a bad day here,
somebody dies.
And that's just not
fucking good enough.
You know something?
I must've told
myself a million times
I didn't even want
to be a damn fireman.
I know I quit
the academy before.
I know how you must've felt.
You do?
You know how I felt?
I gotta do this, Stephen.
I need to know.
I think you're
going to find out.
Try not to be
late tomorrow.
Give me a break.
Shit.
Come on, damn it.
Shit!
My car wouldn't start.
What are you doing, man?
Attaboy!
Damn!
Come on, man,
you can make it.
Baby McCaffrey,
how you doing?
How you doing, John?
Axe, you know this rug rat?
Know him?
I practically raised him.
He never calls.
He never writes.
I'm Brian.
I'm sorry.
All right! Garment factory.
Shake and bake.
I think we got a barbecue.
Got yourself a hot one
first time out.
This is gonna
taste like shit.
All right, let's go!
Shit!
I hate it when we
gotta go look for it.
There's people
up there! Hurry!
Call in a box.
We're gonna need
some back-up.
Brian, inch-and-a-half.
Get the high-rise jet.
These moments do try me.
Be gentle now, Axe.
Holy shit!
Coming through.
Probie, how about it?
You ready?
Yeah!
You're doing it wrong.
All right, it's tight.
Stay beside me.
I mean, right beside me.
Come on, man. Kick it in.
Get down!
Show time!
Clear!
Got it!
Let's take it from the side.
No, let's hit this
bitch head-on!
It's gonna flash on us.
We gotta back out!
She'll steam
on us a little,
but she won't flash.
Go high in the ceiling.
Here comes your water.
Here it comes!
Come on, honey, steam us.
I knew
you were a pussy!
All right,
let's go for the throat!
Nightingale! Save your air!
Pull down that wall. Here.
Got it.
We gotta
ventilate this heat.
Hook us up to a standpipe.
Come on, hustle.
Shit!
It's in the walls.
How about it, probie?
Coming!
Come on.
We're going to lose this.
Shit!
Christ! Charge it.
Otis, is it...
<i>It's jumping floors.</i>
Where's the second company?
Sorry, John Wayne time.
You're on your own, boss.
No back-up.
Shit!
Dig in.
Dig in!
Come on!
What the hell's going on?
What's happening?
Slow down,
it's jumping floors to us.
Put your mask on.
It's gonna be
the real deal.
Down!
Cover up, Lieutenant!
Jesus Christ!
I'm burning up!
Put him out!
Pull!
All right. Go get it.
Hey!
Sorry, kid.
I thought you were dead.
We got it.
Let's go.
Man down!
Look out.
I'm going.
You go, we go.
Come on!
Pull!
Let's go!
The chief thinks
we got one left
behind downstairs,
a civilian.
Axe!
Take“.
Down to
two probies, perfect!
Take Tim and do a search!
Let's go, kid!
Go. Stay With him.
Let's move it, Brian.
Stay on this line.
You son of a bitch!
More line.
Help!
Stephen, over here.
Someone's over here.
Help!
Where's my brother?
I don't know.
I ain't seen him, Bull.
Is anybody in here?
Oh, my God. I got one.
I got one.
I got one.
Somebody,
give me a hand.
Is she going to be all right?
I'm afraid you're a little
too late with this one.
Sorry to hear
about the mannequin.
I heard you two were close.
You all right?
You didn't get burned,
did you?
I'm a little busy right now.
You've got
an awful short memory
for direct orders.
I told you to
stay beside me.
I heard somebody call.
And what's that shit
with the standpipe?
The cap was stuck!
I told you to stay right
be-fucking-side me, Brian!
I was doing it.
I was up there doing it.
You don't know what I did.
What you did was
drop the ball, probie.
You split the team up.
Get that part right.
You know what?
Let me get one of those.
Here you go.
I don't know, Axe.
I don't know.
That Stephen.
What goes through
that guy's head?
Never wears his mask.
Making us take it on
in the first room like that.
This shit's
happening too often.
Could've flashed.
Should've flashed.
But it didn't.
Stevie knows.
The guy's lucky.
Alderman.
Inspector Rimgale.
I need to get
in that trunk.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
Pretty fancy shoes
you're wearing
for a fire scene.
Guess you haven't
been to many fires.
We still haven't
gotten a report from you
on Alan Seagrave's death.
You'll get that answer
as soon as I do.
A man gets stuffed
through the windshield
of his own car.
Is that an accident or arson?
People are asking.
I gotta tell them something.
Let's get
to the point.
We get the feeling
that your office is
dragging out this case,
to embarrass the Alderman
because of his fire
department cutbacks.
I have an uncomplicated job.
To decide if a fire
is arson or not.
If so, to catch
the son of a bitch doing it.
If my investigative methods
happen to muck up
the campaign of
certain mayor wannabes,
I gotta tell you,
I'm not going to
lose any sleep over it.
Just give me the report
as soon as it's ready.
You'll have it.
Thank you.
He better not make any rights
on reds in my district.
Hi, how are you?
Hey, Swayzak?
You missed it, buddy.
Get over there.
Keep them busy.
You should've been there.
It was fucking great.
I mean it.
We almost lost a whole
goddamn company for you.
Since you shut down 33,
there's no fucking backup.
We appreciate it.
I don't know about the rest,
but you got
my vote for mayor.
If you have a problem,
why don't you help us?
Why not work
with the task force?
Task Force?
Three guys have died
because of cuts made
by your task force!
Know that little glow
that's starting to blink
in your eye?
That's your career
dissipation light.
It just went into overtime.
If anybody's lights
are about to go out,
believe me, they're yours.
Thanks a lot, fellas.
You did a great job today,
by the way.
Alderman,
will this affect your
task force findings?
So this is that big city job
you were talking about.
Yeah. Welcome home, Brian.
Where does he buy his shoes?
Did you check them out?
They're like fucking butter.
Do you have to do that?
Could you
believe that fire?
First day.
There we were, Adcox and me,
pulling that lady right out
of the fire's fucking throat.
We saved a life.
I love it here.
Fighting 17th. Goddamn.
Stephen's amazing.
You see
how he took that fire'?
By the balls.
I'm gonna be
that good someday.
You watch. You'll see.
You know what
Stephen said to me?
Right when the shit
was coming hard, he said,
"You never know
till the moment the fire
stares you down,
"if you're just
gonna do this job..."
"Or be great at it," right?
He using that line
of shit on you now?
You think he made
that little gem up?
My old man used
to use that line
every other day.
It's no line, man.
That's no line.
Hey, kid, we aren't waiting!
Not that way!
What's going on?
Come on. Let's go!
It's lunch, probies.
Let's get started.
A couple of crows!
<i>...in Itasca.
That money will probably
end up coming from...</i>
This better be good.
Or we feed you to The Thing.
You got something
against Dalmatians?
<i>Accident or murder?
That's the question
arson investigators</i>
<i>are struggling with
after a freak explosion</i>
<i>known by firefighters
as a backdraft...</i>
Pengelly,
you're on TV.
I saw you, too.
Look, that's me.
<i>...windshield of his car.
He has been identified
as Alan Seagrave,</i>
<i>a prominent Chicago CPA.</i>
<i>Despite pressure
from the city council,</i>
<i>fire officials refuse
to speculate on the cause</i>
<i>saying only that
their investigation
is continuing.</i>
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
As 17th's
official toastmaster...
And bullshitter.
Thank you, Santos.
Did I mention you were
cut out of my will?
I think it appropriate
that we recognize
the two asswipes,
probationary firemen,
among us today,
who were officially baptized
into the world
of old man fire.
First, to Tim.
Despite the fact
that he was born with
a dull expression
and a really
hideous pair of ears,
he not only took on the beast,
but pulled from its clutches,
assisted by a more
famous and brilliant
firefighter, me,
a kicking and
screaming civilian
who'll probably sue us
for breaking her fingernails.
And to Brian...
Help me, Santos.
Whose contribution
was both more beautiful
and less likely to sue us.
When I heard that
both McCaffrey brothers
were being assigned here
at this station
at the same time,
my heart was filled
with a sudden desire
to transfer.
So raise a glass, lads.
To funny-looking Tim
and the McCaffrey brothers
who despite the fact
they've gotten on each other's
nerves for years
have managed
with great effort
to still be pissed off
at each other.
Gentlemen.
Fuck you!
Thanks for the ride.
Brian, I'll see you tonight?
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.
<i>I've known Jack Fitzgerald
since he was a candidate.</i>
They had
fire engines then?
Get that man's name.
<i>And I gotta tell you,
he was just as ugly then.</i>
<i>Just kidding, Jack.</i>
Can I have a beer, please?
Hey.
How you doing?
<i>Home of the real firemen.</i>
<i>Enough of us
stroking each other.</i>
<i>Here's the man
we're here to honor,
Chief Jack Fitzgerald.</i>
<i>I know I speak
for everybody here.</i>
<i>It's about goddamn time
you retired and made
a promotion for somebody else.</i>
I think I better
change the view.
<i>I couldn't have
wished for a better life.
Thank you.</i>
I don't believe this shit.
Pretty boy,
get a load of this.
Wait till you listen
to this shit.
"Probationary fireman,
Brian McCaffrey,
"on his first fire,
showed the bravery
"and courage of
a veteran firefighter
"when he risked life
and limb to double-check
a burning floor, alone.
"Emerging victoriously
with Anna Rodriguez,
"a seamstress
for the North Shore
clothing company."
Axe, get a load
of this shit!
"McCaffrey first
gained prominence
as the subject
"of a 1972 Pulitzer
Prize-winning photo
"taken at the scene
of his father's death."
What are we
gonna do about this?
17, what's going on?
I think that it's union bylaw
that if you get
your picture in the paper,
even if it's bullshit,
you buy the whole
company a drink.
I'm gonna have
another double
on the hero!
Give him a hand over here.
What's this?
Leave him alone.
Good job.
Brian McCaffrey?
This is my boss,
Alderman Swayzak.
He wanted to meet you.
You should be proud of saving
that woman's life.
That was a hell of a job.
Don't believe
everything you read.
Don't be so modest, Brian.
See that?
That's a mannequin.
Look, Brian.
Let me just get down to it.
I've been checking you out.
Jennifer can't say enough
about you.
What it is...
I need your help.
I'm gonna offer you a job.
I've already got a job.
This job it's still
with the fire department.
One of your
best investigators,
Don Rimgale,
is working on a tough case.
He needs
an extra pair of hands.
If that name is gonna
come from my office,
I want it to be you.
Why is that?
I want someone from
a real traditional
firefighting clan.
We got all kinds
of traditions,
like dying young.
Thanks anyway.
Took you all of 30 seconds
to blow that off.
Brian, I know it's not
my place to say this,
but I think you're passing
on a great opportunity.
You're smarter than that.
I'm trying to do
something here.
Can't you see that?
I'm trying to be a fireman.
Not some kind of poster boy
for Swayzak.
There's gotta be at least
500 other smoke eaters here
that do that shit
for real every day.
Tell Swayzak to talk
to one of them.
Bull, slow down.
Helen, can I talk
to you for a minute?
What about?
It's about Sean.
Right here, right now,
you wanna talk about Sean?
How you doing, Stephen?
Hey, Jackson.
You don't have
to stop dancing.
It's only our son,
for Christ's sake.
You don't have to remind me.
I'm the one
taking care of him.
What about your
dumb ass brother?
Wait a second.
Saving a mannequin.
How fucking stupid
can a guy get?
You got anything else
you want to say
about my brother?
God damn you, McCaffrey!
Take it outside.
Knock it off.
I'll kick his ass!
I'm bleeding.
Knock it off.
Hey, I'm fine.
You never know
when to quit, do you?
Do you ever wonder why
you're stuck a fucking
lieutenant for life?
No.
Let's get a drink.
You Okay?
I'm all right.
Get him out of here!
I just wanna get a drink.
You don't need a drink,
you need to get the hell
out of here. Let's go.
The whole family's crazy.
- That was great.
- You nailed him.
He's all right.
He said something.
What'd he say?
I don't remember.
I can walk by myself.
I hurt my ankle.
Don't stand there
and laugh at me.
Get me up.
Photographer.
Think I can get
on the cover of
<i>Life</i> Magazine?
Is Axe a great guy?
He doesn't know shit
about what I want.
I've got
news for everybody.
I'm not my old man.
A fire won't get me, Brian.
I know more than he did.
I know more about fire
than all of them.
Time for bed, Sugar Ray.
Let me get those for you.
Get out of my way.
I can get my shoes off.
You're such
a pain in the ass.
You always were.
What are you talking about?
I saved your ass tonight.
Why don't they
trust me anymore, Brian?
The guys just
don't trust me anymore.
This boat could be great,
don't you think?
Maybe I'll just,
just take it out on weekends.
Sean and me.
We could just float.
Get it on
your shoulder, probie.
It's not a football.
You're not breaking
any records, Brian.
Get it on your shoulder,
like this!
Come on, Stephen!
Kick that old man's ass.
Run, damn you.
I'm coming.
Come on, Bull.
Oh, shit.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Run, damn you."
Okay, roll the hose.
Are you kidding?
By myself?
You heard me.
What about Tim?
What about Tim?
For Christ's sake,
next time I'll let you win.
You got a problem
with drilling, probie?
Is that it?
No. I don't have
a problem with drilling.
But let's just
have one drill.
Not one for the company
and one for me.
Roll the hose now.
I'm not gonna quit.
You hear me?
I'm not gonna quit.
My baby is still up there.
Please, somebody.
How many men
you got in there?
My baby-
Hold on, Steve.
Don't go in there.
Wait for the hose line.
Brian!
Don't take that
kind of shit from it.
Don't let it know
you're scared.
Stephen!
Look out!
We gotta wait
for a hose team.
No time.
Come on!
You ready?
We gotta wait
for a hose team.
Jump when I say.
It won't get us.
Hold your breath.
Stephen!
You kicked ass.
Way to go, Bull.
Thanks.
That was pretty crazy.
I waited.
I would've waited.
Don't worry about it.
But you did it.
You did it all the way.
You were really a hero.
It's not about being a hero.
I went in because
there was a kid up there.
I do what I do
because that's my way.
And it was Dad's way.
Maybe it's not
everybody's way.
Dad's way?
Did he tell you
that in a séance?
Fine.
You said you needed
to know something.
What did you learn today?
What if there had been
another kid up there?
I don't know.
What do you think, Brian?
Time to move on?
You're right.
You win.
You're the best.
Hey, Brian.
Brian.
Listen, Jen.
I've been thinking
about what you said
the other night.
If the offer's
still on the table,
I'd like to talk about it.
Great!
That's great,
really great news.
<i>The Alderman will be thrilled
that you're working with us.</i>
Marty's a good man, Brian.
Yeah.
Stop me
if I got this wrong.
The fire's almost out,
you're upstairs on
the unburned floor,
checking for heat. Correct?
Yes, sir.
Messages for you.
You've been told by
your battalion chief,
your captain,
and by me not to
do nothing, right?
Do nothing until ordered.
That's correct?
The itch starts.
The glory boy flash starts.
"I'm a hero. Heroes don't
just stand around."
That's what it was?
Yes, sir.
So you punched out
a window for ventilation.
Before or after you knew
you were standing in
a lake of gasoline?
Before or after you noticed
you were standing
in a lake of gasoline,
you idiot?
Before, sir.
You could have
burned or killed
half that company.
Also, you wrecked
the evidence that I use
to prove it's arson.
You know how hard
it is to determine
the cause of these fires.
Go home and you
think about that.
I'll have to
call him back.
Brian McCaffrey,
your new assistant.
Dennis' kid.
Why don't you go find
a corner to hide in?
I'll get to you later.
I don't wanna deal
with you now.
Great.
You still standing there?
I think we should
get something straight.
I was assigned to
this office by the city.
I know who you
were assigned by.
I knew your father, too.
He was a hell of a fireman.
He had a hell
of a reputation.
It don't cut slack here
as far as I'm concerned.
Swayzak sends
you here, fine.
I got nothing
to say about that.
Swayzak or no,
you work for me now.
You step out of line,
make one false move,
you're out of here.
Don't think you're the first.
Let's go.
Where we going?
Pest control.
Shadow, Shadow.
Hi, Shadow.
Hi, Ronald. How you doing?
Staying comfortable?
I didn't think
you would make it.
I wouldn't miss this.
Who's that?
He works for me.
Is he a fireman?
I like firemen.
You like everybody.
Brian McCaffrey.
Sure... No, that's Stephen.
He's the little one
with the hat.
What a treat!
Do I know you?
Your dad did.
Who is this guy?
Put it away.
Come on, Shadow.
He lost his dad
to the animal
and you didn't even tell him
who he was coming to see?
Let me tell you about Ronald.
He likes telephones.
He tapes matches
to the bell strikers
and then wrap it
in cotton with gasoline.
You had a whole
little thing going there,
didn't you?
And when you got bored?
What did you do?
He started making calls.
Never proved.
Tell him about us
down on State Street.
Nobody cares about that one.
It was your
basic warehouse torch
I was doing for the owner.
They are a cakewalk.
I just lost my concentration
and my animal turned on me.
Got the whole place
going like hell.
My hair was on fire, my hands.
Everything. I was dead.
Suddenly I was alive.
I was pulled out by my hero,
my Shadow here.
Except, he didn't see
this big tub of phosphorous.
Explosion lit
him up so bright,
left his shadow on the wall.
Still shy about
rolling up your sleeves?
Show him your stomach.
The funny thing about firemen,
night and day,
they're always firemen.
Ronald Bartel.
The parole board
has received Mr. Bartel's
fitness report.
He is I.D. 44.
Endorsement from
his section warden.
Dr. Norris?
As supervising psychiatrist,
I would describe
Mr. Bartel's progress
as remarkable.
Taking into account
his disability
and the six years
he's already served,
I recommend a parole.
Mr. Bartel.
Do you regret your crimes?
Yes.
And I'm aware of the pain
that I have caused.
If released,
will you commit
these crimes again?
No, I won't.
Do you consider yourself
ready for society?
Yes, I do.
You're ready,
all right.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Shadow.
Remember this?
Remember this, Ronald?
Remember who it belonged to?
What did you do
to that little girl?
It's not fair, Shadow.
What did you do
to that little girl?
I burned her.
You burned her.
What do you do
to old ladies?
Burn them.
And what
about the world?
What would you like
to do with the whole world?
Burn it all.
See you next year.
We figured
the body's the owner,
some guy named Cosgrove.
Weird blast.
Like that other guy,
the one through
the car windshield.
Explosion blew out
the flame before the first
engine even got here.
Good for us.
Not too good for him.
Bring the toolbox.
Tim, get the hot spots.
You in the cheap seats,
watch it.
Let's go.
McCaffrey,
need a special invitation?
Charge the line, Axe.
What do you want me
to do with this?
We got heavy smoke stains
observed in entry room.
Smoke demarcation line
is very low.
Fire never got hot enough
here to cook the soot off.
Come on, you sneaky
little son of a bitch.
Tell me where you came from.
Point me where you started.
Come on.
Burn indicators distended
toward northern wall.
Less soot here, more heat.
Lack of discoloration
in shattered glass
indicates slow burn
before explosion.
There's some little
dead rat critters here.
Fire originated in this room.
Took its time.
Hung out.
The air ran out.
It couldn't breathe.
It was snuffed.
But it wasn't dead.
The trapped heat laid low
waiting for someone
to give it one
big gulp of air.
Another backdraft.
This is our point of origin.
Let me have a crowbar.
No sign
of accelerants.
If it's arson,
somebody figured
a new way to hide it.
We got Alan Seagrave,
and Donald Cosgrove.
Both deaths due
to close encounters
with stationary objects.
We have an office door
for Cosgrove
and an '87 Porsche
for Seagrave.
No nonrelevant traumas.
No significant
blood toxicology.
Attitude of
both trajectories are
consistent with explosion.
They ran
the residue you scraped
from both front doors.
It's a combination
of plumber's putty
and rayophene gum.
It burns almost
completely away
when you light it.
So it was on both doors.
Yeah.
Something else
I want to show you.
You'll have to help me.
Why don't you come over
and help us?
I don't think so.
Not in my contract.
I just rewrote your contract.
Come on over and help us.
We're gonna
have to lift him.
Great.
He's not gonna
sell you insurance.
Just lift him up.
Hold on.
You see that patch
of shirt right there?
We wondered about
the discoloration.
I scraped a piece off
and ran a spectro on it.
On a lucky shot,
they picked up traces
of something.
What was it?
Tryohtichlorate.
Nobody around here
ever heard of it.
Trychtichlorate.
It eats magnesium.
An absorption catalyst
used in toxic
waste accidents.
They stopped making it
a couple of years ago.
We figured it got
in his clothes in
a gas state from the fire.
What was it doing
in the fire?
That's your job.
What are
you doing here?
Just fixing my roof.
You've gotta stop
just showing up on
the roof like this.
I wanted to,
not exactly,
apologize for
the other night,
especially since I
don't remember much.
I just wanted to say,
I don't know, something.
The great communicator.
What's going on, Stephen?
You only bang on the roof
when you got something
on your mind.
How's Brian doing?
He's out. Quit.
He just up and quit
for no reason?
I don't care what
you heard, Helen.
I treated him better
than any other probie
I ever had.
He probably hates my guts,
but at least he finally
took a look in the mirror.
Once again, Stephen's right
and somebody else is wrong.
You always gotta be right.
That's such bullshit.
Why?
Because I'm the first
to admit it when I'm wrong.
How often does that happen?
In a fire? Never.
He would have
bought it, Helen.
I'm telling you,
maybe not today,
maybe not next year,
but it would have happened.
He's my brother.
I couldn't just...
You just couldn't
live with that.
McCaffrey.
Take the top off.
Holy shit!
That's it.
Son of a bitch.
This guy is different.
He don't love fire.
Who?
The killer.
He used magnesium
to make it look
like an accident.
I got it after
we went to see Ronald.
Torchers want to fry
the whole goddamn world.
But the fires that
killed those guys
never burned up that much.
The trychtichlorate
hid the magnesium
in the plug,
but it burned slow.
And he made
his burns backdrafts.
But he killed these guys.
He could have killed
everybody there.
Backdraft blew out the flame.
That's it. That's the reason.
What reason?
Why backdrafts.
Whoever fried
Seagrave and Cosgrove
went to a lot of trouble
to make sure
they died by fire,
but also that the fire
blew itself out.
That's why they used
the putty in the doors.
What do we got?
A torch with a conscience?
No. We got a stone killer
trying to make a point.
You can make the call now.
It's arson.
I'm not calling anyone yet.
You can't rush this.
I've seen it happen before.
I wanna make sure
this torch doesn't walk.
We're gonna wait.
Mr. McCaffrey.
Welcome aboard.
Nice boat you got here.
You mean mine?
Not yet.
Glad to have you
as part of the team.
Let's get a picture with
Mr. McCaffrey and myself.
You look good.
There you go.
Thanks. Hi.
Have fun now.
Great night, isn't it?
Who is that?
Larry DeWaay.
Larry, how are you?
How's the job going?
Okay.
Is Rimgale
getting any better?
Rimgale's Rimgale.
He's just doing his job.
He hasn't done anything.
At this rate,
he won't declare it's arson
before he retires.
Will you get me out of here?
Otherwise I'll have
to go pick her up.
This is one
of the oldest fire stations
in the city.
What do you think?
It's homey.
The guys are
sleeping upstairs.
You're gonna
get me in trouble.
This is my office. Impressive?
Yes, it's very nice.
Lot of tradition locked up
in this old house.
See those doors up there?
They lead to the hayloft
when they had the old
horse-drawn engines.
Lot different then.
But kind of the same,
you know?
Do you miss it?
You seem like you do.
When I came back,
I knew.
I knew that I really
wanted to be a fireman.
Then Why'd you quit?
I should have said
I wanted to be a good one.
So show me your fire truck.
Mask up, lads.
Where is it?
I don't know.
There's alarms going off
on three different floors.
How do we know
if the floor's
gonna be on fire'?
When the doors open,
if it's hot
don't get out.
We'll start on this side.
I'll meet you down
at the end.
Come on.
High-rise gigs
give me the creeps.
We're early
on this one again
and it ain't even
broke out yet.
We're one short
with Brian gone.
Wait for the next-in engines.
Let's catch it
before it breaks out.
You want to learn something?
Yeah, I do.
Axe, go with Pengelly.
Take the other side.
Don't split us up.
It ain't safe.
I haven't got time for this.
Let's go to work.
Let me take the lead.
Do your job.
They need a line over here.
Come on.
You're so very sly,
but so am l.
She's hot and smoky
but she's not rolling yet.
Shit!
<i>Hello, 51.
51 to follow 17
in the truck.</i>
<i>11201 South Clark.</i>
What time is it, anyway?
All right, take it.
Wait. Make sure
you check it first.
Howdy, boys.
Here we go.
Now get that mask back on.
Clear!
Stay here.
You check that door
for heat, Tim?
Tim!
Watch out.
I got him. Move off.
Put it out!
Stretcher!
Get the
goddamn stretcher.
Through here.
Get that stretcher over here.
What the hell happened?
Tim! How did it happen?
Breathe, Tim.
You're all right.
Shadow. I got one here.
Christ.
Some guy named Holcomb.
Steve.
Steve, you all right?
How is he?
He's alive.
Is he gonna make it?
They're not saying.
He's in there.
I'm sorry.
You can't come in now.
Please stay outside.
I should have been there.
None of us should
have been there.
Don't tell me about
the chance I'm taking.
You didn't
wait for back-up.
You were wrong.
Part of your investigating?
You had to do it.
You had to be myth man.
Taking another fire
bare handed
instead of looking out
for your probie.
He didn't listen.
He's a candidate,
your responsibility.
He shouldn't have been there
in the first place.
You burned him, Stephen.
Fuck you.
Don't you walk away from me.
Come on!
Easy, man.
You're just
making things worse.
Forget about it.
Inspector.
Alderman.
Chinese sponge cake?
When will you
catch this prick, Don?
Don?
Don't you have any leads?
No, Marty, I don't.
We haven't found
any connection between
the victims at all.
Jesus Christ. Open your eyes.
You got Seagrave, Cosgrove,
and now Holcomb.
Put them together.
It's a goddamn list.
I didn't know the name
of that victim had
been released.
Hey, John.
Morning.
I'll do whatever
you want me to do.
I want to help you nail
the son of a bitch
that burned Tim.
Show me how.
Thought old Marty
was acting a little strange.
He's right. There's residue.
Holcomb is the third victim.
The backdraft was set up
somewhere in there.
Fried Holcomb
when he opened
the inner door.
But the outer door held
and it waited for Tim.
In a word, Brian,
what is this job all about?
Fire.
It's a living thing.
It breathes, it eats
and it hates.
The only way to beat it
is to think like it.
To know this flame
will spread this way
across the door
and up across the ceiling.
Not because of the physics
of flammable liquids,
but because it wants to.
Some guys on this job,
fire owns them.
Makes them fight it
on its level.
But the only way
to truly kill it
is to love it a little,
just like Ronald.
I heard your friend's
gonna be okay.
Thanks.
Jen, we checked
and your boss was partners,
with all three murder victims
in a company called
Lakeside Dynamics.
He's keeping that a secret.
I wanna know why.
I don't know
anything about that.
You might be able
to find out.
Get me his files.
Do you know what
you're asking me to do?
Yeah.
Four years ago
I was punching
a cash register.
Two years ago,
Swayzak didn't
even know my name.
I was bringing
the guy coffee.
I practically run
that office now.
And Marty,
he believes in me.
I just don't...
You're asking me to
throw that all away.
Your boss is a liar.
Stephen?
I'm sorry.
I just couldn't sleep.
What's wrong?
It used to be real clear.
When I was a kid.
What meant most to me
about this job was
no ifs.
Somebody called
the fire department,
we came.
We just showed up.
They just don't know
how much I love them.
You don't leave
people hanging.
It holds everything up,
doesn't it?
Loyalty.
I don't get it.
"Till death do us part."
Isn't that what
you heard, Helen?
You go, we go.
It's all the same
piece of shit
without that, isn't it?
It's the end of everything.
I'm sorry I came.
There's just nobody
I can talk to.
I really miss you.
You sure
you want to put grape jelly
in the eggs?
It's part of my formula.
It's an experiment.
An experiment?
I want to do that.
Can you do it?
That's good.
I'll put that in the formula.
What about the shells?
You gonna leave the shells?
They're part of the formula?
I guess you know
what you're doing.
Mum!
I didn't know
you'd be up so early.
Go back to bed.
We're making you
breakfast in bed.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Yeah.
You keep going there.
You're doing good.
He knows what he's doing.
He told me he likes
those piano lessons
you got him taking.
I don't want
to confuse him.
I knew who you were
when we got married.
I knew how you did things.
And...
I mean, you haven't...
I just can't anymore.
I just... You know...
I gotta worry about Sean.
I mean, you're the best.
You really are.
But the chances
that you take just...
You scare me now.
Sean.
Listen, I...
I blew it.
I forgot that I gotta
work this morning.
That's all right.
We'll just do it again
next Saturday.
Mom's crying.
The latest polls came in.
Marty?
Jesus Christ, Marty.
What's going on?
We have a city
planners meeting
in 15 minutes.
You've gotta level with me.
Is there something
about these deaths
you're not telling me'?
No.
What's this?
Just take it.
Rimgale's gonna wanna
talk to Swayzak about this.
I'm sorry.
That's a dumb thing to say.
You're right.
Goodbye, Brian.
What do you do
with this thing?
What do you mean?
I drove it.
This is a copy of
Swayzak's report
we know is bullshit,
but the numbers were airtight.
This file she gave you
proves it's phoney.
I checked on
the firm that recommended
the cuts to the task force.
They've done exactly one job,
a manpower study.
I checked further.
It's not even a company.
No employees, nothing.
Just a P.O. box.
I wonder who wrote
that report.
Someone who can work numbers.
Exactly.
Like a bunch of dead
financial wizards.
Seagrave, Holcomb,
Cosgrove...
And Swayzak.
Why did he go through
this trouble to
cut firehouses?
Swayzak converts them
into community centers.
That's sweet.
Remember Lakeside Dynamics?
They get all the expensive
construction work.
I'm telling you,
this is a total scam.
These guys were making
a ton of money.
It's time we had a little
talk with Mr. Swayzak.
Let's go.
Mr. Swayzak?
Gas. Check in there.
Come on!
Come on!
Hey, kid.
I think I got
a little problem here.
<i>Alderman, is it true
that you were rescued</i>
<i>by the fire department's
arson team?</i>
<i>That's quite a bunch of guys.</i>
I'm so goddamn
helpless here.
I can't do a fucking thing.
What do you want me to do?
I've been lying here.
I've been thinking for hours.
Thinking and thinking.
We're close.
But we're not looking
in the right place.
So, you've come to pick
Ronald's brains
because nobody knows
the animal like Ronald.
It must've looked like
it was going to be
a medium deal, didn't it?
Then your father bought it.
What?
Did you watch him
when he made that
ballsy jump and saved...
I didn't come to talk
about my father.
I sent away for a copy
of that <i>Life</i> magazine
with your picture
on the cover.
It's a collectible.
Who's doing this?
Wrong question.
Who isn't?
It isn't a spark.
There isn't enough damage,
so it's no fun.
It isn't an insurance pro
because there
isn't any profit.
Who does that
leave us with?
What's his tool?
How does he do it?
How does he talk to the fire'?
Come on.
The outlets.
No.
That's a probie.
That's beneath you, Brian.
Trychtichlorate.
Very good.
You still haven't
put it together?
I have.
Then who?
You wanna know who?
I wanna know
if this kid
really wanted to be
just like his dad.
Did he?
Okay.
I'm out of here.
All right!
I wanted to be him, okay?
I wanted to be him
more than anything.
You loved him.
Yeah.
You watched him
dance with the animal.
You saw your dad burn.
Fuck you!
Who the hell's doing this?
Did it look at you?
Did the fire look at you?
It did.
Our worlds aren't
that far apart, are they?
Whoever did this
really knows the animal well.
They know him real well
but they won't let him loose.
They won't let him have fun
so they don't love him.
Who doesn't love fire
and is around trychtichlorate
all day long?
Oh, my God!
That wasn't such a long walk
after all, was it?
God damn it, Stephen.
What's going on?
I just came by to see
how you were doing.
How am I doing?
I'm selling Dad's boat.
A guy is coming by
in a few minutes
to take a look at it.
What are you gonna do?
Where you going?
I didn't say I was
going anywhere.
Look, I gotta get back.
There's something
I'm supposed to do.
What?
What do you gotta do?
Look at you.
Look at your face.
All the things you
must be thinking.
You really hate
my guts, don't you?
You know something?
That's all right.
We should talk...
You don't like me.
Because of the way
I raised you?
Dad was gone.
What was I supposed to do?
You tell me.
What was I supposed to do?
It's okay, Stephen.
I tried. I wanted
so many things for you
that I couldn't even hope for.
Because after that,
I had no choices.
I'm not your father.
You got somewhere to go, go.
People change.
Sometimes right
when you're looking at them.
What's going on with you?
I don't know.
Do you?
I gotta go.
<i>Attention,
all units responding.</i>
<i>This is
a hazardous material response
at a chemical plant.</i>
Has Stephen gotten back yet?
He just pulled up.
Is it Adcox?
How do you know?
I didn't.
I didn't until you came
looking for chemicals,
for me.
What were they doing there?
Axe gave them to me.
We gotta roll!
I'll be there in a minute.
I gotta go to
Rimgale with this.
They're pulling a box.
I'll be there!
I'm his lieutenant.
I'll handle it.
Stephen?
Are you a part of this?
No.
You're sure?
That's the only thing
I am sure of anymore.
Bull, we need you.
Jesus Christ!
Shit!
Get out of the way!
You all right, Peng?
You Okay?
Help me out.
Where's 17?
I don't know.
Stephen!
Where's 17?
17's on the roof.
Mask up.
We got a chemical fire.
- We're pulling the plug.
- Everybody off the roof!
Jesus Christ, Axe.
You don't understand.
My cousin used to work
at Swayzak's office.
She saw the files.
She saw what he did.
You set me up
with those chemicals.
Let me explain.
You back off!
Somebody had to
stop these pricks.
Axe.
Please listen to me.
You burned people!
You're a fireman.
When Sally showed me
Swayzak's files...
I should've
let you in on it.
On murder?
Those assholes were
closing firehouses,
getting our friends
killed for money.
I did it for the department!
Did you do it for Tim?
That was an accident.
Did you start that fire?
Why'd you have to go
in there so fucking early?
That's why you
wanted me to wait.
Let me finish Swayzak!
No. It's over.
Your dad would puke
if he saw you now.
What would he say about you?
Your dad died
saving my life,
and these people
were killing firemen
for money.
Swayzak.
He killed our friends
for money.
What the fuck would you do?
You're his lieutenant.
You've gotta handle this.
It's going.
Get to the side.
It's gonna go.
17! Somebody!
I'm in the elevator shaft.
Help me!
Help, somebody!
17, help!
Brian!
Stephen.
I'm burning up
in here!
You all right?
Yeah. You all right?
Come on.
We gotta go get him.
We gotta get out of here.
The whole place is going up.
Look out! This way.
Wait a minute. Brian!
Jesus!
I just couldn't
let it go, Bull.
I got you.
Let me go, Bull.
You go, we go.
Stephen!
No!
Don't move.
Don't move, damn it!
What?
Just lie down.
Shit!
Pengelly, up here!
Did you
hear somebody?
Pengelly, up here.
Where's he at?
I got him over there.
PengeHy!
We're gonna get
you out of here.
Lay down, don't move.
Get going!
Pengelly,
I lost the line.
I'm going for the hose.
Brian!
Go!
Come on.
Look at him.
That's my brother,
God damn it.
How is he? Is he okay?
Let's move it.
Let's go.
Up With him!
He's gonna make it.
I gotta get this collar on.
Help us out.
I don't want it.
Brian?
Don't tell them about Adcox.
It'll hurt the department.
I won't.
Monitor on.
I'm sorry. I thought...
90 over 60.
I'm sorry
lever thought you...
I know.
I beat it.
Blood pressure:
80 over 60.
The fire never got me.
You're gonna be all right,
you hear me? Hang in there.
You'll make it!
Lidocaine, now!
Will he be all right?
He's spiking!
Who's your brother, Brian?
You are, Stephen.
Lidocaine in.
I'm tired of
hearing the sirens.
Turn the
siren off, Brian.
Turn the siren off.
You're gonna be all right.
Hang in, you'll make it.
Let's go. Move this thing.
Don't you die on me now.
You hear me?
Hang in there.
We're almost there.
It's not your time now.
I need you.
You're gonna make it.
Clear!
Starting compression.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
<i>In the Chicago
Fire Department,</i>
<i>the alarm code

<i>We will now ring out

<i>Firefighter John Adcox and

Honor guard, hand salute!
Honor guard, dismissed!
Can we help you?
Police. We have a subpoena
for Alderman Swayzak.
Alderman Swayzak,
how are you doing?
This won't take long.
I'm in a press conference.
The police want to know
why you secretly paid
Cosgrove, Holcomb,
and Seagrave
to create a phoney
manpower study.
Ask him who made money
off firemen dying.
See that glow flashing
in your eye?
That's your career
dissipation light.
It just went into high gear.
My aides will look into it.
Thank you.
Mr. Alderman
has no further comment.
This conference is over.

Got it, Cap?
Into the truck.
