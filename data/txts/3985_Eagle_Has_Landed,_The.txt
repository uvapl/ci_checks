<b><u>Good morning !
- Good morning , Herr Admiral !</u></b>
<b><u>Oberst Radl , send him to me at once!</u></b>
<b><u>l`ve notified Mr. Oberst radel
of your arrival . - Thank you !</u></b>
<b><u>Come in , Radl .</u></b>
<b><u>Admiral !</u></b>
<b><u>Come and sit down .</u></b>
<b><u>Your meeting went well?</u></b>
<b><u>Monsieur had something
specific in mind .</u></b>
<b><u>A simple exercise in logistics .</u></b>
<b><u>Nothing very complicated .</u></b>
<b><u>He merely wants Wins ton
Churchill brought . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .from London to Berlin .</u></b>
<b><u>And we`re ordered to make
a feasibility study.</u></b>
<b><u>Today`s Wednesday, by
Friday he`ll forget it.</u></b>
<b><u>But,Himmler will not.</u></b>
<b><u>Has Fuehrer Himmler approved?</u></b>
<b><u>Only of my being put on the spot.</u></b>
<b><u>That meeting , you should`ve
seen it, Radl !</u></b>
<b><u>There was Hitler, first
ran ting then cajoling .</u></b>
<b><u>Known perfectly rational,then raging and stumping like a..</u></b>
<b><u>. . like the ringmaster
of some freak circus !</u></b>
<b><u>Goebbels , hopping from one
foot to another like a . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . like a schoolboy!</u></b>
<b><u>Bohrman, a vulture! Perched in a corner,watching.</u></b>
<b><u>. . listening , never speaking !</u></b>
<b><u>And Mussolini , Mussolini !
An automaton , Radl !</u></b>
<b><u>And l looked round that
room , and l wondered .</u></b>
<b><u>Am l the only one who can see it?</u></b>
<b><u>And if so, what must
l look like to them?</u></b>
<b><u>Herr Admiral , the feasibility s tudy.</u></b>
<b><u>Will be a total and unnecessary
waste of time!</u></b>
<b><u>Make it immediately!</u></b>
<b><u>Complete for the last month . lf
Herr Oberst could give me. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .a rough idea of our problem , l
can be quite specific about it.</u></b>
<b><u>The Fuehrer has instructed us
to kidnap Winston Churchill .</u></b>
<b><u>Good God !</u></b>
<b><u>Well Karl , at least do a
feasibility study on it.</u></b>
<b><u>There`s something that
fits our needs . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .that came in yesterday.</u></b>
<b><u>Well , l just mentioned
it, if l remember.</u></b>
<b><u>lf l may, sir.</u></b>
<b><u>No. Yeah , here it is .
From codename Starling .</u></b>
<b><u>A village in England called
Studley Constable.</u></b>
<b><u>How do we receive report s
from this Starling?</u></b>
<b><u>From the Spanish Embassy in London ,
by diplomatic pouch .</u></b>
<b><u>There is also radio contact.</u></b>
<b><u>Exactly where is Studley Constable?</u></b>
<b><u>its the East Coast of England .
County of Norfolk.</u></b>
<b><u>Let`s have a look at the place.</u></b>
<b><u>Larger scale.</u></b>
<b><u>Certainly, Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>Ah , here.</u></b>
<b><u>Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>isolated coastline. Very old ,
wide beaches , salt marshes .</u></b>
<b><u>ldeal . Now, a man to lead it, Karl .</u></b>
<b><u>Crash landed 1940 , flyer assault.</u></b>
<b><u>Alba canal , Belgian ,

<b><u>Herr Obers t Kurt Steiner.</u></b>
<b><u>Speaks the language?</u></b>
<b><u>Educated in England .</u></b>
<b><u>There come the last month , despite
Goerring`s guarantee.</u></b>
<b><u>Are you familiar with the
works on Jung , Karl .</u></b>
<b><u>l`m aware of the works of Jung
not familiar, Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>. A very great thinker,
a rational man .</u></b>
<b><u>And yet he speaks of something . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . called synchronicity. Events
having a coincidence in time.</u></b>
<b><u>Because of this the feeling that some much deeper..</u></b>
<b><u>. . motivation is involved .</u></b>
<b><u>Yeah , yeah , l understand that, sir.</u></b>
<b><u>Take this affair.</u></b>
<b><u>Fuehrer comes up with this
absurd suggestion that we. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .emulate SquadZany by
abducting Churchill .</u></b>
<b><u>Now for political reasons
we`re prodded in to making . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .a worthless report
of the prospects .</u></b>
<b><u>And then suddenly, synchronicity
raises its . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .disturbing head .</u></b>
<b><u>Yeah , yeah , l see that.</u></b>
<b><u>We receive a routine report
with a brief notation .</u></b>
<b><u>That next month , after visiting
a local Bomber Command . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . Churchill will spend a week end
in a country manor. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . less than 7 miles from
a deserted coastline.</u></b>
<b><u>At any other time this report
would mean nothing .</u></b>
<b><u>But this particular time,
that particular file. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . become the circumstance
which titillates .</u></b>
<b><u>Coincidence to tease us .</u></b>
<b><u>But surely Herr Oberst doesn`t really believe..</u></b>
<b><u>. .this thing could be carried off.</u></b>
<b><u>A wink for a pretty girl at a party,
results rarely in climax, Karl .</u></b>
<b><u>But a man is a fool not
push his suggestion..</u></b>
<b><u>. .as far as it would go.</u></b>
<b><u>Find this man for me, Karl . He is
been out of Germany too long .</u></b>
<b><u>Hans , Hans !</u></b>
<b><u>Let`s stretch our legs.</u></b>
<b><u>Stay on the train ! No one
allowed off the train .</u></b>
<b><u>l beg your pardon , sir!</u></b>
<b><u>Sir, l`m sorry but you must
remain on the train .</u></b>
<b><u>lf memory serves me, the Polish
army surrendered in 1939 .</u></b>
<b><u>Sir?
- Who are these people?</u></b>
<b><u>Oh Jews , sir?
- Jews?</u></b>
<b><u>They are ready to get in to the
ground . Defending them up.</u></b>
<b><u>They put up one hell of a fight,
I can tell you . - Oh how?</u></b>
<b><u>With umbrellas and crutches?</u></b>
<b><u>Halt, halt!</u></b>
<b><u>I`ll take the prisoner now.
- Prisoner?</u></b>
<b><u>What is?
- Here!</u></b>
<b><u>What is your name?
- Brana .</u></b>
<b><u>Good luck, Brana .</u></b>
<b><u>Identify yourself.</u></b>
<b><u>Oberst Kurt Steiner.</u></b>
<b><u>Commanding the 12th
parachute detachment.</u></b>
<b><u>A salute is customary to
a general , Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>Even to one of S S .</u></b>
<b><u>You didn`t seem quite so
discriminating , a moment ago.</u></b>
<b><u>I Have nothing for or against
Jews personally.</u></b>
<b><u>But I`ve seen too many good
men die for cause..</u></b>
<b><u>. .to watch a young girl
be killed for sport !</u></b>
<b><u>Excuse me sir, but doing his duty.</u></b>
<b><u>He reminds me of something that
I occasionally pick up on . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . my shoe in the gutter! Very
unpleasant on a hot day!</u></b>
<b><u>And if you have the dubious
honour of commanding this . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . senseless saughter, l`d
advise you to keep him . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .downwind a tall times !</u></b>
<b><u>That is of course, if you can
tell the difference anymore!</u></b>
<b><u>For God`s sake Kurt!</u></b>
<b><u>What am l to do with
you , Herr Oberst?</u></b>
<b><u>You`re a military hero. You
were honoured with the. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . Oak Leaves and Swords
for gallantry.</u></b>
<b><u>Yet responsible for the
attempted escape. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .of the enemy of the state.</u></b>
<b><u>Abetted by the mutinous
conduct of your men !</u></b>
<b><u>By rights you should all
be court-martialled</u></b>
<b><u>Difficult decisions are
the privilege of rank. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . Herr Croper-Fuehrer.</u></b>
<b><u>But, as for my men, ..</u></b>
<b><u>. .they seem to
feel a certain loyalty to me.</u></b>
<b><u>l don`t suppose you could
content yourself with . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . my head and overlook their
part in this thing?</u></b>
<b><u>There you are, see Hans?
lt`s infallible.</u></b>
<b><u>l can always tell a thorough
going bastard when l see one.</u></b>
<b><u>Herr Oberst?
- l  here, Karl .</u></b>
<b><u>Good morning !</u></b>
<b><u>Good morning , Herr Oberst!</u></b>
<b><u>material arrives from Starling .
lt`s excellent, Karl !</u></b>
<b><u>Truly excellent!</u></b>
<b><u>Starling is to be commended .</u></b>
<b><u>Yeah . This is good .</u></b>
<b><u>What news of Oberst Kurt Steiner?</u></b>
<b><u>We`re having some difficulty
in tracing him , Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>He appears to be back in Germany,
but just exactly. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . where we`ve run
in to road blocks . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . if Herr Oberst knows what l mean .</u></b>
<b><u>Even though there was a
court-martial . But we`ll find him</u></b>
<b><u>l`m sure. And now to possible
undercover operative.</u></b>
<b><u>l`ve decided on this man , he is
currently lecturing in that. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . university here in Berlin .
Send for him immediately.</u></b>
<b><u>Yes . - Von Karl , . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . send this
message to Starling .</u></b>
<b><u>Yes , Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>Where is Herr Oberst Radl?</u></b>
<b><u>He is in the map room ,
Herr Admiral .</u></b>
<b><u>This message has been sent out.
Did you originate it?</u></b>
<b><u>l did , Herr Admiral .</u></b>
<b><u>Very interested in your
visitor of 6th November.</u></b>
<b><u>Would like to drop some friends
to meet him in the hope . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .they might persuade
him to come back with them .</u></b>
<b><u>Your comments expected by usual
route with all relevant. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . informa tion . You`ve exceeded
your authority, Radl .</u></b>
<b><u>You were told to prepare
this feasibility study. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . not embellish a joke!</u></b>
<b><u>With Herr Admiral`s permission ,
it`s no longer a joke.</u></b>
<b><u>lt could be done.</u></b>
<b><u>In my opinion it should be done.</u></b>
<b><u>What if Churchill prefers to die?</u></b>
<b><u>What if abduction becomes
assassination?</u></b>
<b><u>No one specified dead or alive.</u></b>
<b><u>God in Heaven ! Kill Churchill? When
we`ve already lost the war?</u></b>
<b><u>Sure you`ve done a good job,
Radl . Very thorough .</u></b>
<b><u>But this operation, could make
the Charge of the Light Brigade ..</u></b>
<b><u>. . look like a sensible
military exercise! Drop it!</u></b>
<b><u>Herr Obers t, he`s arrived !</u></b>
<b><u>Come in , Colonel . Radl , isn`t it?</u></b>
<b><u>ACaf? de Moren to you(Irish accent) ! lt`s not
rish Whiskey, . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . but it will do to be going on with .</u></b>
<b><u>Better for you to drink than me.</u></b>
<b><u>I`ve the feeling I might be
needing it. May I ? - Yeah</u></b>
<b><u>The last time I was invited up
here to Section 3 , one of. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .your guys persuaded me
to jump out of a Dornier.</u></b>
<b><u>5,000 feet above Ireland ,
in the dark.</u></b>
<b><u>And me with this terrible
fear of heights .</u></b>
<b><u>You`re planning a holiday
to England , are you?</u></b>
<b><u>They say that Brighton`s lovely
this time of the year.</u></b>
<b><u>God ! What in Christ are those?</u></b>
<b><u>They are Russian , Mr. De vlin .
I picked up . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .a taste for them
in the winter war.</u></b>
<b><u>Well , the y`re probably the only
thing that kept you . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .awake in the snow.
- Yeah?</u></b>
<b><u>Yeah !</u></b>
<b><u>Now, l had a proposition to
put to you , Mr. Devlin .</u></b>
<b><u>You had?</u></b>
<b><u>Have.</u></b>
<b><u>l`m working you know, Colonel .</u></b>
<b><u>The University! For a man like
you it would seem rather. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . like a thoroughbred racing horse. .</u></b>
<b><u>finding himself pulling a milk cart.</u></b>
<b><u>Why, you`ve got a way
with words , Colonel .</u></b>
<b><u>You want me to go back
to Ireland , is that it?</u></b>
<b><u>And I can`t do it. I
wouldn`t last a week.</u></b>
<b><u>They`d arrest me and throw me back.
- No, no, . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .we don`t want you
to go back to Ireland .</u></b>
<b><u>Not the way you mean . No.</u></b>
<b><u>You`re still a supporter of
the Irish Republican Army?</u></b>
<b><u>Sort of, Colonel .
Once in , never out.</u></b>
<b><u>But you`re here in Germany
and your compatriots ..</u></b>
<b><u>. . in England , why?</u></b>
<b><u>We don`t like soft target hits .</u></b>
<b><u>We don`t want to spend
my days in Bayswater.</u></b>
<b><u>Mixing up explosives in
my landlady`s saucepan . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .to break the arms and legs
of a couple of passers-b y.</u></b>
<b><u>My fight is with the bloody
British Empire!</u></b>
<b><u>And I`ll fight it
on my own two feet.</u></b>
<b><u>lf it`s some rabid fanatical
you`re after, Colonel . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .they sent you the wrong man .</u></b>
<b><u>Am l correct or Wrong , your
aim is still total victory. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .against England .</u></b>
<b><u>No, that`s your aim . My
aim , United Ireland .</u></b>
<b><u>I appreciate the distinction
but either way it would be. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . necessary for Germany
to win the war first.</u></b>
<b><u>Pigs might fly one day, colonel,
but I doubt it.</u></b>
<b><u>Mr. De vlin , l want you to
go to England for me.</u></b>
<b><u>Colonel , I barely know you .</u></b>
<b><u>To assist in the kidnapping
and safe return to Germany. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .of Winston Churchill .</u></b>
<b><u>Give me another one of them
Bolshevik firecracker, will you</u></b>
<b><u>I think I fell asleep in the snow.</u></b>
<b><u>Herr Oberst, good evening ,
Herr Oberst!</u></b>
<b><u>l`m Sturm fuehrer Tuborg of the S S .</u></b>
<b><u>Reich-Fuehrer Himmler presents
his compliments .</u></b>
<b><u>And request s you to get the entire
file designated , `Eagle` .</u></b>
<b><u>And when is that to be?
- Now, Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>You seem nervous,  Herr Oberst.
Please relax.</u></b>
<b><u>Sit down .</u></b>
<b><u>May l smoke, Herr Reich-Fuehrer?
- No.</u></b>
<b><u>A masterful job.</u></b>
<b><u>Thank you , Herr Reich-Fuehrer.</u></b>
<b><u>But you know , there a reason
people  might say that..</u></b>
<b><u>. . such an operation could make
the Charge of the Light Brigade . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . look like a sensible
military exercise!</u></b>
<b><u>Have you heard that phrase
before, Herr Obers t?</u></b>
<b><u>I don`t immediately recall ,
Herr Reich-Fuehrer.</u></b>
<b><u>I know all about your plan .
I know what is written on . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .every single page. Even the
one, you haven`t got yet!</u></b>
<b><u>The court-martial of Herr
Oberst Steiner and his men .</u></b>
<b><u>The arrogance of this Steiner
is dazzling .</u></b>
<b><u>An unusual man .</u></b>
<b><u>This , this Steiner. Intelligent,
ruthless , brilliant soldier.</u></b>
<b><u>But above all, a romantic fool</u></b>
<b><u>He threw away everything .</u></b>
<b><u>Rank, career, the future.</u></b>
<b><u>He
is presently serving in a . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . Penal Colony on the
island of Alderney.</u></b>
<b><u>And all for the sake of
some little Jewess !</u></b>
<b><u>Whom he never clapped
eyes on before!</u></b>
<b><u>You know he is a veteran of
5 successful commando raids?</u></b>
<b><u>6 , I believe.</u></b>
<b><u>Educated in England , . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . speaks the language
perfectly without an accent.</u></b>
<b><u>The ideal man for the job,
eh , Herr Oberst?</u></b>
<b><u>lf you think so,
Herr Reich-Fuehrer.</u></b>
<b><u>And so do you .</u></b>
<b><u>But the  Herr Admiral canaris
doesn`t think so .</u></b>
<b><u>My loyalty to Herr Admiral .</u></b>
<b><u>I suceeded only by your loyalty
to the Fuehrer himself.</u></b>
<b><u>Is n`t that so?</u></b>
<b><u>l was sure of it. Now this
Churchill business .</u></b>
<b><u>Our Fuehrer wants it seen through .</u></b>
<b><u>Now, you`ve considerable autonomy
in running your office.</u></b>
<b><u>You ought to be able to use it.</u></b>
<b><u>As an excuse to prevent
Canaris . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .from knowing what`s going on .</u></b>
<b><u>What kind of authority will
have to clear . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . such a project through ,
Herr Reich-Fuehrer?</u></b>
<b><u>Aloud , if you please.</u></b>
<b><u>Herr Oberst Radl is working under
my direct and personal . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .orders in matters of the utmost
important to the Reich .</u></b>
<b><u>All personnel , military and civil ,
without distinction of. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . rank will assist him in any
way that Oberst Radl sees fit. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .to demand . Adolf Hitler.</u></b>
<b><u>So, you see, Radl? !</u></b>
<b><u>Under the
terms of that document. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .even I find my self under
your personal command .</u></b>
<b><u>Good luck! l can only envy. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .your inevitable
success in the matter.</u></b>
<b><u>Hail Hitler!
- Hail Hitler!</u></b>
<b><u>Are you in mine Command , on
the island of Alderney?</u></b>
<b><u>Distinct pleasure, Herr Oberst,
distinct pleasure!</u></b>
<b><u>Read this please.</u></b>
<b><u>l see, Herr Obers t. What
is it you wish of me?</u></b>
<b><u>That the period or team
of Operation Shark . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . is terminated at this moment.</u></b>
<b><u>That the Pleiser Steiner,
Von Mustadt and the 29 men .</u></b>
<b><u>18 held at this moment,
Herr Oberst, only 18 now.</u></b>
<b><u>The men are required to ride. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .the larger torpedo
craft in to enemy shipping .</u></b>
<b><u>The torpedoes detach , of course?
- Of course!</u></b>
<b><u>Most of the time!</u></b>
<b><u>Bare details, the usual
letters of commendation.</u></b>
<b><u>And for God`s sake, get the
names right this time.</u></b>
<b><u>Thank you , Herr Major!</u></b>
<b><u>But I thought I should.
- thank you ,  Herr major</u></b>
<b><u>Herr Steiner?
- Yes , l`m Steiner.</u></b>
<b><u>What is it?</u></b>
<b><u>My name is Radl .</u></b>
<b><u>Well , what is it?</u></b>
<b><u>l`ve two men to bury and no
office to make small talk in .</u></b>
<b><u>Your credentials are hopelessly. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . impeccable, Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>What can l do for you?</u></b>
<b><u>Lead a raiding party to England..</u></b>
<b><u>. .to kidnap Winston Churchill .</u></b>
<b><u>You don`t seem very much impressed .</u></b>
<b><u>I haven`t seen your plan yet.
- Here!</u></b>
<b><u>While he is making his decision . .</u></b>
<b><u>l`m going to that pub up there
and get some talk to mine.</u></b>
<b><u>The only time this plan
makes any sense with me. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . is when l`m drunk!</u></b>
<b><u>You`re in command here?
- Oberleutnant Koenig , Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>Con figuration seems smewhat
abnormal for an E-boat.</u></b>
<b><u>That`s because she is
actually a converted . .</u></b>
<b><u>..British MTB,  Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>Captured making a drop
off the Dutch coast.</u></b>
<b><u>At ease!
- Sir!</u></b>
<b><u>You`re familiar with the
East Coast of England?</u></b>
<b><u>Sure, Herr Oberst, l`ve been there.</u></b>
<b><u>5 years l was posted on
a cargo ship out there.</u></b>
<b><u>This could work you know.</u></b>
<b><u>lt will be done.</u></b>
<b><u>There is a direct order
from the Fuehrer himself.</u></b>
<b><u>I stood opposite Adolf once.</u></b>
<b><u>When he gave me this . No, I forgot.</u></b>
<b><u>One of those.</u></b>
<b><u>As a German officer you swore
the same oath as l did .</u></b>
<b><u>You`ve no choice.</u></b>
<b><u>Of course, l do. l`m going to
die here, anyway, eventually.</u></b>
<b><u>You forget, Radl , that
l`m under suspended . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . sentence for death .
Officially disgraced .</u></b>
<b><u>l do not retain my rank,
only my authority.</u></b>
<b><u>Because of the peculia r
circumstances of this job.</u></b>
<b><u>And l offer you a chance for
reinstatement of rank . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .and complete vindication
for you and your men .</u></b>
<b><u>My men need no vindication .</u></b>
<b><u>You said it could be done.</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s possible. Of all the world`s
leaders Churchill is probably. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .the least protected .
Unlike the Fuehrer.</u></b>
<b><u>Steiner, is thumbing your
nose at the Fuehrer . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . more important to you than
the lives of your men?</u></b>
<b><u>31 of you , a few weeks ago.</u></b>
<b><u>How many left?</u></b>
<b><u>- 16 .</u></b>
<b><u>You owe them this last
chance to live.</u></b>
<b><u>Or to die in England , instead .</u></b>
<b><u>I will put it to my men .
They`re entitled to know.</u></b>
<b><u>Only the destination for now.</u></b>
<b><u>Revealing the specific target
will be going too far.</u></b>
<b><u>I will put it to my men .</u></b>
<b><u>Steiner, it may not win the war, . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . but it would make them think
about a negotiated peace.</u></b>
<b><u>A negotiated peace?</u></b>
<b><u>l will put that to my men , also.</u></b>
<b><u>God bless all of you . Let`s
see your strongest, will you?</u></b>
<b><u>Gestapo. So that`s the way
the Gestapo is dressed . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . in Berlin these day s .</u></b>
<b><u>Gestapo?
- Drink?</u></b>
<b><u>l haven`t sucked my thumb in years .</u></b>
<b><u>l wonder if you`d be kind
enough to do it for me?</u></b>
<b><u>Sir?
- Suck it!</u></b>
<b><u>Now, about your Mr. Devlin .</u></b>
<b><u>Man of considerable guile
and resource, l assure you .</u></b>
<b><u>Tell me something , Mr. Devlin ,
just why`re you coming along?</u></b>
<b><u>You should tell , Colonel .</u></b>
<b><u>l`m the last of the world`s
great adventurers !</u></b>
<b><u>Sweet Mary, Mother of God !</u></b>
<b><u>Tough ones , your lads , he
is got in there, Colonel !</u></b>
<b><u>What did he say?</u></b>
<b><u>Steiner insisted on the unanimous
consent of his men .</u></b>
<b><u>l`m not surprised at that.</u></b>
<b><u>lf they agree, we leave tonight.</u></b>
<b><u>Tonight?
- Yeah , . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .you`ll be dropped
in Southern Ireland . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .as close to the Ulster
border as possible.</u></b>
<b><u>Tonight, but what about my papers?</u></b>
<b><u>Your Irish passport and British
medical discharge. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . have been provided . Starling`s
found you a job.</u></b>
<b><u>You`ll be a Marsh warden ,
whatever that is .</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s a Marsh Warden ,
what about the money?</u></b>
<b><u>10,000 u first.
- No, . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .they had said 20,000 u !</u></b>
<b><u>No, 10,000 has been deposited
in Geneva`s . .</u></b>
<b><u>Prince auctions. 10 more upon
completion of the mission.</u></b>
<b><u>You think I`d sell out.</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s just that you`ve
been so expensive. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .to buy in the first place.</u></b>
<b><u>You`re going to jump,
in those clothes?</u></b>
<b><u>l might look a little bit silly
going down , Herr Steiner.</u></b>
<b><u>but I'll be a lot safer
when I land on the ground.</u></b>
<b><u>There is an old poem l know,
which clearly translated . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .from the Irish say s , l realised
fear one morning .</u></b>
<b><u>The blare of fox and her sound .</u></b>
<b><u>When they were all chasing
after the poor bloody fox.</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s safer to be dressed
like a hound !</u></b>
<b><u>You`re quite a literary man , Devlin .</u></b>
<b><u>The truth , you know, Colonel .
l`m a bloody literary genius !</u></b>
<b><u>Read complete instructions .
- Right.</u></b>
<b><u>All of it, everything?
No cyanide pill?</u></b>
<b><u>I couldn`t conceive
of the situation . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .which would force you to take one.</u></b>
<b><u>This is a trick l learned from
an uncle l had in Belfast.</u></b>
<b><u>ln the middle ages , they would
have burnt you for that.</u></b>
<b><u>Good-bye, Mr. Devlin ! l
will see you in England .</u></b>
<b><u>l`ll be there.</u></b>
<b><u>How do l step out of this thing?</u></b>
<b><u>Release your safety belt! l turn
the aircraft upside down .</u></b>
<b><u>You drop out.</u></b>
<b><u>Did it ever occur to you that
the signature on that. .</u></b>
<b><u>..authoriztion you
keep handling out..</u></b>
<b><u>. . could just be a clever forgery? !</u></b>
<b><u>Why don`t you fly out Birch`s
garden and ask him yourself?</u></b>
<b><u>Oh , let`s not bother the man !</u></b>
<b><u>Mrs . Joanna Gray?
- That`s right!</u></b>
<b><u>Liam Devlin.</u></b>
<b><u>l could do with a cup of tea ,
it`s been a hell of a journey.</u></b>
<b><u>Come inside.</u></b>
<b><u>That`s a neat trick.</u></b>
<b><u>Old Irish one, taught one to me.</u></b>
<b><u>What`s her name
- Patch.</u></b>
<b><u>Patch</u></b>
<b><u>Sit down , Mr. Devlin .</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s lovely, the country side,
isn`t it?</u></b>
<b><u>You`d hardly know there
is a war on . Patch .</u></b>
<b><u>We`re living in a fool`s paradise.</u></b>
<b><u>We lack the discipline the
Fuehrer has brought to Germany.</u></b>
<b><u>These are various
papers you`ll need .</u></b>
<b><u>l`ll give you these. These are
the ones they gave to me.</u></b>
<b><u>You know, Sir Henry is
away for some time.</u></b>
<b><u>And only the servants
are in the Manor House.</u></b>
<b><u>Does anyone else know that Winston
Churchill will be here?</u></b>
<b><u>Only Father Verecker.
As to your duties .</u></b>
<b><u>Would , in the main be

which is park ed out side.</u></b>
<b><u>And , you can have the shotgun .
lt is loaded .</u></b>
<b><u>You know the way to the cottage?</u></b>
<b><u>Yes , l just go down the road ,
probably on my right, l go. .</u></b>

<b><u>Oh yes , father, l`m Catholic.</u></b>
<b><u>Did you come for confession?</u></b>
<b><u>Oh no, with apologies father, . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . l`m afraid this poor soul
is well past redemption .</u></b>
<b><u>God forgive me, but this
parish confession could do. .</u></b>
<b><u>. .with some spicy revelation
off and on then !</u></b>
<b><u>Oh , and don`t forget the words
of our Lord , Mr. Devlin .</u></b>
<b><u>The last will be the first.</u></b>
<b><u>Well , in that case father, . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . l`m assured a place

<b><u>Where did you find this?</u></b>
<b><u>D C

<b><u>Gerriker!
- Herr Oberst!</u></b>
<b><u>Will it be ready in time?</u></b>
<b><u>No problem , Herr Oberst.</u></b>
<b><u>Where did she go, huh?</u></b>
<b><u>Alright, my friend .</u></b>
<b><u>Look at you</u></b>
<b><u>You tricked me! Why
you little devil !</u></b>
<b><u>Oh God , l won`t know you till . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .the crack of doomsday
that`s for sure!</u></b>
<b><u>What`s that supposed to mean?</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s an expression l heard
from an American .</u></b>
<b><u>You use these things?
- No.</u></b>
<b><u>Good for you .</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s not so good . You`ve got your
green years still ahead of you .</u></b>
<b><u>Almost 19 , eh? What month?</u></b>
<b><u>February.</u></b>
<b><u>25th?
- 22nd .</u></b>
<b><u>But l was right,
So you`re a little fish.</u></b>
<b><u>You and me should get along well .</u></b>
<b><u>Me being a Scorpio. Never
marry a Virgo, though !</u></b>
<b><u>Virgo and Pisces never hit it off.</u></b>
<b><u>Now take Arthur for example.
l`ve a terrible hunch . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . he is a Virgo. You`ve
to wa tch it with him .</u></b>
<b><u>Well ! Arthur Seymour, are you crazy?</u></b>
<b><u>No, but l think he is true, clean ,
virtuous and not very hot.</u></b>
<b><u>That`s a Virgo.</u></b>
<b><u>And that`s a terrible shame
from where l`m lying .</u></b>
<b><u>You`ll have a terrible problem
with your weight. .</u></b>
<b><u>. . if you don`t watch your food .</u></b>
<b><u>Bastard</u></b>
<b><u>Are you laughing at me?</u></b>
<b><u>What else would you have me
do with you? Molly Pryor.</u></b>
<b><u>Now don`t answer that.</u></b>
<b><u>How do you know my name?</u></b>
<b><u>George Wyle told me. At the pub.
- Oh ! l see.</u></b>
<b><u>And Arthur was he there?</u></b>
<b><u>Oh you could say that.
l got the feeling . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .that he looks upon you
as his personal property.</u></b>
<b><u>He can go to hell !
l belong to no man .</u></b>
<b><u>Your nose`s turned up, did
anybody tell you that?</u></b>
<b><u>And when you get angry your
mouth turns down at the corner.</u></b>
<b><u>l`m sure you could find a
hundred things wrong with . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . me, Mr. Devlin . A thousand .</u></b>
<b><u>But you wouldn't throw me
out of your bed on</u></b>
<b><u>. .on a wet Saturday night. l`m sure.</u></b>
<b><u>That's men for you -
anything's better than nothing.</u></b>
<b><u>Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, come here.</u></b>
<b><u>You don`t know the first
thing about me.</u></b>
<b><u>Because if you did,
you'd know that I much prefer</u></b>
<b><u>one autumn afternoon
under the pines.</u></b>
<b><u>. .to a wet Saturday night any day.</u></b>
<b><u>Only sand has a terrible way of
getting where it shouldn`t be.</u></b>
<b><u>Get out of here!</u></b>
<b><u>Get out of here, before
my passion runs away with me.</u></b>
<b><u>Go on , get it. Get it!</u></b>
<b><u>They told me all lrishmen
were crazy.</u></b>
<b><u>Now l believe them ! l`ll be
at Mass on Sunday, will you?</u></b>
<b><u>Do l look like l will?</u></b>
<b><u>Yes , l think you do.</u></b>
<b><u>Oh Devlin , you bloody idiot!
You never learn .</u></b>
<b><u>You never bloody learn !</u></b>
<b><u>l`ve spoken with Himmler.
He`s sent personal wishes . .</u></b>
<b><u>. .for success from the
Fuehrer himself.</u></b>
<b><u>You`ve altered the parachutes , why?</u></b>
<b><u>Well unfortuna tely, we`ve high tide
at first light when we must drop.</u></b>
<b><u>So we may land in the surf.</u></b>
<b><u>These slot s , enable us
to guide the chutes .</u></b>
<b><u>lt`s experimental and the
landing velocity is high .</u></b>
<b><u>but we have no choice.</u></b>
<b><u>l assume they`ve been
adequately tested .</u></b>
<b><u>Sure, Herr Oberst!</u></b>
<b><u>l`ve one request. Demand actually.</u></b>
<b><u>Blackmail at tnis point,huh?</u></b>
<b><u>We`re not spies . And we`ll not
be trea ted as such . .</u></b>
<b><u>. . by the British ,
if anything goes wrong .</u></b>
<b><u>We`ll wear our own uniforms
under the Polish outfits .</u></b>
<b><u>And if necessary, we`ll fight
and die as what we are.</u></b>
<b><u>German paratroopers .</u></b>
<b><u>Max, it is not a subject
for negotiation .</u></b>

you a drink, after all .</u></b>
<b><u>l` m here in the hope that.
