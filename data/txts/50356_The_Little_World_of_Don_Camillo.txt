<i>Here is the town.
<i>A small world
in a small world
<i>placed somewhere
in the north of Italy.
<i>There it lies in that
slice of rich, flat earth
<i>between the Po
River and the Apennines.
<i>There is dense,
freezing fog in the Winter.
<i>In the Summer, a burning
sun hammers down on people
<i>and irritates them.
<i>Political passions
explode violently,
<i>and the fight it hard,
but men are always men.
<i>And what happens here
doesn't happen anywhere else.
<i>We are at the start
of the Summer of 1946.
<i>A few days ago, there was the
election of a new Town Council,
<i>and the Communists
have gained the majority.
Jesus, do you see
how far they've gone?
One day they'll even get in
here and trample our feet.
Sunday, when I said what I
thought of them from the pulpit,
someone suddenly jumped from a
bush and beat me with a stick.
<i>And you just got beaten up. You're
right, blessed are the peaceful.
I was carrying a dozen eggs,
and I was trying to save them.
It was dark, and I couldn't
see who it was, but if I knew...
<i>You must forgive those
who offend. That is the law.
<i>Just between us, a
trampling is good for you.
<i>You'll learn not to
do politics in my house.
In your place, I'd have never
allowed Peppone to be Mayor.
None of the new councilmen
know anything at all.
The illiterate are
directing town affairs.
<i>But you know they
had no time for school.
<i>Life is hard for those who work
the fields.</i> -Whose fault is that?
<i>It's the heart that
counts, not the grammar.
<i>Before you criticize,
let them get to work.
<i>Nobody can
discuss with you...
Listen to them now!
I taught them music!
Viva Peppone!
Say it with me,
"Viva Peppone!"
Viva Peppone!
Peppone! Say it with me,
"Viva Peppone!"
Viva Peppone!
<i>This is Counselor Stiletti,
<i>the only one elected
by the opposition.
<i>The other is Miss Cristina,
the towrs old teacher.
<i>She's 85 years old
and lives on memories.
<i>These two have
seen something from
<i>the window that
is the end of the world
<i>for them. Will she
wait to return home?
<i>No, she's not afraid.
She knows everyone.
<i>And she has bo xed all
their ears at least once.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
You can hear nothing!
Turn up the volume!
Everyone has to hear this!
<i>The final victory is near!
<i>Unite!
<i>Unite!
<i>The final victory is near!
<i>There, that's better.
You see that, Jesus? They
aimed their trumpet against us.
<i>What can you do, Don
Camillo? That's progress.
Good day, miss Cristina.
Who are you? -I'm Gina
Filotti. Don't you remember me?
Gina?
Goodness! Now I have to look up
to see you. I'm getting smaller.
You haven't changed. -I have.
Did you behave at boarding
school? -Yes, miss Cristina.
You're here on a
terrible day. Look there.
Comrades!
Comrades, before
giving the podium
to the comrade who
came from the city...
...to celebrate our triumph
for the people and democracy...
...I want to tell
you great news.
We will soon begin
building a Citizens' Center
which will have a
library with books,
a dance hall, a cinema, and
other cultural activities,
a gymnasium for physical
training and much more.
That will be your home!
A Center for the people!
A Citizens' Center! Where
will he get the money?
Now that I've given
you the wonderful news,
our delegate
comrade will speak.
Comrades, I'm here
to congratulate myself
and Comrade Giuseppe
Bottazzi, our friend Peppone,
for the rousing victory over
the enemies of the people!
Jesus, I'll make
a march on Rome!
<i>Stop. <i>This
doesn't concern you.
<i>Only in here can
you do what you want.
Here, I can?
-<i>Yes, this is your home.</i>
We'll crush the class
that's exploiting us!
You must stay within
the law, and we will,
at the cost of nailing all
enemies of the people to a wall!
Meanwhile...
Who is that? -Don Camillo.
-Make him be quiet!
You try. You'd have to aim
a cannon at the bell tower.
If he won't stop, we should
shoot him in the tower window.
You'd better kill him on the
first shot. He'll shoot back.
Why is he stopping?
Why is he letting them speak?
Is he one of them?
I've always said he
was a Bolshevik priest.
Isn't that Mariolino
carrying the flag?
Yes, it's him!
He's redder than his father
standing on the platform.
A nice family of criminals!
Comrades, did you hear?
We will no longer tolerate any
attempts on our freedom of speech!
Those who hide in the
shadow of the Cross
and who speak to
misguide the people
are the same ones who betrayed
Christ many centuries ago.
They're attacking the Church!
They must be stopped! I can't stay!
Gina, it's you!
You look great! Almost
like a grown woman.
What should I look like, a goat?
-You used to.
I'm busy now. May I see you tonight? -Go
on, ugly! Go join your band of brigands!
Better my brigands than
your damned priests!
Comrades, we have
another comrade!
Peppone! He's beautiful!
He looks like you!
<i>If Don Camillo is ringing the bells,
it's not to celebrate his victory.
<i>It is because he's happy
for his old enemy, Peppone.
<i>Their struggle
has gone on for years.
<i>They left for the war
together and returned together,
<i>always together
and always enemies.
<i>One night an old
abandoned house began to burn,
<i>and the whole town watched
dumbstruck as the stones burned,
<i>which logic would
tell you would not burn.
Listen.
I want to know how that
pile of rock is burning.
Stop, Don Camillo! Go back!
-Why are you interfering?
I'm not. It's silly to
put yourself in danger.
It's only rocks burning.
It stinks of petrol.
It could be...
It could be something else.
Like what? -I
don't know anything.
Do you believe that...?
-I don't believe anything.
You don't like your
flock to see you get
bravery lessons from an
old reactionary priest!
Stop! -Like hell!
Go water your flowers.
We'll see who is afraid.
Stop, Don Camillo!
It would have been better
to let you go ahead.
The world's most reactionary
priest would have blown up.
I'd have stopped
in time. -Why?
I knew that in the cellar
there were 6 barrels of petrol,
300 grenades, 95 rifles,
2 cases of ammunition,
7 machine guns, and
300 kilos of explosives.
I inventoried your
warehouse before I burned it.
I should kill you.
Kill me? That won't be easy.
You've actually
done me a favor.
That stuff was weighing
on my conscience.
You said there were 7 machine
guns, but there were 8.
Who took the other ones? -I did. When
the proletarian revolution begins,
stay far away from my church.
I'll see you in hell.
<i>This lasted for years.
<i>If Don Camillo
couldn't stomach
<i>the blows received
from an aggressor,
<i>Peppone couldn't forget
the way the cursed church bells
<i>had greeted his election.
<i>A few days later,
Matuggia, the sacristan...
What is it? Who's there?
-I don't know. I think...
What do you think?
-I saw... -Who?
Last night...
-Who do you mean?
I saw Peppone
leaving the church.
The Mayor? That's how he's
improving public places, eh?
I asked him to fix the
tower, but he's destroying it.
Why didn't you tell me? -I
thought he'd come for confession.
Confession? -Yes.
I'll give him
confession, all right!
<i>Don Camillo, put
that down.</i> -What?
<i>Put it down.
It's an ugly thing.
It's made of
poplar. It's light.
<i>Throw it away and
don't think about Peppone.
How can I forget him if you're
sending his wife to me now?
What is it? -A
baptism, Father.
Who is his mother? -I am!
Your husband is the father?
-Who should it be? You?
Why so angry? Doesrt your
party practice free love?
What will his name be?
Libero Antonio Lenin.
Let the Russians baptize him.
Let's go!
I really gave it to
those godless people.
<i>That was stupid. Call them
back and baptize the baby.
Jesus, you must keep in
mind that baptism is no joke.
<i>Don't explain baptism
to me. I invented it!
<i>The baby won't go
to heaven if he dies.
Why should he die?
He's pink and healthy.
I get it. I'm always wrong.
I'll try to call them back.
I'll leave when my son is
baptized with the name I want.
Town Hall is outside.
This is a church.
Careful, I have a
delicate stomach.
Do you remember that bullet I
took in the war? No low blows.
Don't worry, I'll get
you only on the top floor.
What time is it? -Who knows?
All right, you win.
That's for the baptism.
That's for the firecrackers.
What firecrackers?
-Don't play innocent.
That's what you do.
Destroy and burn.
And you want to build
a Citizens' Center!
Be quiet, you
little Bolshevik.
He's smarter than his father.
Where are you getting the
money for that building?
I'll find it.
If we have a drought,
you won't be able to
buy the first brick.
I know, I've been fighting
for a city park for 10 years.
But you don't want
it to cost anything.
Well, shall we
baptize this treasure?
What are we going to call him?
Libero Antonio Camillo.
Camillo, as well?
Yes. -If that's the case,
you can add Lenin, too.
Camillo cancels out
those other types.
Show me the baby.
<i>Ciro dell'Abbruciata,
Mariolino's grandfather,
<i>is the godfather.
<i>The Abbruciata farm is
as hard and bald as a squash.
<i>If you planted dynamite,
maybe it would grow.
<i>But Ciro and his son
insist on planting grain.
Mariolino!
Mariolino!
<i>On the farm, on the side
belonging to Gina's family,
<i>the earth is beautiful and only
a caress is needed for grain to grow.
<i>Poverty and wealth,
the sun and politics added,
<i>makes them
detest each other.
<i>And so a wall was
built to avoid trouble.
Are you crazy? My father
will kill me if he sees us.
Why didn't you come the other
day? I waited until night.
You told me to go away.
It was nothing. I was angry.
You're so handsome!
You're getting a beard!
You were running.
Your skin is boiling.
No, I wasnt running.
It prickles.
<i>There they are,
Romeo and Juliet.
<i>When they were babies,
their families became enemies.
<i>At that time, the
wall hadrt yet been built.
<i>The slightest incident
always complicated matters.
<i>The battle extended to
the mothers and fathers,
<i>then to the
rest of the family
<i>and finally to
the grandparents.
Your Peppone is a brigand!
That priest of yours makes
you want to turn Muslim.
You are a Muslim! Hypocrite!
Gina!
My grandfather! He'll
pull my hair out!
See you tonight.
See you tonight.
Here I am!
Gina!
Where were you? -I went to
see if the apples are ripe.
Apples won't help with
your exams. Go study!
That old pig let his
pigeons out again.
Killer! Assassin!
Do my pigeons bother you
passing over your land?
They block the sun!
The sun wasrt made
for old fools like you!
If you shoot again, I'll
set your hut on fire!
I shoot at whatever
passes over what's mine.
Here's your pigeon. It's
tough as iron. Take it!
Eat it! -You
rotten old buzzard!
Eat it, so it will strangle
you! -So you could cry over me!
Rotten buzzard!
<i>The pigeon
didn't go to waste.
<i>Gina brought it to Miss
Cristina who had a feast.
<i>Cristina had taught at
the town school for 50 years.
<i>When she retired, the people
had given her an alarm clock.
<i>So the old
teacher sets the alarm
<i>and continues hoping for
a pension from the government.
Who is it? -Scan'tassini.
Who are the others?
Friends of mine. We have
something important to say.
Come in.
Well, what is it? -Something
important happened.
There were elections,
and the Reds won.
The Reds are rotten people.
But we're the Reds!
-They're still rotten.
We know what we want politically,
and we really don't need anything,
but when it comes to administration,
you need to write, answer reports,
and you're the only one we
can turn to; paid, of course.
You'll pay me?
We can come from the fields
every night, and you can drill us.
Look at the reports,
correct our mistakes.
It's too late for you. You
should have studied long ago.
We were sent to the
fields instead of school.
The fault wasrt all ours.
Who are you?
Ah, Brusco
dell'Abbruciata. -Yes.
The same brat as always.
You're right, it
wasrt your fault.
Be seated!
Has Giuseppino gotten
all his teeth yet?
He's about to be married!
Is your sister-in-law
still nasty, Luigi?
She gets worse
as she gets older.
Get out!
Me?
You did me too many wrongs!
But you can't...
This rascal came to school
with pockets full of frogs.
One day he came to
school riding a cow!
But he's the Mayor!
Mayor or not, if
you don't leave
I'll cane you so hard,
you'll go bald! Go away!
I told you so. I played
a few too many on her.
You're never to
step foot here again,
even if you become
Minister of Education!
Peppone is an ass.
Peppone brought this to me
to type. He wants 15 copies.
Listen to this mess.
"First and last warning.
Last night, too, a
vicious anonymous hand
wrote an offensive insult
on our daily message board.
The hand of this
slob has to calm down.
He's exploiting our
work to provoke us.
If he doesn't stop, he'll
be sorry when it's too late.
Every patience has a limit.
Section Secretary, Giuseppe
Bottazzi, aka Peppone."
What provocation? Do you
know anything, Barchini?
Don't you know anything?
Every time they put up a
poster, it's full of blunders.
Someone always writes
"Peppone is an ass" above it.
Peppone is an ass,
and when one is an ass
and writes proclamations,
we all see that
he's an ass, right?
It's natural. The
people see and comment.
I have to make the copies now.
He wants them in the morning.
Good night.
Peppone is an ass.
<i>And what are you?
What am I? I don't
understand, Lord.
<i>Last night, when you
went to buy the cigar,
<i>the one you still have
half of in your pocket,
<i>didn't you perchance stop
and read the message board?
I didn't actually read
it. I only glanced at it.
<i>And didn't you notice
some strange writing?
When I stopped, there
was nothing written there.
I'm being called to
the sacristy, I think.
<i>Don Camillo, wait!
<i>And when you left, did you
notice anything strange there?
Now that you mention it,
there was something written
in red pencil on the bottom.
They're waiting for me.
<i>Shame on you, ridiculing a man
because he only reached third grade.
<i>The whole town is laughing at
him. Listen to what you've done.
Peppone is an ass.
Peppone is an ass!
Peppone is an ass!
-Peppone is an ass!
Peppone is an ass!
I didn't want that.
What should I do?
<i>Who sins must do penance.
Blessed Mother.
Don't call on those who
have nothing to do with it.
But she's still your mother!
-<i>Don Camillo!</i>
You judge me badly, Jesus.
Here's my half cigar.
You know I can't
buy another all week.
Look at what I'll do.
<i>Very good. I
accept your penance.
<i>Get rid of the crumbs.
You can smoke those in a pipe.
Good evening, Father.
Good evening, Mr. Mayor.
Not "Mayor", just a Christian.
I've come to confess.
God be with you.
You have more need than
anyone for His blessing.
How long since your
last confession?
It was 1918.
-1918!
You must have committed many
sins with all your bad ideas.
Yes, many.
Come with me.
<i>Peppone quickly told all,
<i>but the most difficult
to confess was his last sin.
Finally, it was
me a month ago,
when you were returning
with the basket of eggs,
who jumped on
you with a stick.
It was you!
I didn't hit you as a minister
of God, but as a political enemy.
10 Our Fathers
and 10 Hail Marys.
<i>Ego te absolvo
a peccatis tuis
<i>in nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
Amen.
Jesus, I'll pulverize him!
<i>No. I forgave
him, and so must you.
Jesus, if I'm a good
servant of God, let me
break this candle on
him. What's a candle?
<i>Your hands are for
blessing, not for striking.
My hands are made for
blessing. How about my feet?
All right. We're even. But I
haven't confessed everything.
But I already gave you
absolution. That's sacrilege.
They're not exactly sins.
Maybe just small errors.
Shouldrt you correct
your penitent's errors?
It's our duty.
-Good, here it is.
Citizens!
Citizens, while we salute
the glorious affirmation
of our list...
I won't answer for my actions!
<i>I'll answer. Do your duty.</i>
-Correcting Red propaganda?
<i>You'll work on his spelling,
which has no political color.
Come here with
your literature.
Here we are.
Good. But there's one
thing here where I wrote,
"We intend to enlarge
the school building",
you wrote, "We intend to
enlarge the school building
and repair the church
bell tower." Why?
It's a question of
grammatical rules.
Lucky for your bell tower
that you studied Latin.
It dampens my hope of
seeing it fall on your head.
We must kneel before
God's will. Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh, that rascal that's been
writing on your posters,
I think I know who it is.
I'll tell him to stop.
That would be a lot better for him.
I kept the stick I used that night.
Good night, Father.
-Good night, Mr. Mayor.
Is the Citizens'
Center moving along?
It's coming along.
Lord, they don't have enough
to buy the first stone.
<i>Where did you get
that cigar, Camillo?
Peppone had two. I think I
took it without asking him.
You know he believes in
equal distribution of wealth.
<i>Don Camillo can go back to
dreaming of his city park now
<i>because he's convinced
that Peppone was bluffing
<i>and that he really has no hope
of building a Citizens' Center.
Our comrade Mayor asks our
priest the honor of his presence
at the social ceremony
tomorrow morning at ten
in Piazza della Libertà.
What ceremony?
I don't know anything else.
No, I won't go.
Tell the comrade Mayor
I don't want to hear
the usual stupidities against
reactionaries and capitalists.
It's not political. It's all
patriotic, in a social way.
If you don't come, you don't
understand democracy! -I'll be there.
He said to come in uniform
and bring your tools.
What tools? -Your pail and
brush, so you can bless stuff.
But, but...
Social ceremony, indeed!
Comrades and fellow citizens:
I am happy to place this first
stone of the Citizens' Center
soon to rise here
in the heart of town,
symbol of our will toward
action and social progress.
Amen.
Our dear priest will
honor us with his words.
Dear friends, I would like
to express all the joy I feel
and the recognition
I owe to our Mayor
for inviting me
to this ceremony.
Thank you.
<i>Don Camillo lost sleep.
<i>How did Peppone
find that money?
<i>Finally, he
thought he'd guessed.
Do these hooves have the
honor of being the Mayor's?
Would you mind leaving
a worker in peace?
I wanted to
congratulate you on
the Citizens' Center.
I didn't have time on Sunday.
At public ceremonies one can
never say what one really thinks.
You can easily guess
what they'd say.
Not all of it.
Listen, brigand, make your
Citizens' Center smaller.
It costs too much, and
there's a more urgent matter.
Have you lost your mind?
I'm perfectly all there.
Do you remember when
you were a Partisan?
When you attacked that
escaping enemy convoy?
And that truck you captured,
the one carrying spoils of
war gold and the divisiors pay?
And that day you sent
comrades Brusco and Smilzo
to take the truck and
consign it to the authorities?
Poor guys! Remember
how they returned?
On foot and in bad condition.
Three tanks had attacked them!
And good-bye
truck full of gold.
What are you insinuating?
Nothing. Just that tonight I
dreamed there were no tanks,
and the truck was never lost.
You never change!
You always try to dishonor us!
Don't yell. You
could burst a vein.
Poor Peppone, your memory
is gone. Try to remember.
This is a fully legal
receipt and statement.
With the capture of that truck,
we earned 10 million lire.
It was entirely spent on the
people. No one touched a cent.
If someone has anything
to say, I can fix them.
So can I.
Priest, I don't think
there's a reason to fight.
I don't, either.
But we agree, anyway.
10 million gained
for the people,
that is, 7 million
for the Center,
and 3 million for a park
for the people's children.
<i>Sinite parvulos
venire ad me.
7 million plus 3
equals 10 million.
I only ask what is due to me.
<i>And in his turn, Don
Camillo placed the first stone
<i>in his famous city park.
<i>But the two building sites in
town couldn't give work to everyone.
<i>Poverty was great.
<i>The workers expected Peppone
to relieve their problem.
<i>He called together the
richest landowners in Town Hall,
<i>but they hid
behind the law.
<i>They said it wasrt their
fault things were going badly.
And the bridge we're
building over the ditch?
And the 5-kilometer
irrigation canal?
There's work for everyone,
but the town has no money.
This is what I've
decided to do:
A land tax of 1,000
lire to finance the work.
If you agree, it's okay.
If you don't agree, you'll have
to deal with the hungry people.
<i>1,000 lire was a hefty sum.
<i>It was the same as a
million for old Filotti.
<i>His refusal to pay provoked
the others into agreement.
Then I'll have to order
a farm worker's strike.
We'll see who'll
work your land.
<i>Work stopped on
all the land in town.
<i>One day, the bellowing
of Filotti's cows
<i>could be heard for a kilometer.
The strike picketers stopped everyone
<i>from feeding and
milking the livestock.
Hey!
Where are you going? -To
milk my cows and feed them.
I have that right, no? -It's not won'th
it. The picket guard won't let you.
You're proud of what you
do, pleased with yourself.
It's cruel to those animals.
Their udders are hard as rocks
with days milk. Shame on you!
Castaldi's wife
has no milk, either.
She can't nurse since
her husband lost his job.
They had to put the
baby in a charity home.
And she's not the
only hungry one.
There's no other way. If the
cows have to die, they will!
Do you think there
is any place on earth
where people can be peaceful?
There must be. I'm sure of it.
Or life wouldn't
be won'th living.
Hey, you! Stop!
Where are you going?
-Be careful with that thing.
It's forbidden to go further.
I have to. Listen to
my cow. She's calving.
She'll die without my help.
I have to go. That calf
is being born today.
Gisella's son says
Gigiotti's grapes are rotting.
I know. Brusco
told my husband.
Peppone's doubling the
picketers with city people.
They're bringing machine guns!
-This is the end of the world!
They wouldn't let him in.
Mariolino wanted to shoot him!
Shoot whom? -Giacomo,
Filotti's old cowman.
The red cow who's
calving is going to die!
And so are the others
with udders like that
and nothing in their bellies!
Jesus, there has to be a
limit. -What scoundrels!
May God punish them!
-Send them all to hell!
Quiet, you old madwomen!
The selfish, stubborn
owners are responsible, too.
May God send Filotti and his
peers to hell with no pity.
Pardon me, Jesus.
I believe I'm angry.
You won't send anyone to hell.
But letting them die
like this is stupid!
Jesus!
-Let's go! -Let's go away!
Lord, don't let anyone jump
on me on the other side.
Who's there?
Answer, or I'll shoot.
Careful, or I'll shoot back.
You're involved in this,
too. It seemed strange.
Hear that music?
If those cows die,
you'll have more jobless.
That's the curse
of farm towns.
In the city, they only have to close
the shops. Machines don't need milking.
And you can't put a dead
cow back on its legs.
Stay here.
Stop, or I'll turn
you into a sieve.
Peppone's stubborn as a mule,
but he won't shoot a priest
obeying God's word in his back.
Who's there?
Stop that. It's me, Peppone.
Go take a walk. It
will wake you up.
You want to turn this
beautiful stall into a cemetery?
Hurry up, go in there!
I'll take care of the red
cow. You get the hay to them.
We'll milk them later.
Shut up! -I won't shut up!
<i>They worked like mules.
<i>And when it was done...
<i>... it was necessary
to wait for night.
Jack, cavalier and king!
I'm so hungry, I
could eat a bishop!
They're hard to digest.
To your health!
They're not bellowing.
They must be dying.
They'll all die.
Hey! Go to town and buy
50 liters of disinfectant!
Okay.
-Others will die before I do.
<i>When God willed,
the strike ended,
<i>and life returned
to the fields.
<i>The city strikers
arrived when it was all over.
What about the strike?
-It's over. -Over?
What did we come here for?
<i>March ahead, folks, to
revolt Red flag, red flag
<i>It was hot, so there was
only one thing for them to do:
<i>Have a good drink.
Look, there's a priest racing!
Hey, Bartali!
Hey, you speed merchant!
Careful with your skirt!
We agree that the city
boys didn't behave well,
but he pulverized
15 of them. 15!
Excellency, you must admit
the town cannot have this.
A priest shouldn't
behave like a steamroller.
I understand.
I see he is a
danger to the town.
A change of parish priests
is inevitable. Excuse me.
We'll send you Don
Pietro. -Don Pietro?
That young man you saw.
He won't bother you.
That half pint? -Mr. Mayor!
Pardon, but if I punch
that little priest,
I'll send him flying meters.
If I punch Don Camillo, he
doesn't move a centimeter.
Why do you have to punch him?
That little priest
is church material.
Once you get him robbed, he must
look like a coat rack wearing a cape.
Do you measure a priest's
won'th in size and weight?
No, we're not savages, but
the eye needs its share, too.
What we mean is... -Shut up.
What we mean is we don't
want Don Camillo taken away,
but to make him
stay in his place,
make him stop doing politics
and to mind his own business.
A brain washing, so to speak.
All right, I think you deserve
that. -Thank you, Excellency.
Church pews werert enough?
Now you throw tables, too.
In a moment of weakness, I...
I know, but a man of God
preaches love and kindness
and does not throw tables
on his neighbors' heads.
For shame!
Don't try to tell me you were
alone! You prepared an ambush, right?
One man can't beat 15 others.
Excellency, I was
alone, I swear it.
The table dropped
on them and...
It was like that
one. -Like that one?
Go on, lift it!
What? -Lift it!
It's time to show
what you can do.
If you're telling
the truth, prove it!
Come on!
Throw it!
What do you mean? -Throw it!
My poor Don Camillo, you
will never be a bishop.
Excellency, are you hurt?
No, nothing
happened. It was me.
Don Camillo made me angry,
and I lost my temper.
<i>Don Camillo got a pardon
<i>and a promise that the Bishop
would come and inaugurate his park.
<i>The Citizens'
Center slowly rose.
Is the archpriest
looking for something?
I was passing by.
The Center isn't going
up so fast, Mr. Mayor!
It's a Center,
not a dirigible!
I'll inaugurate
it in three weeks.
Inaugurate what?
-The city park.
You haven't even started
work on that swamp.
You're spying on me.
-No, I'm just observing.
Then you know the ball
field is ready to inaugurate.
What is this,
monthly payments?
Arert you
inaugurating this hut?
Don't get angry. I am not
having inauguration ceremonies.
I came to propose
a soccer match
between your "Dynamos"
and my "Braves".
Do you want to open
your field with a defeat?
Do you agree?
I agree. You'd better
train your little girls.
Will you come to the
procession, Mr. Mayor?
I've never missed a
blessing of the river.
I'll be there with the whole
Party section, waving a flag.
Not your flag!
Why, does red hurt your eyes?
This is a religious, not
a political procession.
Come without the flag, or don't
come at all. -You're not II Duce.
Look at what I
do to dictators.
Careful, you'll demolish
your Center that way.
<i>Because he could
not come with his flag,
<i>Peppone decided to
boycott the procession.
<i>The town was warned
that whoever values his skin
<i>should not go.
They're capable
of throwing a bomb!
The procession
should be cancelled.
Do as you wish, I don't care.
What's going on?
I think we'd better go home.
Good-bye, Father.
-Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye, Don Camillo.
Go home. This is
none of your business.
<i>Well, are we
going, Don Camillo?
<i>The river must be
beautiful in this sunshine.
<i>I'd really like to see it.
Let's go, Lord.
They could have made
this cross a bit lighter.
<i>Tell me! I had to haul it up a
hill, and I don't have your back.
Get lost!
Get lost!
-<i>Leave him alone.</i>
<i>This way Peppone can't say
<i>that not even a dog
came to the procession.
Jesus, hold on tight.
We're going to fight.
I'm not moving aside
for you, but for Him.
Then take off your hat.
Jesus, if the few honest
homes in this filthy town
could float like Noah's Ark,
I'd say, "Make the river overflow
its banks and drown this town."
But, as the honest people live in
the same homes as the criminals,
you can't punish everyone
because of Peppone
and his godless
and lawless gang.
So I pray you save them from
flood and bring prosperity. Amen.
Amen.
<i>It was necessary for Jesus
to guard the river's calm.
<i>When angered, it
caused grave damages.
<i>A hat was found
here once in a hollow.
<i>The river had drowned
it along with the sacristan.
<i>The sacristan was Miss
Cristina's grandfather,
<i>and so, on
every anniversary...
You'll leave the family
when you become a teacher.
You may even leave this town.
I'll work where you
are, and we'll marry.
When I'm a teacher... Why
not when I have white hair?
Arert two years too long?
Two years, a hundred years...
You can wait, right?
Is that how you love me?
I don't want you to cry.
And all this time, we've had
to see each other secretly.
If we're caught, your nasty
father will break your head.
And your dirty grandfather
will lock you up in a convent!
If he did, I'd
burn the convent!
That's the best way
to accommodate things.
Miss Cristina!
We're so unappy.
-You're mostly stupid!
Did you have to choose
a convent burner?
And couldn't you choose one
of the crazies in your gang?
We didn't choose.
We found each other.
You're not only
stupid, you're unlucky.
Help us, miss Cristina.
Did you hear the
bell? -What bell?
The one in the
submerged church.
It brings bad luck.
Does a future teacher
believe such nonsense?
I didn't think you were
backwards. -I'm not backwards!
Tell him, miss Cristina.
Tell this fool it's true.
It rang when Tolli
drowned in '86.
It rang when the girl jumped
from the bridge in '94.
The last time was
in 1912. -Listen!
It's thunder! Can't
you see the clouds?
Do you think so?
This silly boy is
right this time.
Are those filthy pants the new
political way of showing legs?
I'm playing soccer!
The game! Who knows
what will be now?
See you later, Gina.
Good-bye, miss Cristina.
He's not a bad boy.
I'll speak to his father
and your grandfather.
If they insist, I'll
give them a good caning.
These old idiots deserve it!
We want the game!
We want the game!
Where were you?
-I... -Shut up!
We'll talk after the game.
Attention!
I only want to say one thing.
You're playing against
the reactionary team.
You have to win, or
I'll break your heads!
Attention!
My dear boys, listen well.
I make no threats, but
if there is one among you,
some brigand who doesn't fight
to the last drop of blood,
I'll pulverize your behinds.
I am strictly
neutral politically.
I have never been
political in my life.
You may all count
on my impartiality.
I beg you to remember that
only sport is done here.
We are not in Town Hall.
If there's no
corruption, we'll win.
Where were you?
-At Aunt Marisa's.
No! Dammit!
Goal!
That can't be a goal!
That's the result
of your propaganda!
<i>At the end of
the first half,
<i>there were no dead on
the field or in the stands.
<i>Don Camillo's team
had scored two goals
<i>and hoped to
win two to one.
If you don't score in
the first five minutes,
I'll rip out your gut and
wrap it around your neck!
Goal!
I knew it would end like
this! Don't be upset!
<i>A few minutes from the
end, the teams were even.
Hey!
Referee!
That's not a penalty!
Traitor! Shouldrt I be angry?
Goal!
Shame on you!
Jesus, why didn't you help?
-<i>Why should I help you?</i>
<i>Your men have 22 legs.
Their men have 22 legs.
<i>I take care of
souls, not legs.
Did you look at that
lousy referee's soul?
He gave them a foul that
we should have gotten.
They want to kill me! Save me!
Go back, or I'll break your
heads! This is a sacred place.
Shame on you! Go back to your
caves, and may God forgive you.
Make the sign of the Cross.
Hurry up!
The sign of the Cross stands
between you and this man.
It's sacrilege to violate the
sacred barrier. Leave here!
<i>Vade retro!
Now to us. May God
punish you if you lie.
What did Peppone
pay you so he'd win?
2,500 lire.
Get out! Criminal! Snake
in the grass! Traitor!
Don't I have
reason to be angry?
Didrt I tell you
he could be bought?
<i>Who offered that man 2,000
lire for the same service?
Who can hide
anything from you?
<i>You bribed him, and
you deserved to lose.
I accept that as penance,
but seeing a team like that
lose, a team of real champions,
it breaks your heart,
it cries for revenge!
<i>Camillo!</i> -You can't
understand me. Sport is special.
You either understand
what I mean, or you don't.
<i>I understand
you all too well.
<i>When is the rematch?</i>
-Rematch?
It will be 5-0! They won't
even see the ball! -<i>Goal!</i>
<i>A few days later, old
Filotti called for Don Camillo
<i>to speak to him
of an urgent matter.
I need your
spiritual assistance.
Why? What did she do?
I did nothing
wrong. -Be quiet!
Answer only when you're asked!
How long has it been?
Since he made a hole in the
wall. It was right at face level.
We must have been
4 or 5 years old.
A hole in the wall. I'll
put a hole in that creep!
Let's not exaggerate.
Who is the creep?
Mariolino dell'Abbruciata!
-That anti-Christ?
The one who scored two goals
and wrecked half my team?
If your poor dead father knew
you were with a Red, he'd die!
Red or not, we're
getting married!
That's no way. She's too
old now to be slapped.
Think now, this Mariolino
isn't the creep you believe.
He's the flag bearer
for those mad dogs!
You're the mad dogs,
and whose fault is that?
Poverty drives them.
Old greedy men like you!
Miss Cristina said
you're a Bolshevik priest!
I won't listen to you. Go away.
You go to your room!
You'll leave it when
you return to school.
<i>For weeks Mariolino
heard nothing of Gina.
<i>One day he decided to
ask for Cristina's help,
<i>but Cristina had
fallen in her doorway
<i>under the weight
of her 85 years.
Is she feeling better now?
-No, she called for the priest.
She wants to see the Mayor,
too. -The Mayor? Peppone?
What can she
want from Peppone?
Would you like me to
confess a lot of filth?
No, dear priest,
there is none.
I called because I want
to die with a clean soul.
So I'll tell you. In 1942, your
dog, the one with the chopped tail,
came into my garden and
broke a pot of geraniums.
I forgive you. -I forgive you
for calling me a Bolshevik.
That's unnecessary.
I called you a Bolshevik,
like I called Peppone an ass.
Now, dear Cristina, to clean
what you call your soul,
you must confess if you
want to go to heaven.
I'm sure I'm going to heaven.
That's the sin of arrogance.
No mortal is sure of heaven.
No one, except
for Miss Cristina.
Because Jesus came and
told her she'd go to heaven.
So Miss Cristina is
sure she's going there,
unless you know
more than Jesus does.
I...
Ah, there you are! I forgive you
for the frogs you brought to school.
I know you're not
as bad as you seem.
I'll ask God to
forgive your murders.
Miss Cristina, I've
never murdered anyone.
Don't lie. Your people sent
away the King and his children
to a deserted island
to die of hunger.
Don Camillo, tell
her that's not true.
There were no desert
islands, no dying of hunger.
They were lies.
It wasrt only us. The
elections sent him away, too.
He had more votes
against him than in favor.
That's how democracy works.
What democracy? Kings
are never sent away.
You are the Mayor.
Listen to my testimony.
Neither the house nor
the furnishings are mine.
Give my clothing to the poor.
You may keep my books
if you have need of them.
You must do the exercises
and study your verbs well.
Yes, ma'am.
I want a funeral without music.
Death is a serious matter.
I want a funeral as
in civilized times,
with a flag on my casket.
-Yes, ma'am.
My flag. The one there,
hanging on the wall.
My flag with the
King's insignia.
Yes, ma'am.
God bless you, my son,
even if you're a Bolshevik.
I think I have
another thing to do.
That young couple...
I have no more time.
God will take care of it.
You now have heard
her last wishes.
As we are in a
democratic republic,
I will ask the major
parties their opinion.
The reactionaries
can keep quiet,
because we know you'd
enjoy a funeral enormously.
You'd like the Royal
March to be played, too.
In honor of one person,
we cannot disrespect
the memory of 100,000
men who died to
establish the Republic.
I oppose the royal flag's
display at the funeral.
The time of
sentimentalism is over.
If she wanted the royal flag,
she should have died sooner.
We don't agree
with the lightness
in which the memory of a
venerated person is taken.
On the other hand, if
we respect her wishes,
we risk provoking incidents
which could offend her memory.
Therefore, we are also contrary to
the use of the incriminating flag.
What do you say, Father?
Before speaking, I will
hear the Mayor's opinion.
As Mayor, I must
approve your decision,
but in this town it is not the Mayor
who commands, but the Communists.
As Party Leader, I say
your opinion stinks.
Miss Cristina will go to
the cemetery with her flag.
I respect her more dead
than all of you alive.
If anyone objects, I'll
throw him out of the window.
Does our priest
have anything to say?
I concede to violence.
<i>Things happen in that town
<i>where the sun hammers
down on people's heads.
<i>Fists may be used to reason,
but the dead are still respected.
Come in!
Gina!
What is it at this hour?
-We want to be married.
Weddings require two
people. -There are two of us.
Why are you here, Mr.
Cominform emissary?
I told you he'd get
political. Let's go.
No, let's stay.
What happened to you? -His family jumped
on him when they saw him signaling me.
Damned Bolsheviks! -Your people
are so nice. They beat you, too!
You're a bunch of hypocrites!
Godless! I'll marry you
to scratch your eyes out!
I'll marry you,
so I can smack you!
Stop that, or I'll
beat both of you!
The priest, my grandfather,
him, everybody beats me!
What did I do?
Calm down and tell
me what you want.
We want to be married, now!
-You can't.
She's underage. There's a
law. You need parental consent.
Right, our parents
will murder us instead.
Let me think. I'll come
up with something tomorrow.
Marry us tonight! -Impossible.
In a few days. It won't kill you.
We'll see.
Why do you have to
marry this late at night?
I've never seen a
couple in such a hurry.
We can't leave town
without getting married.
When we're legal,
we're taking a train!
I can't. -You're
the Mayor, right?
You're underage. You
need parental consent.
They'd rather kill us!
We have to study the law.
There may be a loophole.
I'll go to Town Hall
tomorrow and see.
Meanwhile, you can sleep
in my truck for tonight,
and you with my mother.
I'm not sleeping anywhere
if I'm not married.
If we can't marry,
we'll marry anyway,
and you'll hear bells.
Come with me, Mariolino.
They're crazy!
-You're the crazy one.
You men are all alike.
Didrt you understand?
What didn't I understand?
-They're doing something stupid.
Maybe they have already.
It's not so serious.
They are capable of throwing
themselves in the river.
Didrt you hear her say
that we'd hear bells?
What bells?
The bell in the river...?
You think that...?
Those idiots! If I catch them,
I'll make them forget about...
They'll hear the bells ring.
And may they all be cursed.
Don't curse anyone when
you're about to die.
She's going to kill herself.
I knew when I saw the letter.
It said, "If we
cannot be married..."
My poor Gina!
You have to find them!
Do something! Move!
Gina and Mariolino went to
the swamp! Ring the bells!
We need lanterns! I'll take the
woods! You, the river's edge!
Oh, Jesus, protect them!
If something happened
to them, God won't forgive any of you.
-You could have married them!
What about you? All you
needed was an "Oremus".
Stop! Stop there!
Behave yourselves!
Calm down, for goodness' sake!
Leave me alone!
Listen to me!
The banns will be made,
and they'll be married.
Refuse authorization,
and I'll break your heads.
You're not in command here!
Stop! Settle your
arguments here and now.
Do you want to fight? -Yes!
Then fight once and for all!
Get the wedding clothes.
The Bishop will marry them.
The Bishop? -Yes!
What do you think,
Bolshevik? Go!
Now let's get some sleep.
Mr. Mayor, what a coincidence!
I'm here because I
have something to say.
Look, he's hiding.
Who? -Your friend, Smilzo.
What's he doing with the pen?
If he draws crows,
I'll hunt him down.
People who write on
walls aren't my friends.
Now I know that, Mr. Mayor.
You see enemies everywhere.
I want... -Come in. I'm painting,
too. You can give me a hand.
Are you getting
ready for Christmas?
Christmas always arrives
sooner than expected.
I just came to tell you
that you have some nerve.
Get that brush up there.
Do you take me
for a sacristan?
Inaugurating the park
on the kids' wedding day
is one of your criminal blows.
This way the Bishop
can bless the kids
and solemnize the
family reconciliation.
That will make it appear that you did
everything and turned water into wine.
All to your benefit!
So inaugurate the Center, too.
You know it needs
another week to be done.
A gentleman wouldn't do this.
The Virgin doesn't
have a moustache!
Look how beautiful.
This is Peppone's baby,
Peppone's wife,
and this is Peppone.
And this is Don Camillo.
So, will you delay the
inauguration for a few days?
Then it will all be ready,
and we'll do it together.
All right. Animals always
understand one another.
<i>The great day
finally arrived.
I don't understand. The
Bishop is always on time.
Have you seen the
Mayor this morning?
I want to know
what's happening here.
<i>What happened was this:
<i>Peppone was trying
to win this last contest.
No, leave it there, so we
can put it together fast.
He'll have to use the bridge.
He'll be half an hour late.
But we'll get to the
Citizens' Center in minutes,
and we'll inaugurate
it before he does.
Fine! -Right!
Watch out, here he is!
Hurry! Take your places!
Remember, dignified
indifference.
An accident? -We
don't know, Excellency.
It's the Mayor!
Excellency! It's
only a breakdown.
I see. Can I help you? -I
don't think so, Excellency.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
At my age, legs betray you.
Good day, my sons. It seems
there is nothing to do.
I'll walk there, very slowly.
I won't risk falling.
You're very robust.
Good morning!
There he is!
He's walking!
Walking?
He's with Peppone!
Pay attention, now!
Excellency, we were
waiting for you here.
Don't be upset. I
wanted to take a walk.
The Mayor and his
friends accompanied me.
They are all very kind!
Hi, Dad.
Accept these humble flowers
with love from our hearts.
How sweet. You're very
good. What is your name?
He's my son Marco.
He's as nice as his father.
Yes, he is.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Will we begin now? -Yes.
I'm sorry,
Excellency. I must go.
Why the hurry?
I'm inaugurating the
Citizens' Center in minutes.
People are waiting for me.
A Citizens' Center?
Don Camillo didn't tell me.
-But I...
It would be an honor if you
came, Excellency. Please come.
Of course.
-And the city park, Excellency?
There's time later for that.
-And the wedding?
They have their whole
lives ahead of them.
Here we have two
meeting halls.
Here's the
gymnasium, the garden.
It's magnificent,
and very useful.
The Mayor should show
you his weapons warehouse.
I'm sure it's not as
well supplied as yours.
Don Camillo has a
mortar buried somewhere.
Didrt I tell you
he's a dangerous man?
You wanted him, so keep him.
This is your
theatre. -Thank you.
Have a seat.
What a big turnout!
I'm happy to see
so many people here,
and I'm glad I visited
this beautiful place
with all these useful and
pleasant things inside.
You're lucky to have
one who cares for you.
I must leave you now.
I must see the beautiful
park which completes all this.
Good-bye, my sons.
Good-bye, Excellency.
-Good-bye, Mr. Mayor.
<i>The town had the joy of
forgetting its wounds that day.
<i>There were no more Reds opposed to
Blacks, only good people having fun.
How is it going, Papa Filotti?
Well, it's going!
Watch out! -All right, sorry.
<i>While the Bishop
napped, Don Camillo...
Well, you know.
Bravo!
Well done!
I wanted to even the score.
That thing couldn't
trick me anymore.
The hinge is blocked.
The usual Vatican move.
Let's go, Maria.
<i>Political passions
inflamed later that day,
<i>and the people
began to argue.
<i>Unfortunately, Don Camillo
got involved in the debate, too.
Poor Don Camillo, I think
you need a change of air.
You must go to the
countryside for a rest.
The mountain air
will be good for you.
<i>You'll miss the train,
Don Camillo.</i> -Do you think so?
<i>It's an express. It won't
wait more than a few minutes.
Just one minute more. -<i>Poor
Camillo, you know they won't come.</i>
I hoped someone would
have the courage.
<i>Peppone made his
threats in every home today.
I know. He said if he saw
anyone come to say good-bye,
he'd break his bones.
But I thought
that maybe someone!
Just one of them.
<i>Men are men. Remember
Peter. He betrayed me.
I'm a poor fool.
All right, I'll go.
I'm sorry I can't
take you with me.
<i>You know I'll
be with you anyway.
They'll be at the station.
Maybe in the piazza.
Good-bye, Father.
Have a good trip.
Here, Father! All the best!
Come back soon, Father.
Good-bye, Father.
Have a good trip.
Thank you. -They're old dell'Abbruciata
pigeons. I caught them in a trap.
Thank you, my sons.
Peppone's men said if they saw
anyone in town say good-bye,
they'd beat us up.
So we came here to
avoid trouble. -Yes.
Good-bye.
-Good-bye. Thank you!
My husband doesn't
know, but good-bye!
Good-bye. -Good-bye.
-Bon voyage!
Thank you for everything!
Bon voyage, Don Camillo!
Before leaving our
communal territory,
the people wished to
offer their regards
and express the hope that you
will repose in your new residence.
And you will return soon
to your spiritual mission.
I couldn't let us look bad
in front of the reactionaries,
those pillars of your church!
But we are not savages.
You behaved like bandits.
And you? You fought 12
men and beat them all!
I'm sorry I didn't
break your head, too.
We'll fix that
when I get back.
I'll take care of that
weakling priest in your place.
He won't get very far.
Oh, here.
My son Marco drew it.
The boy is talented!
Really!
Too bad he has a
father like you.
Anyway, God keep you.
May He keep you as well.
And make you easier
to handle. If possible.
<i>Here's the town in a corner
