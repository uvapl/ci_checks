Careful, you'll scratch it.
It's a family heirloom!
Not that, it's priceless. Paul!
Take what you want,
we have no choice.
BAILIFFS
You've taken almost nothing.
Try harder!
Like what?
I've taken everything I can unload.
Your TV's worthless,
you don't have a VCR...
Unless you're hiding it?
No way, come off it!
Well, I guess I could take the microwave.
Go for it.
You're more attached
to my possessions than I am.
They're objects.
You have to rise above them.
I should note that, it's good.
- Patrick, I need your feedback!
- I'm completely booked.
I want numbers!
Viagra sales are up across the board.
Like all prescription drugs
except Zitrax and Accutan.
- Won't be long.
- Head office will nab you.
Enough flattery.
I was stroked all weekend.
I want numbers!
Antidepressants are up 10%
in the East.
12% in Ontario.
Even more here.
And out West.
Worst drought in 50 years.
Wonderful!
- I shot an 81 at the Royal on Sunday.
- Keep it up!
I called 10 times.
Do you get your messages?
Big deal, a few less bills to pay.
Where the hell's Dad?
He left Rome two days ago.
He gave me the wrong flight number.
Any cranberry juice left?
Look for yourself.
I'm not your maid.
Ladies...
Is that your dad?
What's he written?
One novel in 30 years.
But what a novel!
Kids, go play downstairs! I said go!
- Why are you here?
- Do some washing.
- I have guests.
- I'll just take a dip.
No, you'll put
your clothes in the washer and leave.
What did he seize?
Some furniture and your bicycle.
It was your bike or my laptop.
Sorry.
Hi there!
Okay kids, time for bed.
I'll tuck you in.
What's with this fucking music?
Relax!
These are my colleagues.
For once people are having a good time.
It's Dad!
LIFE WITH MY FATHER
You lost a lot of weight,
but you look good.
Cut it out.
I'm losing my hair.
And I even lost a tooth.
Okay, we set a reasonable price
and add 30%.
Not that again.
He wants to sell the house.
I have no choice.
How much can I get?
Five. Eight if we renovate.
What? It's worth way more.
I'm talking to Dad.
- They got 1.6 next door.
- What do you know about money?
Fuck you too!
Finished your bickering?
Don't expect me to renovate.
If I don't finish my novel
I lose my grant.
Moocher lives off my tax dollars.
I'm offering you a real job.
You can do your dreaming at night.
Nothing like manual labor
to make the writing juices flow.
On that note, gentlemen,
I'll drive you home.
We'll pick up my girlfriend
from work.
What is he doing, Christ?
It's legal, it's clean.
Need any speed?
Have any Viagra?
No problemo!
- They're still in their packs.
- That's okay.
Yo, Washington!
You ready?
One waitress didn't show.
I'll be at least another two hours.
Why's he here?
I told you to stay away.
C'mon, their dessert's ready.
- I'll finish my smoke.
- Later.
Okay fine, finish it.
This time it's for good.
That's it.
You're out of a job.
I won't take you back.
I won't take you back!
- I'm going to bed.
- Already?
I don't get up at noon.
One of you has to work.
Where are the Delaunays?
You've been living off them.
I sold the bronze, too.
At least you guys are here!
Get away!
Christ!
Get away!
Get away, bloody cur!
Water's brown, how do you drink it?
We drink wine!
Try the bathroom tap.
- How about a nice Clape Cornas?
- Perfect!
FRANCOIS AGIRA
ARRIVES IN PARIS
Are you staying or taking off
for another six months?
I'll stay a bit.
How's the writing?
I'm blocked.
When I sit down at the computer...
I go blank.
Forget reality.
See where the words take you.
I can't start
if I don't have the ending.
I started my best sentences
not knowing
how I was going to end them.
What if they don't end?
Dammit!
Close the door, I'm getting cold.
Don't stay there watching, come in.
I'll soap you!
Paul!
Your dad's ogling me
and jerking off!
I can't believe it.
I'm sorry, truly sorry.
What's the idea?
Put yourself in my shoes.
I go to shave, and she's there.
I was surprised, I froze.
What I saw wasn't frozen.
Honestly, Paolo.
What would you have done
in my shoes?
Pa, she's my girlfriend!
I know, it's taboo.
I mean, I almost had an erection.
You weren't excited?
No, sure, I was excited!
But...
I haven't got hard in a month.
Okay.
The majority of adults 40-80
have sex at least once a week.
- 85% of men...
- But only 60% of women...
state that sex
is very important in their lives.
Look at you. I feel ashamed.
Relax, I took a shower.
I even got changed.
While sex is linked to health,
many people don't know
their state of health.
I want numbers!
Only 50% say they've seen a doctor
in the last year.
30% don't remember their last visit.
Supports our Alzheimer data.
Where we eating?
I can't take a bum
somewhere half-decent.
Numbers, gimme numbers!
Barely 20% of men
talk openly about their problem.
30% confuse
impotency and depression.
Revenue Quebec, $22,500.
- We'll go to McDonald's.
- Not McDonald's!
It's all about
the essence of male hood.
I eat pasta all week,
buy me a real meal!
We have six months
to come up with a marketing plan.
I want something
very aggressive, masculine!
Impotency will be on everyone's lips.
You look like a squeegee.
Damn cheapskate,
it's a tactic to save yourself money.
It's such a turn-on, you've no idea!
It's why I studied pharmacology,
to help people!
- Where can we go?
- I dunno.
A restaurant you take doctors to.
We want to rekindle people's dreams,
sell the idea of rebirth.
- Something cutting edge.
- A website.
Good. Men spend all day surfing,
to get hard.
Brainstorm!
Like-A-Rock. Com!
Unlimited-Supply. Com.
L-Want-To-Come-Come-Come. Com!
- Another summons. What's it for?
- A ticket, probably.
Taxes... they can wait.
That's why we need to sell the house.
I wanted to talk about that.
Why don't you take Dad in for now?
He'd be happier.
He's getting on.
You have a big guest room.
Macha and I are having problems.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Then a mediator would be ideal
to bring the two parties together.
Dad will break the ice.
I bet he saves your marriage.
I don't think so.
I have a schedule for the repairs.
First the roof.
Then you can redo the balcony.
We can put it up for sale
in January, easy.
- Why not wait till spring?
- In winter!
We won't have to redo the landscaping.
The inspector may not even
go on the roof.
You'll clear $8 an hour.
- I knew you'd grouse.
- An MA in philosophy's worth $20.
What can a philosopher do
besides eat up half my salary?
I'll make it $10.
Sign here.
It stipulates I get back
whatever money I lay out plus 4%.
Why 4%?
Inflation.
I don't want to be out of pocket.
Sign.
What more do you want to know?
How much time I have left.
When did this problem begin?
I've had it on and off for a year.
But last week I hit rock bottom.
Tell me.
I was in Venice,
the city of romance par excellence!
With an absolutely amazing woman.
An opera singer,
the first mezzo-soprano at La Scala.
But she was my Waterloo.
She could've stimulated me,
but she wouldn't risk her vocal cords!
I was tiny, truly tiny,
completely shriveled.
How many men leave
a perfectly good woman
just because they're ashamed?
Or because they don't have
what it takes?
It's too easy to blame the woman.
After 2000 years of slavery,
they go along with it.
- But you have to make them come!
- So true.
Before, if I liked a woman,
I just did it.
Now my main concern is to find out
if she's clitoral or vaginal.
After sex, I no longer simply feel good.
I'm happy I lived up to expectations.
I'll prescribe you something.
If it's to delay the inevitable, forget it.
I want to face the beast alone,
my head held high.
Go out in a blaze of glory,
in full possession of my faculties.
Alright, get undressed
and I'll take a look.
Not a rectal examination!
There's no other way for me
to check your prostate.
I'm embarrassed, you're a friend.
I spoke to the other waitresses.
It's more common than I thought.
I hope you didn't name names.
Everyone I asked knew someone
it had happened to.
- It's no big deal.
- It's been a month!
I didn't ask for details,
but like I say, it's widespread.
There must be an explanation.
You should get a second opinion.
More pasta?
Let me give you a hand.
You,
sit down.
This is my thanks?
You can stuff your life insurance
and pension plans.
- How'll you live?
- My royalties check.
- The government will seize it.
- We'll see!
Maybe it's time you let me
handle your finances.
Don't start!
I have an MBA.
Why not let me take over?
I'll be left with it when you die.
Damn manipulator,
you just want total control!
You'll never control my money, you hear?
I'll manage by myself.
Fuck!
Don't swear.
Do we let the air out of the tires?
It won't help. We have to break it.
If I can find my tool...
Careful with Mom.
Another task I'll inherit.
When will you finally bury her?
Like to inherit this?
A 1990 Chave Hermitage.
<The Wine Spectator> rated it 98,
3 stars in <The Hachette. >
You're the kind who'd auction them off.
Absolutely!
You'll get nothing.
See that?
Remember.
It may come in useful one day.
Gimme Mom.
The lover and father
who get rid of the son...
I should note that, it's good.
"A kiss, when all is said -
what is it?
"An oath that's ratified,
"a sealed promise, a heart's avowal
claiming confirmation,
"A rose-dot
on the 'i' of 'adoration,'
"A secret whispered
to mouth, not ear,
"Brush of a bee's wing,
that makes time eternal,
"Communion perfumed
like wild flowers,
"The heart's relieving
in the heart's out breathing,
"When to the lips
the soul's flood rises, brimming!"
What are you doing?
Your dad's reading poems to me.
Poems, sure.
Get in the tub with him,
why don't you?
Paolo, really now, don't be vulgar.
You're not going jealous on me,
are you?
It's pathetic.
That's it, go sulk.
I'll shut the door, so you'll be alone.
Let her rip!
It's good!
It's great!
It's clever.
Watch this. Paul...
Just wait.
Watch this one!
Okay man, ready?
Don't overdo it.
Watch this shot. Go on, pull it!
Go ahead, my boy!
Why if it isn't the pride of the family.
Slumming, are we?
I'm moving in for a few days.
I've left Macha temporarily.
Come here, Felice!
What's all this?
The step had rotted through.
Just camouflage it.
You said not to botch things.
Just make sure the balcony's ready.
How much is a new step?
$350.
For one step? Fuck!
Stop swearing, Felice.
I chose the best. Prime oak.
Why not MDF?
We're going to paint it.
I'm not fixing the whole porch.
If you look,
everything needs redoing.
I give her children, she kicks me out.
Come here, Felice!
The Karamazov’s finally reunited.
Sylvie, my son is completely undone.
- What do we do?
- We drink, Daddy!
We drink!
Hold that.
- Pass the blowtorch.
- Let me!
- No point using copper.
- Let me solder it!
Last time you torched the house.
Yeah, but I'm sober now.
It's not a game!
"I lay on the bed, paralyzed.
"My hands were moist,
"as were my neck,
my back, my thighs,
"my manhood.
"When she placed her shoe
on my crotch,
"I was overcome with
a terrible desire.
"I took her shoe and squeezed it
between my thighs."
There we go, I'm all wet.
"I took the neck of the shoe
"and caressed the canvas."
Who do you think you are,
Anais Nin?
It's awful.
Is that how you see me?
- She's not you!
- I initiated you into Tantric sex.
So?
You shouldn't write stoned.
It has moments, but no edge.
You have no imagination.
It's too close to us.
Transpose! Rule number one.
You can both kiss my ass.
I won't be lectured by
a university dropout
and a writer whose bibliography
is one book long.
But what a book!
Get the door, dammit!
I'm wounded!
Coming!
- A friend of yours.
- Not you!
I got no choice, Paul.
Garage Dino for a total of $3000.
- Dino?
- $3000!
That's without my cut.
It can't be. They have my car.
Your car...
Mom, mamma mia!
My 1990 Chave Hermitage!
Here we go!
Ninety-eight in <The Wine Spectator. >
<The Hachette> rated it three stars!
I brought you our new catalogue.
We have lots of
promising young authors. Interested?
I thought we could publish
my early poems.
Or a new version of "Masculine",
with a new ending.
I'm working on a postscript.
Has it come to that?
I need money desperately.
I'm willing to do radio.
You know,
it's been years since your novel,
but your public remembers.
They're waiting.
If you were seeing me
for the first time,
would I appeal to you?
I see you the way you were,
like I always see you in my dreams.
It doesn't matter.
Smoking's forbidden.
Put it out.
Please, it's my last cigarette.
<No way I'll spend>
<the weekend in here. >
<We brought you a book and chocolate. >
<You said you wanted>
<to kill yourself. I mean... >
<- I never said that. >
<- Sure! >
I was smoking,
I wasn't hurting anybody!
What kind of society is this?
We have the world's highest
suicide rate.
- Spare me your stupid numbers!
- Not so loud!
I want you to get me out.
When did you last get it up?
How dare you?
You could've told me.
Those problems are my specialty.
Me, impotent? What a laugh!
Don't be ashamed.
50% of men your age are affected.
It's even happened to me.
Stop laughing, you dolt.
Impotence often points
to graver problems.
You should stop smoking.
I got you in with the top specialist,
Dr. Frappier.
The day you can make a woman
purr with pleasure, we'll talk.
Until then, take care of Macha
and leave me alone.
Alcohol's great
for delaying ejaculation,
but after a certain age
it severely compromises performance.
Do you pee well?
Excuse me?
Is the flow strong
or a thin dribble from the urethra?
It flows pretty well.
Do you ever have to strain to urinate?
Sometimes, yes.
Sleep through the night?
What?
Do you often have to pee at night?
I sleep lightly,
and I drink a lot, so...
Do you wet your underwear?
After 50 your muscles begin to weaken,
the sphincters harden.
Do you sit to pee?
Do you ever feel pain
in your groin after orgasm?
Yes, sometimes, but...
I'm constantly tired. I feel heavy.
Your seminal canal
may be blocked.
I'll give you a suppository.
I can't ejaculate a second time.
And often not even the first.
- Twice in a row?
- When I'm able.
Wonderful!
And you hold back too, I bet!
Do like everyone else. Masturbate.
Discharge at your own rhythm.
This obsession
about postponing pleasure!
A prolonged erection without ejaculation
ruins the prostate.
Happiness lies in the present instant.
Shut up, you damn dogs!
Full-bodied for a burgundy, no?
The tannins are dry, it's taut.
I like it, it's very virile.
C'mon, Socrates. Time to paint.
You start, Narcissus.
I'll finish my wine.
I did most of it.
Fuck!
What are you doing?
You don't even have your license!
Are you sure it's here?
She must be inside.
You said there'd be
champagne and oysters.
We can't go in dressed like this.
Nothing's going to come between me
and Ms. Cliquot tonight.
Let me handle this. You just watch.
We nearly missed each other again.
A last-minute meeting in Taiwan,
you know how it is.
Suzanne, finally!
I get to put a ravishing face
on a name I already know so well.
I suspected your scintillating mind
would come in a pretty...
I didn't know our Asian office
was coming this year.
Our IT wizard.
- Here to brief us on a Malay virus.
- Ferocious.
On Tuesday.
Isn't Tuesday a holiday?
Why don't we go inside?
You can tell us
how the markets are performing.
Of course, Suzanne.
I'm thrilled to meet you.
Asians make extraordinary wives
And formidable businesswomen.
It's one and the same.
Sounds like they're perfect.
Perfection quickly grows stale.
Give me character any day...
some hysteria, some spice.
A woman is beautiful
when she's slightly wild.
I was looking for you.
Are there any oysters?
Martin!
What's he doing here?
Here's to a record year!
Unmatched profits!
Thanks to all of you here,
our firm can look to the future
with optimism and confidence.
He's losing it. We better go.
Sylvie, I'm warning you.
I know, you won't take me back.
I'd like to toast the women
gathered here tonight.
To the women,
because you're the strongest,
the loveliest,
the most ravishing creatures of all.
Your breasts, thighs...
We're off.
...your lips.
Without you, we are lost.
Uppers, downers...
It's all legal, it's all clean.
Try this with Ecstasy,
it's amazing!
What are these?
Antibiotics.
Cool, I have bronchitis.
One pill twice a day
at mealtime for 10 days.
Do you get queasy?
I have just the thing.
You like them on the wild side.
A little, yes.
It's my first Christmas home
in three years.
Wait till you taste my goose.
I can't.
I'll be with my family.
You're not serious?
We'll pack our bags
and head for Cuba.
We have to stop, Francois.
We can't go on like this.
Go on how?
Like right now.
We're hurting Paul.
I love you more than my children.
You're life, you're my life.
Everyone wants something from me
except you.
When you look at me
with your little smile,
I feel like I'm 20 again.
You love me only because
I pay attention.
I'm just a spectator, Francois.
One more woman.
But not just anyone.
The last one.
I wish I'd had a daughter like you.
With beautiful smiling eyes,
a lovely face and mind.
I love you, Sylvie.
My lovely child.
You stopped me
from doing something stupid.
That's what girls are for.
Why didn't you tell me, Dad?
Why don't you talk to me?
I'm always the last to know.
It's always like that.
Why didn't you tell me, Dad?
Why don't you talk to me?
You ought to know better.
Shit!
Aren't you at work?
You could've picked up the kids.
I worked all night.
I see you went shopping. Thanks.
Hasn't our reevaluation
gone on long enough?
I need more time.
Why can't I be here with the kids?
We have a deal, we stick to it.
You talk just like a lawyer.
It's actions that'll win me back.
I can't stay there after Christmas.
I have a big launch.
I can't function in that house.
If you come back,
the reason has to be right.
My number one reason is you.
I hope you know that.
I don't want you to ruin your manners
because those two are so undisciplined.
Yes, Daddy.
Hurry, don't let the cold in!
Stop scaring my kids, shit!
Is that any way to talk
in front of kids?
Hello!
Hello, sir.
Sir?
He's your grandpa.
Keep your boots on.
We're celebrating Christmas the old way.
Like in the 1800s, without electricity.
They cut you off?
I brought my kids!
It's -15, fuck!
Quit swearing.
That's no example for kids.
Some example, you!
You mustn't use bad words.
No, sir. It's not nice.
We've prepared
a wonderful surprise for you!
No peeking, kids!
Relax, Patrick.
We've plenty to burn, the water's running,
the food's in the tub.
Let's go to the Holiday Inn.
We want to stay here, Daddy.
We want to stay with Paul and sir.
Gramps!
Come on,
they want to celebrate with family.
It'll be an adventure.
The poor kids never get excited.
Please let us stay,
we'll be good.
Very good!
Alright,
it's decided, you stay.
But we have to follow a few rules.
No touching candles.
Don't call me sir, call me gramps.
Don't touch the dogs.
Tonight you drink,
it'll loosen you up.
Fuck!
- No other coat?
- Are you warm or not?
Daddy, the water's brown.
There's Evian on the table.
You look like Tartars, but me...
You look cool too, Daddy.
Get off that filthy mutt!
- Cool, really?
- Like a fairy princess!
There's more.
We still have to eat.
- Who's hungry?
- Me!
Good luck finding a place
open on the 25th.
We're not ordering in.
It's Christmas.
Everything's in the bathtub.
Paul and Cedric,
you get the bird.
Maude and I will do dessert.
Princess will pour us drinks!
The way one faces adversity
reveals one's courage.
In our case, there was but one way
to express it:
By drinking!
I should note that, it's good.
This reminds me of my trek
across Mongolia in '56.
On a motorcycle, with Catherine.
We'd eat with tribesmen
by their yurts...
We'd sleep under the stars.
We were starving, we froze,
but damn, we were in love!
It reminds me of camping
in the tundra with Sylvie.
Our escapades on skidoo,
our nights in the igloo...
- The igloo?
- Yeah.
It reminds me of the ice storm
in 1998.
With Macha in the school gym...
The lines to go pee,
the fights to get food...
It was crazy, but we were in love!
I love you, Daddy.
What is it?
Fuck!
The furniture, not the bottles!
A Chateau Lafite's
worth two sofas.
- Where's the valve?
- How should I know?
I found it!
Fuck!
What are you doing?
Daddy, the water's brown.
I know, sweetheart. Come here.
Careful of the leak.
Careful of the dog.
Paul, a ratchet,
vice grips, a wrench, a monkey...
What are you talking about?
Kids, if you find
a Latour or a Petrus,
it's very important
for Grandpa and Uncle, Okay?
Paul, a ratchet!
<Sailing, sailing, >
<over the bounding main! >
Dad, all the foreign editions
of your book...
There's the Italian version
of <Masculine Singular. >
Good doggie! Nice doggie!
That's a good doggie!
Sir, lie still please.
Don't move, Dad.
If you touch the cylinder
you get a 2000-volt shock.
It's cruel to invent such tales.
Maybe, but it works.
Stay still, they're starting.
Good news.
Your bladder and prostate
are perfectly healthy.
He won't go into hospital.
If you force him,
he won't last a month.
Are you willing
to look after him?
- You barely manage the dogs.
- We don't need you.
Radiation therapy, doctors' appointments,
pills every hour...
can you manage that?
Listen to yourself!
I'm not your son!
I don't care about you,
but I do about him.
Don't fuck around.
If you can't handle it,
we'll have him admitted.
I'll set timers for your medicine.
Wear them on your wrist.
No way I'm walking around
with a kitchen timer.
It's not Alzheimer's.
You'll remember, right?
Trazadone,
Empracet, Nyaderm,
Asaphen, Decadron,
Flovent, Morphinex...
If you skip one, you can collapse.
An overdose can cancel the effects
or exacerbate the side effects.
Stop fiddling and listen instead!
I don't want to be
a pharmaceutical lab rat.
What side effects?
See, I am listening.
Dizziness, nausea, diarrhea.
Pharmacology's a science,
but dosing is the trick.
What did I say?
Just because you're sick
doesn't mean you can hit me!
Sure, go pretend to write!
I have to concentrate
and prepare your pills.
Brilliant!
My smart son
needs to concentrate to count pills.
The mule will give them to me.
Times change.
A month ago you despised him!
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
What happened?
Patrick's getting to me.
He wants control.
You could've come.
You know I suck at that stuff.
Why'd you offer to look after him?
I had no choice.
Think I'm looking forward to it?
If it was up to him,
we'd bury him next week.
Don't exaggerate.
He says he won't see spring,
as if he wanted that.
Your dad's going to die, Paul.
Do you realize that?
We're all going to die.
Even you. Do you realize that?
I'm sorry.
I don't want us to fight.
Leave me alone.
I love you.
Don't cry, I can't comfort you.
I know that.
Please, stop it.
I love you.
I'm stoned, Christ!
How am I supposed to react?
I'm not a bastard.

It's the Beychevelle.
The other's the Cote-Rotie.
Really, after all these years
of tasting,
you confuse a vulgar Syrah
with a Cabernet!
I find the Syrah entirely noble.
Finished gargling?
Food's getting cold.
Yeah. Eat up, Dad.
You insisted we come here.
I'm not hungry.
Try, you'll aggravate our host.
Don't, he'll be sick.
I wanted to see it.
To smell it, above all.
It's like an old flame
you prefer not to see.
I like to keep my souvenirs intact.
- The bill, please.
- I want dessert.
You ate enough.
Dad and I are finished.
Have any cigars?
They're prohibited.
Who does he think he is?
What are you after?
Nothing. What do you mean?
Shit, you didn't hold back.
It won't kill you to pay it.
I'd like to go to New York
in the spring.
I want to buy some wine.
We'll go.
With the exchange rate?
Forget it!
One son makes empty promises,
the other sees only obstacles.
What'll happen when I'm gone?
You're constantly sniping,
contradicting each other.
We'd be there in nine hours.
You haven't understood.
It's not about getting anywhere.
What matters is leaving, looking.
It's not about the destination.
What matters is
what happens along the way.
That's what's amazing.
The detours,
the hitches along the way...
The encounters, too.
Especially the encounters.
Success, failure, illness,
they're just distractions, really.
Life puts things in our way.
What matters is
how we respond to them.
And what we leave behind.
Sometimes I wonder if...
I became impotent because
it was time to stop chasing women
and look after my sons.
But now...
illness, death...
What do I do about them?
What have I left you?
Want a little boost?
No.
You okay, Paul?
Yeah, I'm coming.
Don't forget my water.
What's wrong?
I'm almost done.
Hurry, Christ!
Stop your yapping, I'm coming!
My water, you imbecile!
What were you doing all that time?
I'm okay.
It's not working, Paul.
We can't keep Dad here.
You don't respect the doses...
- You forget his medication half the time.
- That's not true.
It's not a reproach.
I'm strung out too. I've had it.
We have to get him into hospital.
It has to come from you.
If it's from me, he'll refuse.
I'll try.
But I'm not guaranteeing anything.
Want a wheelchair?
I can walk, shit!
Why not an urn, maybe?
Would you like a coffin, Miss?
You look tired.
A tranquilizer, Miss?
My son sells them.
Take him to Admissions,
I'll make up his room.
Nice going, you alienated
the entire nursing staff in 10 minutes.
You'll get no Jell-O for a week now.
Think we don't know your game?
This isn't private school.
You can't get expelled.
Dad!
You're in pediatrics?
Those babies sure are lucky!
You're a veritable balm
for the eyes,
a feast, a banquet.
Beauty such as yours deserves
to be admired, celebrated even.
It should grace the terminal care unit
where my sons are parking me.
A man, if he is one,
wants to go out with fireworks
full of beauty and sensuality,
in an orgasmic clash of sound.
He wants to leave with howls
and pungent odors.
A man, if he is one,
prefers to end as he began,
instead of fading away
in silence and indifference.
One must live before one dies.
If you don't grasp that,
my dear sons,
I'll have failed in my role as father.
Paul!
Come here, shit!
I'm working.
I said, come here!
I'm busy.
Liar!
You are not, you're pretending.
Think I don't know?
What do you do,
locked up in your office all day?
You're supposed to look after me.
Answer me, Paolo!
Stop calling me Paolo!
My name's Paul, fuck!
You're wasting your best years.
What'll you do when I'm gone?
You never were here.
You're lucky your sons talk to you.
I may have been irresponsible,
but at your age I worked.
One year, and then
you lived off one novel all your life.
Bravo!
I may have written only one novel,
but at least I wrote it.
Some novel! You invented nothing.
It's a biography.
Maybe if you had a life,
you'd have something to say.
You'd rather I pushed pills?
I'm worth more than that.
You don't remember
what you're worth,
not since taking my pills.
Patrick?
It's the details, noticing the little things
most men overlook.
Lower the heat
or you'll lose all the aroma.
Like this?
A neck, a shoulder,
a beauty spot placed like
an exclamation mark.
Women entrance me.
Especially the ones we don't notice,
those we neglect...
You can put the meat on.
All my life I tried
to capture their essence.
A luscious curve of the hips.
A well-turned ankle.
A movement bathed in grace.
I've left the finest pages of my work
between the sheets.
Why are you praying?
I'm depressed.
I feel like killing myself.
Don't start that again, please.
I want you to get me out of here.
Are you taking your antidepressants?
I stop, start up again.
You know I disapprove of them.
You can't just suddenly stop.
That's why you're depressed.
They're why I can't get hard.
You'll find my will
in the glove compartment.
What are you doing here?
I'm here because I love you.
Hold on.
- Lean out.
- Thanks.
Slowly.
That's it.
You okay?
Can I have a kiss, <bella? >
Don't look so gloomy.
I'm very fast on four wheels.
This'll keep you warm.
Here we go.
Okay great, that's it!
I'll show you!
- Is he alright?
- I'm thirsty.
Hurry up, Dad. I'll be late.
Leave me alone, I'm busy.
Are you okay?
Open the door please.
Go away!
He's alright.
It smells of shit.
Open up, Dad.
You don't have your cane.
Open or I'll break it down.
I don't understand what happened.
It's alright, Dad.
It was an accident.
Come sit.
I don't understand. It...
Get some towels and a garbage bag.
Don't cry, Dad. It can happen.
We'll undress him, give him a bath.
Let me have your shirt.
Give me your shirt.
I'll wash it with the rest.
He's a good boy, you know.
He's more fragile, that's all.
You're strong.
I'm not worried about you.
I'm losing everything.
For a long time
I thought you'd be the writer.
Promise me one thing.
Look after Paul.
Unconditionally, okay?
Did Patrick leave?
What's up?
I was working.
Bring us a good bottle
from the cellar.
We haven't had
a tasting in a while.
Just one glass.
A good bottle, you choose.
It's good!
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking about my book.
Find your ending?
I think so.
Promise me one thing.
Look after Patrick.
"Writing is re-writing.
"Projecting yourself into the future,
unencumbered and a temporal.
"And above all, persisting.
"If I'd had your perseverance,
I'd have written more than one book.
"But with me
distractions always held the upper hand.
"I hope you're leading
the life you want.
"There's nothing admirable
about adversity that you cannot end.
"Your father who loves you."
It's not good. He's in a coma.
- Can we see him?
- Not just yet.
Is it the brain tumor?
We don't know. He's dying.
There's almost no brain activity.
If he survives, he'll be a mess.
Probably paralyzed and unconscious.
Can you overdose from Viagra?
For three months I've given him
one a day, to make him happy.
- I feel responsible. Can it kill you?
- No.
Look, Paul...
I don't think you understand.
Papa's practically gone.
- His brain's nearly dead.
- Nearly!
That means that if,
by miracle, he lives,
he'll be a vegetable.
Dad wouldn't want to live like that.
We have to respect his wishes.
I was supposed
to take care of him!
I wasn't there for him!
I should have done more!
How do you think I feel?
I wasn't there either.
It can't end like this. Come on...
We'll go to New York.
His heart's too fragile.
The slightest upset will kill him.
Was the character of Mishka
inspired by you?
I never screwed his dad.
You've capitalized
on your dad's success.
Well, I think...
What can a father bequeath
other than an attitude?
A house? Money?
Anyone can have those.
A father's words first enable us
to interpret the world.
Paul could have written his book
without his father's.
But he couldn't write it
if his dad hadn't been
part of his life.
Who are you?
The subject of my next novel.
And what a novel!
To life!
Quite a subject.
