I believe he has. Along with
thousands of other people.
Are you aware of the two men having met
outside of the interview room?
- I mean here, for example?
- No, I´m not.
You say, I think there might
have been some irregularity...
concerning your client and Mr Lukic.
The Custody Sergeant has a
list of approved interpreters.
- Mr Lukic is listed.
- Yes, yes, of course he is.
But it is a Custody Sergeant´s
decisión which interpreter to use.
Not the suspect´s lawyers.
I brought him along to save time.
I just need to know if it was your
decisión to include Mr Lukic...
or if he asked or persuaded
you to bring him in.
No, it was my decisión.
Zigic had just over two hours
to work his way across London
and locate Jasmina in a hospital
that houses over 4,000 people.
I think he had help.
I think he was told where to find her.
Cheadle, could you
get that file on Lukic?
Jasmina was executed,
she was shot with a single
bullet to the back of the head.
We know that Duscan Zigic did it.
With Samira, it was very different.
It was... It was up close.
It was personal. She was... She
was tortured with cigarette butts.
She was strangled with a pair of hands.
Milan Lukic.
The interpreter. The optician.
I think Zigic and Lukic
were members of the
same paramilitary unit.
I think those two sisters .
were killed to cover up a massacre..
they were both involved in.
I think Lukic was the devil that
Samira saw on her way to work.
He recognised her. He
had Zigic kidnap her.
He tortured her to find
out where Jasmina was,
so he could silence her, as well.
But Samira wouldn´t talk. So he
murdered her, he dumped her body,
to get maximum publicity,
so he could flush out
information about Jasmina.
- So he could find a way...
- Sorry I´m late. Sorry, guv.
This is a supposition based
on the story of a dead witness.
I have no proof that there´s any
connection between the two men.
All I´ve got is this file on Lukic.
That´s the side he wants us to
see. It´s the side he had vetted.
Let´s find out the other
side. The nasty secrets.
His work, marriage, debts. Let´s
pay Mr and Mrs Lukic a visit
and see what we can find out about them.
Mr Lukic?
Could we have a word, sir?
- About what?
- If we could talk inside, sir.
- Yes?
- Mrs Lukic?
- Yes.
- I´m DS Jane Tennison.
And this is DC Lorna
Greaves. Is your husband home?
- Er... No, he´s at work.
- Oh.
It´s just that he´s
helping us with a case.
I wanted to ask him a few questions.
Is it all right if we
come in and wait for him?
- Yes, sure.
- Lovely. Thank you.
I was just admiring
your two beautiful girls.
I can see your husband in them.
I don´t think so. They´re not his.
Really? I can usually spot a likeness.
So these are your parents or his?
These are all photos of my family.
Have you been to Serbia to visit his?
- No. Why don´t I call him?
- No, you know, don´t bother him.
This is just a formality.
We´re asking everyone
who came in contact
with a particular suspect
where they were at certain times.
You mean, like an alibi?
I don´t understand.
My husband was working for
you. Now he´s a suspect?
No... It´s just... really
just standard procedure.
Erm... Lorna,
what´s the day that we were talking?
God, my brain´s a sieve these days.
- Saturday, 20th, three weeks ago.
- Yes, that´s right.
- Yes, Saturday three weeks ago.
- He works on a Saturday.
And that Saturday evening?
Three weeks ago...
- We went to the theatre.
- Really? What did you see?
I´m going to call him.
Outside of the interview room,
have you ever met or
talked with Duscan Zigic?
No.
Have you ever seen him at the
Community Centre in Bishop´s Avenue?
No.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Soon.
Very soon.
It seems my wife is also
being questioned by the police.
Super, I think.
My wife seems somewhat
upset by the experience.
So if you´ll excuse me.
And when he came home,
were you awake or asleep?
Asleep.
I really can´t remember the details
of something trivial
happening three weeks ago.
Well, do you remember what
he was wearing that night?
A blue suit, I think.
Do you know what happened
to that blue suit?
No idea at all.
So you can´t show it to me?
I´d rather wait until my husband
comes home, if that´s all right.
Excuse me.
I´ve been subjected to the
most ridiculous questions.
Superintendent Tennison.
Mr Lukic.
This is DC Lorna Greaves.
Hello.
I´ve just been talking
to some of your officers.
I´m sure you know that.
Please sit.
So, this is all because I helped
out as an interpreter, yes?
To eliminate you from our inquiries, yes.
So, your wife says that
Saturday evening three weeks ago
you were at the theatre, then
you drove the baby-sitter home.
What did you do after that?
- I came home. I went to bed.
- Was your wife awake?
Yes, we talked about the play.
Your wife said she was asleep.
We sat up and talked.
Now you´ve said it, I remember. Sorry.
- And what were you wearing?
- That I can´t remember.
That Saturday morning,
what were you doing?
- At work. Why?
- What time did you get to work?
First appointment would be about eight.
Then I worked through till lunch time.
And how do you know Rosemary Henderson,
Zigic´s solicitor?
I´ve already been over this.
I did some translation work for her.
She seemed to think it went well...
so she contacted me for this job.
See.
All right, well. Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs Lukic. I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Oh, did you serve in
the Army during the war?
You know I did.
It´s in my police file.
Oh, gosh!
Oh, I´m sorry, I´m sorry.
Hello, Dad.
Hello.
- Right.
- Er...
That´s erm...
That´s Wendy´s chair.
No-one messes with Wendy. Sorry, love.
Oh, OK.
- Erm... Is this one all right?
- Yes.
I... I hope you´ll stay long
enough to take your coat off.
How was supper?
Oh...
A lot better than my efforts used to be.
Thanks to my two very generous daughters,
I have the best room in the house.
Really, it´s...
...good here.
Pam tells me they´ve
offered you retirement.
Well, it´s just one option.
Take it.
Grab it with both
hands. Run for the hills.
Well, look at you.
You can start a whole new life.
You´ve done your bit over and over.
Time you got out of the sewers.
That´s how you´ve always seen it.
Oh, sorry.
Look at the thanks you get.
The newspapers. That girl´s murder.
It´s as if you´d pulled the trigger.
I tell you, once you´ve stopped,
you´ll look around.
You´ll only ask why
you didn´t do it sooner.
Seen a ghost?
It´s going cold. You can sense
other priorities taking over.
Perhaps he has legged it home.
Sorry. Erm...
Lukic´s details, guv. He checks out.
I went back to student days.
A year in Bosnia, then
he trained in Manchester.
The university and the eye
hospital confirmed he graduated.
They didn´t give us a
lot. Records are patchy.
I did found out he set up a
shop with his wife´s money.
Oh, good.
Yes!
The Hardy case. They all
went down. 18 years apiece!
Good. Well done, Simon. Congratulations.
Guv, we might have something.
Lukic´s appointments for that
Saturday, some are fictional.
His 8 o´clock and 8:30 were real, but...
from nine till one, although
the names are genuine clients,
when I checked,
they didn´t have
appointments that morning.
Not only could he have
crossed paths with Samira,
- he´s covering it up.
- Yes, guv.
Simon, Simon. If you´ve got a moment,
perhaps some of your good fortune
will rub off on this investigation.
- Well done, Simon.
- Sorry, Taff, no time.
Itchy and Scratchy Show.
I´m sorry to keep you waiting.
He does know you´re here.
Lynda, would you get me a double
espresso and one of those cakes?
I´ll pay you back.
If you´ve come for your
glasses, they´re not in yet.
No, that´s not why we´re here.
We´re here to ask you again
where you were on the morning
of Saturday 20th of last month.
Well, as I told you, I was with clients.
But I wasn´t here all the time.
- Where were you?
- The Boston Hotel.
- Hyde Park?
- Yes.
I met a client there at 9:30,
and stayed until about 12.
Why did you meet the client at the hotel?
For sex.
lt´s never the lie
that damns you, is it?
It´s always the cover-up.
Mickey, we´ve had a tip-off.
Zigic. It´s a phone-in,
but this one sounds real.
Aubrey Hotel. Kings Cross.
Hotel manager just
confirmed the description.
Lovely.
I love my wife.
And I was trying to protect my marriage.
I filled in false appointments
in the hope you´d see...
I had a full morning.
I´m not at all practised or very
bright at this kind of thing.
I panicked.
Er... Excuse me, boss.
Could we have the
client´s details, please?
Of course.
Perhaps it was working as an interpreter.
A voyeur into your criminal worid.
I thought I could get away with it.
I´d make a hopeless villain.
The name and address of the
client you were with, please.
Will you tell my wife?
If it has nothing to do
with our investigation,
we won´t interfere in a private
matter between you and your wife.
The name, please.
Yes, of course.
Sarah Ford.
He´s in number nine.
- Another half-mile silence zone.
- Understood.
Off!
Oh, come on. Come on, come on!
Got it? Good.
- I´ve been expecting you.
- Yeah.
The suspect´s in a room facing the street.
My lads are being briefed now.
- Have you got the authority?
- Yes.
- Anything else I need to know?
- He´s ex-Bosnian paramilitary.
He won´t give himself up.
It´s about national pride.
He´ll either shoot his way out
or he´ll commit suicide.
Inspector to all patrols.
Implement roadblocks now.
I have clear sight of the suspect.
Repeat: I have clear sight.
I have lost sight of suspect.
The question is whether
he´s still in the room.
Oh, God, not again.
- Get back!
- Get back.
Fucking hell! What´s going on?
Oh, my God! Get up, get up!
I´m not leaving anything!
Contact now!
Freeze!
Urgh!
Get back in!
- Hello, Larry.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
- Haven´t seen you in ages.
Would you like a cup of tea, sir?
- Milk, no sugar.
- Front row, sir?
Do you understand?
Do you need the interpreter?
- How´s it going?
- I think he´s trying to work out,
"Is it going to help me if I go Muppet?"
You weren´t in your room that
Friday evening. Where did you go?
- Hospital.
- Why did you go to the hospital?
I was sick.
Very sick.
Did you see a doctor?
Don´t remember.
You know all about
security cameras, don´t you?
That´s your job.
So, you were seen on a security camera,
carrying a gun.
The same gun that we
found on you at the hotel.
That gun was used to kill a young woman.
We have evidence that suggests
that you killed that woman.
I´m sorry. We won´t talk about that now.
And that´s painful for you.
I know.
I know it´s painful. You don´t
kill women and children, do you?
That´s not why you
fought for your country.
No.
Ten years ago, you were ordered
to kill two young sisters,
weren´t you?
But you disobeyed that order.
You let them go.
So we won´t talk about what
happened at the hospital.
But what we do need to talk about
is how you knew where to find her.
Did someone tell you?
Who told you?
I killed her.
<i>I killed her</i>
Yes!
- Who told you where to find her?
- Ssh!
<i>I killed her</i>
Yes, but not the first woman.
I mean, that girl was tortured.
Tortured. You don´t torture.
What´s she doing?
You wouldn´t burn a girl with
cigarettes. That´s not you.
Who did that?
I killed them both.
Both sisters.
I killed them both.
Why did you kill them?
Well done, guys. Drinks are on me.
I don´t believe you
did this on your own.
This is my word. I say no more.
- To the double! Cheers!
- Cheers.
Where´s Jane?
- Bloody typical. Late as usual.
- She´s on her way.
Saw you on the evening news,
sir. Very impressive. Looked good.
Should make the ten o´clock, too.
"Police catch evil monster." Should
shut the bastards up for a while.
She´s convinced another man´s involved.
Can you imagine, for the rest of his life,
every time he flushes a toilet, the anxiety?
He´s going to shit himself again, in´t he?
- I´ve seen him.
- Who?
Zigic. The man on the póster,
on the TV. I´ve seen him.
- Where´s that, sir?
- Aubrey Hotel, Kings Cross
Kings Cross? And wher was that?
Now. I see him now. He just went in.
OK. Can I just take
your name and number?
Sir?
Tennison.
Ah, there you are, ma´am.
There´s a Mr Lukic in reception for you.
- He says he has something for you.
- Thank you.
I was passing by.
- Please.
- Oh.
- Mm. Good.
- May I?
Excellent.
If you have any problems,
please don´t hesitate to call me.
Well, goodbye.
Oh!
I saw the news about our friend,
Mr Zigic.
Congratulations.
Oh, God. The last time
I saw Martin was...
- ...your wedding.
- At the wedding.
He complains it´s the
last time he saw anybody.
You did the right thing to
concentrate on your career.
Simon says you did the hard
slog and spotted the white van.
Well done.
That´s where the answers
always are. In the details.
We need more good people like
you coming through. Good work.
Here she is!
- Well done, ma´am.
- No, good result all round.
- Good work. Thanks.
- Cheers.
Not over yet. Yeah? Yes, sir?
- Glad it came good for you. Well done.
- Well...
I´ve charged him with the second murder.
I still want to question
him about the first.
Sorry, I´ve got to get this. Excuse me.
You were right.
And I was...
so wrong.
You know, I listened to
that tip-off phone call.
Yeah. Male. Foreign accent.
That was made
from an untraceable mobile phone.
It could have been genuine, but...
if it wasn´t, that was
meant to be a death sentence.
Someone knew we´d send
an armed response unit.
They knew that Zigic would try and fight
his way out or else he´d take his own life.
It wasn´t Lukic. The call was
made at 15:17. He was with us.
- Oh, was he?
- Yeah.
Yeah, he was. We got to the shop
at 15:15, maybe even a bit before.
Don´t you remember, he kept us waiting?
Like three, four minutes?
That´s long enough to
make a mobile phone call.
You really want it to be him, don´t you?
- No, ignore her.
- No, no.
All right. Don´t
celebrate too soon, guys.
Not done and dusted, OK?
Hold your horses.
Should I call a lawyer?
There´s a swarm of them
just beyond that glass.
Mr Lukic didn´t warn you we´d be
asking you to support his alibi?
No, he didn´t.
That doesn´t necessarily surprise me.
Oh?
I can support his alibi.
I was with him at the Boston
Hotel that particular Saturday.
We met about 9:30 and
left sometime before 12.
Can you be a little more... precise?
About what?
Er... The time.
Not really, no.
Who paid for the room?
It was my turn.
The credit card transaction says 11:43.
Give us two minutes to say, "Bye. We
really must do this again sometime."
Puts us back out on the street at 11:45.
He went north. I went west.
Sergeant, would you mind waiting
outside for a few moments?
Yes, ma´am.
Woman to woman.
I thought you might not
be quite so frightened.
What´s he done?
We´re investigating the brutal,
sadistic murder of a young woman...
...that took place
that Saturday evening.
And you suspect Milan?
How long have you known him?
Two or three months. We´ve
met five or six times.
Where did you first meet?
He´s my optician.
But you´re in a relationship.
How did that start?
I... went to have my eyes checked.
What I thought was going to be a
dull chore turned out to be fun.
He´s very seductive.
Charming. Extremely straightforward.
He knew what he wanted
and he knew how to ask.
It was refreshing.
Did he talk about his marriage?
Yes.
He cheats on his wife.
I doubt he gave me a second thought
outside the times we were together.
But brutal and sadistic?
No, I´m sorry.
Absolutely not.
It´s just not him at all.
And I would know.
So, 11:45...
to 12.
It still gives us a 15-minute window
in which he could have seen Samira.
She could have seen him.
- Do you want my honest opinion?
- No.
You can see the hotel from here.
Sarah Ford said he was walking
north in this direction.
Samira would have been on her way
to work in the opposite direction.
She´s going to go in right there. It
would have been about 11:50, 11:55.
Let´s say that he saw
her around about here.
Can you imagine that shock?
He was... He was certain she was dead.
And now she´s come back to haunt him.
She could ruin his new life.
But he hasn´t seen her for ten years.
She was a kid. 12 years old.
Maybe she looks very like...
like her sister did when she was 22.
Samira would recognise the man who
raped and tortured her for four days.
So, she catches sight of him.
He walks on.
But he... he´s not
certain that she saw him.
He´s not even sure that it was her.
He´s got to make himself sure,
otherwise it´ll gnaw away at him.
So... So he can´t resist. He looks
back and sees her going into the hotel.
Now, we were getting close to him.
We made him admit that he was
here that Saturday morning.
So he gives us Zigic.
He knew that Zigic was a loyal soldier.
He´d lay down to two murders. Maybe
we´d kill him into the bargain.
But there´s no link
between Zigic and Lukic.
Zigic and Lukic.
I´ve found your massacre.
Are you serious?
An Italian cameraman I used to hang out
with heard I was digging around.
It´s the exact date...
...and the details match.
He tried to sell the footage
here, but it was er...
far too harrowing to be shown
in British homes after dinner.
What button is it?
- Er... The triangle.
- Yeah. Got it.
Oh, my...
And where does this take us?
It shows that the massacre took place.
I think those two sisters
were murdered to cover it up.
I think it´s essential that I go to
Bosnia and I visit the site of the massacre
to establish a link with Milan Lukic.
Oh, you think so?
Well, I´ve... studied his file.
And he´s been very carefully vetted.
All the more reason to go to Bosnia.
I think he´s the mind
behind both murders.
That´s supposition without any evidence.
Yeah, that´s because the
evidence is in Bosnia!
How many current murder
investigations are you managing?
24?
Jane, I can´t sanction this
in terms of time, money or
just sheer effective policing.
You´ve got a suspect who´s
confessed to both murders.
Close it. Move on.
No way are you going to Bosnia!
This is it.
You wait here.
Police.
They don´t much like foreigners
sticking their fingers in old wounds.
Did they... talk about the massacre?
Massacre?
What massacre?
<i>Dali znate ovog covjeka?</i>
<i>Ne.</i>
Ask her if she was here
in the summer of ´92.
<i>Jeste li zivjeli ovdje
u ljeto devedest droge?</i>
<i>Ne.</i>
<i>Dali znate za masakr sto se ovde deiso?</i>
<i>Ne znam o cemu govorite.</i>
<i>- Dovidjenja.
- Dovidjenja.</i>
She´s lived here all her
life. There was no massacre,
no paramilitary and she´s never seen him.
Erm... Excuse me.
<i>Ne.</i>
<i>Picku materinu govna odvratina,
sta traze ovdje!</i>
- What are they saying?
- Nothing helpful.
You´re not the force for good
you imagine yourself to be.
A lot of people think they lost the war
through meddling foreigners.
Are there any Muslims we can ask?
I´m sorry I asked you to come back here.
I didn´t do any good here before
and now I feel even more useless.
We´re never going to find out anything.
OK, let´s move on to
where we know he studied.
- How far is it to Kraz...
- Krazinac.
- Krazinac.
- Four or five hours.
Oh!
Maybe a little longer.
You told me I would never
understand how he thinks.
I wouldn´t be able to
get inside of his head.
I thought going to
the factory would help.
All it did was terrify you.
- Sickened me.
- There´s hope for you yet.
I spent four years taking
pictures of it and I miss it.
Tennison and West.
Room 7.
- There´s another room.
- Just a second.
Room 15.
You´re on the seventh and
you´re on the eighth floor.
You´re welcome.
My floor.
It´s supposed to be an enduring legacy
of all communist regimes.
Oh, Jesus!
Excellent filing...
on everyone and everything.
It didn´t work for this population.
Sorry.
- Milan Lukic, yes?
- Yes.
Milan Lukic... completed
an ophthalmic course here,
then moved to England, Manchester.
Could I see?
- Nothing else?
- No.
Could you locate someone who
worked and studied with him
but still lives in the area?
I´d be very appreciative.
You sit down here.
"Why don´t you sit here?"
"Anything for you, Robert."
Milan Lukic?
Of course. He´s alive?
Yes, yes. He´s living in London.
We were students together.
He went to study in England. Came
back when the war broke out...
to look after his father.
Then the idiot got himself drafted.
When was the last time you saw him?
Mm... Early on in the war.
We lost contact.
I heard rumours he was dead.
A very shy... and gentle man.
Always writing terrible poetry.
Shy?
This man?
That´s not Milan.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- Well, do you know who this is?
- Dragan Jankovic.
- Dragan...
- Jankovic.
Jankovic.
Erm... Well, how do you know him?
He studied with us.
But he never completed.
I think there was some kind of...
family expectation that he would
go into an uncle´s practice.
But he went into local government
or somewhere he could scam money.
- Was he in the Army?
- Not the regular one. Too many rules.
In the beginning, we were
quite distant from the war here.
Jankovic was one of the first,
later to be known as,
´´weekend warriors´´.
They had contact with
the paramilitary groups.
They´d keep their regular jobs
but go off and play
soldiers at the weekend.
Jankovic wasn´t interested in politics.
He wasn´t a nationalist.
It was just a sport to him.
Hunting Muslims.
Then I heard he disappeared.
We assumed he´d been killed.
What happened?
He became an optician.
In North London.
Simon. Simon, it´s me.
Listen, put a surveillance on Milan Lukic.
We´ve had a major breakthrough.
He isn´t who he says he is.
I´ll meet you tomorrow morning.
I want a squad meeting
at eight sharp, OK?
Good. Bye.
Where does he think you´ve phoned from?
Paris. Where you´ll take
me when this is all over.
Jane.
We´re needed over at Scotland
Yard for a meeting now.
A meeting? Why? What´s
the meeting about, sir?
I´d be lying if I said I didn´t know.
Bosnia.
What the hell were you playing at?
Come in, Jane.
- Take a seat.
- Sir.
Scratch your mark on those.
Official secrets.
It´s never been a
problem for you before.
And then are we going to be introduced?
Oh, I´m not important.
I just brought the forms over.
Obrad Stankovic.
Milutin Ksumovic.
Rade Vemic.
They have over 100 indictments
for crimes against humanity.
The UN have been after them for years.
After a great deal of effort,
time and money, they´ve got them.
But they wouldn´t have got them without
information supplied by Milan Lukic.
Lukic has infiltrated a
section of the Serbian community
that has intelligence on the
whereabouts of suspected war criminals.
He´s in position to be
extremely useful in the future.
Milan Lukic´s real
name is Dragan Jankovic.
He is also a war criminal.
He´s responsible for the rape of
women and children as young as 12...
...and for the massacre of some
30 civilian Muslim men and boys.
You are correct about
his name and cover.
We helped set it up for him,
as well as securing him a position
as an approved police interpreter.
We know the rumours.
The ´´weekend warrior´´, the
massacre that you refer to.
None of them are true.
Probably difficult for you to
appreciate the number of old scores
that are settled by accusation in Bosnia.
We are aware of the
unsubstantiated allegations
made by one of the murdered sisters
that she was a witness to the massacre.
But she identified Zigic, not Jankovic.
And if Dragan Jankovic is responsible
for the murder of those two sisters?
- He isn´t.
- I can produce evidence to prove that he is.
We don´t think you can.
Yes, well...
with respect, what you
think is not the issue here.
I am the Senior Investigating Officer
and it is a matter between me
and the Crown Prosecution Service.
Yes, it is. No question about that.
You became suspicious of Jankovic because
of his role as a police interpreter.
You correctly deduced he was
infiltrating the interview room.
There is, however, no other connection
and no history between him and Zigic.
There are no records that will connect them.
And no contemporary evidence, either.
We have come to the conclusión
that Zigic was acting alone
and that the alibi provided
by Mrs Jankovic for her husband
proves conclusively that he
is innocent of any involvement.
I do appreciate
the desire to associate oneself with an
historical tragedy is a very potent one.
It gives a sense of self-worth
and importance.
I advise you to resist that urge.
You may not use anything
that has been said here
or deduce anything from what you have
learnt to further your investigation.

To do so would put you in breach
of the Official Secrets Act.
You may not tell anyone of what
has happened here. Is that clear?
- Detective Superintendent Tennison?
- Yes.
Yes, that´s clear.
- I had everyone here for eight.
- Get Zigic produced.
We´re charging him with both murders.
Guv, I had a thought. The
real Lukic lived in Manchester.
In four years, he must
have seen a dentist.
I´ve been checking dental records.
No luck yet, but I´ve still
got people getting back to me.
So...
- Are we going after him?
- No.
No. Not on the evidence we´ve got.
We´ll never secure a conviction.
Can we ask him who he thinks he is?
With all the other investigations
we´ve got, requiring time and money, no.
We will secure a conviction
against Zigic. Get him produced.
She´s been overruled?
Come on. Cheer up. It´s a
success. Time to move on.
- Plenty of other cases.
- Tick, tick, tick, tick...
Tick, tick, tick, tick...
Oh, come on!
I don´t know what to do.
Oh...
It´s a long time since I´ve heard that.
From what you´ve told
me, you´ve done your bit.
It´s up to others now.
Oh...
That factory you went to...
where the two sisters
hid amongst the dead.
You know I drove an
ambulance in the War...
- You did know that, didn´t you?
- Yeah.
Well, we got an order to
go to a place called Belsen.
The name didn´t mean anything.
We didn´t know what a
concentration camp was.
We never knew they existed.
We got there...
the day it was liberated.
April 15th, 1945.
Just before we pitched up,
someone had seen a movement in this...
...mountain of skeletons.
They pulled a little girl out.
She lived for a couple of hours.
So, we were given the orders to...
search through all the mountains,
in case there were others.
Later on, they put a figure on it.
10,000 unburied corpses.
Well, we were ambulance men.
We were used to death, but...
I say skeletons...
...but they weren´t just bones.
They were men,
women,
children...
They were being... starved,
gassed...
And because the incinerators
hadn´t been working...
...they were piled up like rubbish.
We didn´t find anything.
We didn´t find anyone.
I think that little girl
must have crawled in,
looking for somewhere to hide or...
...somewhere quiet, so
she could die in peace.
You know...
up until about the age of 12...
...you were an ángel.
You´d light up a room.
And then bang! Overnight,
you were a teenager.
You ran us ragged.
And it got worse.
Anti-this, anti-that. So
certain, so bloody-minded.
You couldn´t leave anything
alone. You terrified me!
But you know what?
God knows, I did admire you.
I was so proud.
You had convictions.
Well, I buried mine at that camp.
When I came home, all I wanted
was your mother, a steady job...
...children and nothing to do...
...with the evil I saw at that camp.
But...
...here you are, having
to deal with it again.
But you will.
You will.
You know what´s right...
and you´ll do it.
Thanks, Dad.
I know what I´m doing. I just
don´t know why I´m doing it.
Good morning, sir. I´m DS Alun Simms.
I´d like you to come with
me to a police station
to answer some questions.
Questions about what?
It will be explained to you, sir.
You know something? I don´t want to go.
Dragan Jankovic,
I´m arresting you on suspición
of the murder of Samira Blekic.
This is absolute nonsense.
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...
This, madam, is a warrant, which
entitles us to search these premises.
What about my daughters?
I have two small children.
I have to pick them up from school.
Social Services can take care of them...
or you can arrange for a friend
or relative to look after them.
I´m sorry. Totally out
of the question. Totally.
Susan. Elizabeth Lukic,
I´m arresting you...
on suspición of perverting
the course of justice.
Superintendent, how are you?
<i>- For thne bennefit of the video
- What´s going on?</i>
She changed her mind.
Do you think that Hall knows about this?
Good question.
Press that button and ask her.
Good morning, Mr Jankovic.
I must insist that you call
my client by his correct name.
Lukic.
- Jankovic is not his name.
- Well, I believe it is.
For the record, I´m showing
the suspect a document.
It´s the names of the students
who studied ophthalmology...
in the University of Krazinac in 1987.
The names I´d like him particularly to
note are Dragan Jankovic and Milan Lukic.
I have a written
statement from a witness
who will confirm the suspect´s
identity as Dragan Jankovic,
not Milan Lukic.
He goes under an assumed identity.
For the record,
the witness´s statement is incorrect.
My name is Milan Lukic.
As I have told you,
I have been vetted by the Metropolitan
Police for work as an interpreter.
Yes. Perhaps they didn´t
do a very good job.
You´ll have to take that up with them.
I believe some fairly senior
officers were involved.
For the video, I am showing Mr Jankovic
a photographic record
of the bodies of 26 men.
I believe he gave the order
for these men to be executed.
My client has not been arrested in
connection with these alleged crimes.
These questions are irrelevant.
They are relevants because I believe
the murders under investigation...
were carried out to
cover up this massacre.
Ridiculous!
We have a witness who says that you
were the leader of a paramilitary unit.
I went home to look after my father.
I was drafted into the Army.
I was not in the paramilitary.
Well, why don´t you
tell me about your war?
Did you kill?
Yes.
Once? Twice?
More?
Many times.
And did you kill women and children?
We all did.
Civilians get caught up in wars.
I believe we were all
responsible for many deaths,
in one way or another.
Did you...
ever strangle anyone?
Superintendent, I really must insist...
Yes.
And was that a man or a woman?
A young man.
A night-time operation.
I spent the rest of the night
lying next to him in the trench.
It was a very cold, long night.
The reality of war.
Did you ever write
about your experiences?
You´ve done your research.
My poetry.
Guilty as charged.
Oh... So sorry to keep you waiting.
I need to get home to my children.
Oh, yes, yes. Of course you do.
I do understand.
We´ve discovered that your husband
is living under an assumed identity.
His real name is Dragan Jankovic.
I understand, it´s a shock.
You won´t want to believe it.
We will be able to verify
his identity in court.
You have been the victim
of a very cruel fraud.
Your husband is not who he says he is.
I know exactly who my husband is.
I don´t think you do.
He´s a brutal, sadistic man, who
committed atrocities in Bosnia,
including the rape of a 12-year-old girl,
who he subsequently
murdered four weeks ago.
I think it´s best to
let you absorb this.
I´ll... I´ll leave you for a while.
No, I need to get home to my children.
Look and learn, children.
- Look and learn.
- I have to get back to my children.
Saturday 20th, you were at the
Boston Hotel with Sarah Ford.
Yes.
You arrived at 9:30 and
we know you left at 11:45.
Where did you go after that?
Back to work.
And what route did you take?
I walked to the underground station.
Passing the back entrance
of the Radcliffe Court Hotel?
That is the hotel where Samira Blekic worked.
She would have been walking towards you
on her way to work between 11:45 and noon.
I do wish you´d wear
the glasses I prescribed.
Eye strain can lead to headaches.
Create all sorts of serious problems.
You failed to complete your
ophthalmic training, Mr Jankovic.
You are not a qualified optician.
Not true.
And I didn´t hear any
complaints from you.
You set up your business with
your wife´s money, didn´t you?
She is my business partner.
Was your business partner aware of what
you were up to on that Saturday morning?
Not very good for business, is it?
- The relevance of this is...
- The sense of power that must have given you.
To make people stand in a line
and then walk down the line,
making them shake hands with you,
smiling, being charming.
Deciding who would die and who might
live for just a little bit longer.
Very difficult to go back
to your boring little life...
as an optician in
North London after that.
I object to your attempts
to humiliate my client!
Oh, no. This goes to the very
heart of who Mr Jankovic is.
The war gave him a chance to be everything
that he is truly capable of being.
All the normal rules and
social constraints were gone.
That must have been a
terrible shock that morning,
to see that younger
sister walking towards you.
I mean, you´d given orders
that she should be killed.
But then maybe, maybe
a sense of excitement.
The chance to experience
that power again.
I´m an approved police interpreter,
helping both my
community and the police.
And this is how I am treated.
I understand. I am a foreigner.
And I have to live with all the suspición
and prejudice that goes with that.
But I will take my complaints
to the highest police authority.
The very highest.
And I will pursue every
officier who has been involved
in this unfounded attack
on myself and my family.
Hall.
Yup.
No, you did absolutely the right thing.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ!
Do you trust your husband, Mrs Lukic?
Implicitly.
Then would you mind
telling me what he was doing
on the morning of Saturday 20th May?
He was at work.
Do you know a woman called Sarah Ford?
She was with your husband
on that Saturday morning.
The Boston Hotel, Hyde Park,
between 9:30 and 11:45 in the morning.
I mean...
do you really trust him
to tell you the truth?
Oh... Come on.
You´re holding onto something
that you know is slipping away.
He´s lied to you again
and again and again.
You´re innocent.
Just tell us the truth.
What time did your
husband really come home?
What happened to his
clothes? Did he shower?
How did he destroy them? You know
the answers to these questions.
Your husband is in a room
answering the same questions.
If he tells us the truth before you do,
then you are going to
prison for a very long time.
Chief Superintendent Lawrence
Hall has entered the room.
What?
He has handed me a note.
I am terminating this interview. The
time is 14:46. Thank you, Mrs Lukic.
If I went into court
only with that confessión,
which I know is partly
untrue, I´d risk everything.
I have to establish the truth.
This wasn´t evidence against Zigic.
You were going after Lukic.
It´s as if our meeting never took place!
I thought it never did take place.
I was very careful not
to use any information
that I learnt at that meeting.
Why, Jane?
Because those two sisters came to
this country believing it to be safe.
They thought it was a country
where decisions about who
went free and who did not
were decided in open court,
not behind closed doors.
What about the bigger fish
that Lukic can help us bring in?
Well, maybe turning a blind eye
to torture and murder
will bring about bigger, better arrests.
I don´t know. I have
no control over that.
All I can do is deal with
what´s in front of me.
Did it ever cross your
mind you might be wrong?
Yes.
You´re off this investigation.
Take a week´s leave.
God knows what the consequences
of this will be. Come in.
Superintendent Tennison is stepping down.
She´s taking a week´s leave for personal
reasons. I want you to take over.
Er... Yes, sir. Erm...
I´m actually pretty full-on with a
river stabbing at the moment, sir.
Sir.
She will not communicate with you
regarding this investigation. Understood?
Yes, sir.
I want Zigic´s CPS files
for both murders submitted to me ASAP.
And er... what about the other suspect, sir?
There are none.
Thank you.
Madam. Sir.
So, what´s he trading with?
Information?
I didn´t tell you he was
trading with anything.
Well, if you can´t touch him...
and you´re not allowed to tell me
why you can´t touch him, he must be.
There´s no other reason.
If I could have shown them that
he´d murdered, on British soil,
they would have dropped him.
- What?
- I think you´re being naive.
They might not have wanted to look.
But if I´d shoved it down their
throats, they´d have had no choice.
I cocked it up, Robert.
Twice.
Once in the interview room
and again with the squad.
I didn´t...
bring them with me.
The way Hall walked
in... He was tipped off.
Do you know by whom?
I can´t be certain.
How certain are you about Jankovic?
Put it this way,
if I was on a jury presented with
the evidence that I´ve got on him,
I´d let him walk free.
And he´s guilty.
It´s Samira and Jasmina´s funeral tomorrow.
I can´t be there.
Women aren´t allowed.
- Would you go for me?
- Of course.
Tell Jasmina I´m sorry.
Hi. My name is Robert West.
I´m a friend of Inspector Tennison.
She asked me to
represent her here today.
She sends her condolences.
I think we should take
his fucking eyes out first.
- You fucked it up for me!
- Kasim asked questions.
Intelligent, direct, honest questions.
I wasn´t going to lie to him.
I told him what I´d found
out. Nothing came from you.
I didn´t put him up to it.
He came to his own conclusión.
He couldn´t find
justice in this country.
Letting Zigic take the drop on
his own and protecting Jankovic
was an insult to the
two women he murdered.
How´s this going to help them?
I met a few ´´Jankovics´´ in Bosnia.
But I met a lot more ´´Kasims´´.
Broken, stuck, no redress.
The only way he´d have
some kind of peace,
a life with a way forward,
was to feel that justice had been done.
What Kasim and his friends
are doing to Jankovic now,
- is that justice?
- Yes.
- Kasim doesn´t have murder in him.
- What about the other men?
What you´ve set into motion
goes against everything I believe in.
Everything I stand for!
I know.
Taff, I need a favour.
Yeah, we´re here now. Who am I meeting?
So, how´s it going?
What with?
With this case... the river disco stabbing.
We´ve got a few leads. I´m
setting up a reconstruction.
Am I being set up here?
Taffy told me where I could find
you. He doesn´t know why I´m here.
What´s happening with Jankovic?
We´re looking for him.
We know Kasim was involved.
We´ve got some tenuous info.
There´s a slim chance Kasim might try...
and ship him back to Bosnia
for some sort of trial.
We´ve got his cigarette route
through Dover covered.
The source thinks it´ll
be in the next 24 hours.
If we get confirmation,
we´ll move on it.
I think you were doing the right
thing, going after Jankovic.
Well, someone in the squad doesn´t.
They won´t know we´ve met.
So, how´s his wife taking it?
Not good. Not good at all.
I made a mistake.
I thought I could crack her, but...
it was never going to happen.
She was the weak link.
Jankovic made her safe
somehow and I think I know how,
but, of course, I can´t
officially tell you.
I want another crack at her.
Simon, I need your help.
Thank you, ma´am.
- If I could be alone with her.
- Yes.
Thanks.
Mrs Lukic,
I´ve... I´ve come to apologise to you
for the ordeal that I put you through.
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Erm...
I´ve come to...
assure you that everything possible
is being done to find your husband.
He was taken because
of your accusations.
Are you satisfied?
Oh, God, no. Of course
I´m not satisfied.
Your husband´s entitled to a fair trial,
just like anyone else.
You´re still accusing him?
He is still wanted for questioning
concerning two murders, yes.
Would you please leave my house?
You´re not sorry about anything.
Oh, believe me, I am.
Actually...
I´ve seen a lot of cases like yours.
You´re not alone.
You´re in shock from discovering
the truth about your husband.
At first,
you cling on to this idea
of who you thought he was,
who you wanted him to be...
You have no idea about my husband.
No idea at all!
You know,
I came here on my own,
today, on purpose, so we
could speak off the record.
Anything you say to me I can´t use.
You can deny it was ever said.
Please, Mrs Lukic, please, please.
Just give me two minutes, please.
Well, we are trained not to
become personally involved,
but I do...
I just feel this overriding
sense of responsibility...
to protect your two
children from your husband.
You sanctimonious, meddling bitch!
You know nothing about my
husband. Nothing at all.
I think I do, and I do understand
something of the shame you must feel.
Shame? Shame?
You stupid, stupid woman!
I am proud of my husband.
He´s a man of principle.
He´s risked his life to bring
war criminals to justice.
Do you know what moral conviction it
takes to go against your own people,
friends, men who trust you,
to secure what you believe is right?
Oh...
Oh, my God.
Oh, I... I didn´t know.
My husband...
works for the British Government.
He is protected by the British Government.
Now get out of my fucking house!
- How´s it looking?
- Good.
They wouldn´t know an operation´s
going on until well down the line.
Latest intelligence is it´s
still likely to be a white van,
but keep your eye out for anything.
Duscan, I´m not here to
make you say anything.
Your commander Dragan
Jankovic won´t be prosecuted.
Even if you tell the truth about
him, it won´t make any difference.
But I...
I just wanted you to know
who you were protecting.
Excuse me, love. Check this
van for me again, please.
Away from the van, please.
- This is...
- Step away from the van, please, sir.
No, no.
Get the dog away! There are
shrouds in there! Burial shrouds!
Transit van! Pulling away from lane 55!
Back in the cars!
Get in the cars, chaps!
The white van. White
transit van. All units now!
- In the cars! Quick, chaps!
- Right.
Sorry about that, boy!
Come on, let´s go!
- Can you get out, please?
- No, no.
Switch your engine off. Get out, please.
Quickly, get the driver! Quick! Move!
Whoa, whoa! Come on, come on, come on!
In the van, quick!
Nothing.
- Fuck.
- Bollocks.
- You got a crowbar or something there, Taff?
- Yeah.
- Hello, mate.
- You got him?
Thank you. Thank you.
<i>Do you know what moral conviction it

<i>friends, men who trust you, to

<i>My husband... works for

<i>He is protected by

He tipped us off about
where to find you.
He knew we´d come after
you armed with guns.
He was hoping that we´d kill you.
And now he´s hoping that
you´ll stay loyal to him.
Because loyalty is
something you understand.
Don´t you, Duscan Zigic?
But not him.
And that´s the difference between you.
I´m going to destroy that
tape. I was never here.
I never played it to you.
In my language...
it´s called a ´´viadukt´´.
A train that runs in the sky.
Hello, guv. You back?
Yeah.
OK. You keep the copies.
I´ll take the original, OK?
Thank you.
Well done, Lorna,
for following through with this...
Lukic dental ID.
- What does she want those for?
- Don't know.
Here.
We met him off the plane. He
was happy to see us. Grateful.
We were giving him a lift to London.
He was on his way to his new job.
A new life.
Jankovic told me he was a traitor.
And of course...
I believed him.
I´ll need to tell them first.
Tennison isn´t just going ahead?
Jesus Christ!
When will I know where you are?
I´ll have to tell them something.
You´ll know when you get told.
You do nothing, you say nothing.
Children don´t work like that.
They won´t accept
you´ve just disappeared.
Mrs Lukic, as soon as your husband is
settled, you´ll be able to join him.
- Legenda não traduzida -
But you won´t even tell me which country?
That´s them.
Hello again.
Oh, God!
Why don´t you just take
care of these people?
Dragan Jankovic, I´m
arresting you for the murder
of the real Milan Lukic.
The murder occurred eight years ago.
There was a witness to the murder.
The body was exhumed this morning
and is now being formally
identified using dental records.
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence
if you don´t mention...
Put that knife down, sir.
- Let her go!
- No! Milan, no!
Come on, sir. Put her down, please, sir.
Put the knife down, please, sir.
Put her down.
Hold it, lads. Hold it.
Put her down, please, sir.
Put her down.
The knife down. Put it down.
Let her go.
Come on. Look around.
Put her down.
Put the knife down, please, sir.
You don´t have to say anything.
However, it may harm your defence
if you don´t mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.
And you, madam, who might you be?
Don´t ask.
Why couldn´t you leave us alone?
