(children, one very loud)
 O little town of Bethlehem
 How still we see thee lie
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
 The silent stars go by
Just the right half, please.
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth
 The everlasting light
The other half.
(girl sings very loudly)
 The hopes and fears of all the years
 Are met in thee tonight
You three, sing.
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth
 The everlasting light
 The hopes and fears of all the years
(very loudly)  Are met in thee tonight
Thank you. That will be all.
Honey, why don't you...
Shut up.
I don't recall asking
for a second opinion.
Sing a bit softer.
(girl) Singing(!) Yeah.
(boy) Sounds worse
than when I kick my dog.
(children howl like wolves)
(squeals like a pig)
(children)  Silent night
 Holy night
 All is calm
 All is bright
(woman) And the moon shone
with a special brightness,
and, as if by magic,
animals who were natural enemies,
when they saw it, lay down together.
The leopard with the chicken,
the lion with the lamb.
(loudly)  Sleep in heavenly peace
..which is why many believe today that
when the moon is full on Christmas Eve,
it offers a magical time of peace,
a blessing on the world.
(children sing "Silent Night")
(woman) And guided by a star,
the wise men...
Don't pull it!
Guided by a star,
the wise men came bearing gifts -
gold and spices from the Orient,
oils and silk.
 Christ the Saviour is born
Up a little bit! A little more.
- All the way up.
- (man) Come on, guys.
(girl) Oh, look. Santa's reindeer.
Now, Dasher. Now, Dancer.
Now, Prancer...
There's a car.
Now, Dasher. Now, Dancer.
- Now, Prancer...
- Get out of the street.
(loudly) Now, Dasher. Now, Dancer. Now...
(man) Watch it!
Prancer!
(man) I told the council
these decorations were too old.
(woman) Almost went right through
that man's windshield.
Looks like Santa's only gonna have
seven reindeer this year.
(man) Up and out, people.
Let's clear the street.
Don't want any accidents.
Let's clear the street.
Aren't you gonna fix him?
Aren't you gonna fix him?
They gotta fix him.
Santa needs all his reindeer.
Maybe he can't fly without Prancer.
It's not the real Prancer. It's just wood.
I know that. It's just wood.
- (man) It's got a lot of hours on it.
- (man #2) That tractor's three years old.
- I can only give you 1900.
- It's worth twice that.
- I know you're having a rough time...
- Dad!
Guess what. A reindeer fell and almost
went right through a man's windshield.
Not now!
(man #2) It's my best offer.
Take it or leave it.
Leave it.
- What are you dressed up for?
- It was the Christmas pageant today.
Remember?
Yeah. How'd it go?
- Good.
- That's good.
Sean Griswald was supposed to carry
the baby Jesus, but he lost it.
They had to wrap up a bunch of rags
and use that instead.
(giggles)
Dad, are we poor?
No, we're not poor.
We're just down on our luck.
Will we be up on our luck?
I'm doing everything I can.
I could help if you let me.
You're just a little girl.
- Are we gonna starve?
- No, of course not.
Stop worrying about these things,
will you? We're gonna be all right.
We got apples.
We're gonna eat apple sauce
and apple cider and apple pie.
And there's stewed apples and
baked apples and dried apples.
Apple butter.
Heck, no, we're not gonna starve.
Hi, Aunt Sarah.
- Steve, can you fix my sled?
- No.
- No?
- No!
Oh!
( "We Wish You A Merry Christmas")
- (Aunt Sarah) Dinner!
- Coming!
Wheesh! Wheesh!
Clop, clop. Wheesh!
- There'll be a full moon this Christmas.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.
Sorry.
- There's bound to be magic happening.
- Give me a break.
- You don't know anything about it.
- There is something about a full moon.
Nancy Hooper at the hospital says
whenever there's a full moon,
the patients on the eight floor -
the mental patients -
they all start acting up like crazy.
Really? How?
Why don't you go there on Christmas Eve
and find out? They'll show you magic.
Why are you so nasty?
If you wanna eat like an animal,
take your food out to the barn.
- (door closes)
- (father) It's not easy on me,
- not being able to provide for her.
- You do provide for her.
Can't even get a bank loan any more.
(door slams)
- Have you told her yet, John?
- (sighs)
- You've got to.
- I know! I know.
I still don't see why
she's been coming over so much lately.
She's your aunt. She's trying to help out.
She asked Dad if he'd told me yet.
Told me what?
- Maybe they're gonna get married.
- She's married to my Uncle Arnold.
Maybe they were talking about
a surprise - a Christmas present for you.
Santa's the one
who brings all the presents.
All right. Santa Claus.
You know it's true.
My mother told me and she'd never lie.
Let's not talk about it any more
right now, though.
There's some serious sledding
to be done.
- We're the first ones.
- The only ones crazy enough to do this.
Watch out!
(screaming happily)
Here, you! This is private property!
Get off my property!
Steer away! Turn!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Don't you come here, you hooligans!
(screams)
Go away, you...
- You hit me and you'll go to juvenile hall!
- (screaming)
Oh! Oh!
Oh, my floribundas. Oh!
You animals!
Oh, my floribundas!
You rascal! I'll get even with you!
I'll catch you! I'll catch you, you...
- Hurry! Come on!
- I'll get you!
Terrorist! Terrorist!
- Think she recognised us?
- I don't think so.
- See you tomorrow.
- OK. Bye.
(hums "Deck the Hall")
(wind howls)
- (icicle tinkles)
- (gasps)
(bird squawks)
(twig snaps)
I've never seen one like you.
You're not afraid of me.
(reindeer bellows)
Dad, I just saw a deer in the woods!
- Come in here.
- It was interesting!
It was so big. It looked like a giant!
It was so weird. You would never imagine.
- I told you not to go near McFarland's.
- Will you listen?
She says you ruined her flower bushes.
Guess who's gonna pay for those.
- But, Dad!
- I want you to stay away from there!
Looked just like the one in my room.
Hey!
D'you hear me?
Yeah, I do, Dad.
I believe you saw a deer in the woods.
There's lots of 'em around.
But I don't believe it was Santa's,
and I don't believe it flies.
It looked just like this one, Prancer.
See the white mark on its forehead?
Remember it was Prancer
that fell down on Main Street?
That's right, it was.
So is this one. I have a magazine
that had all the reindeers lined up.
I cut them out and this is the order.
This is Prancer and this is, um...
Prancer, Dancer... Pran...
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer.
This is Vixen and this is Prancer.
Are you going to eat your pickle?
The moon's almost full.
It'll be full on Christmas Eve.
Don't you see? It all fits together.
The problem is, Jessie...
I don't believe in Santa Claus any more.
- What?
- I mean, think about it.
How could one man climb down all
the chimneys in the world in one night?
He's magical, Carol.
- It doesn't make sense.
- Well, not everything can be explained.
I've never seen Santa Claus.
And I've done a lot of looking.
You've never seen God either.
Does that mean there's no God?
How do we know about that for sure?
Because if there's no God,
there's no heaven.
Well, maybe there isn't.
All right for you, Carol Wetherby.
You're not my friend any more!
What did I say?
- That there was no heaven.
- So?
What about my mother, then?
(Carol) I said I'm sorry. Jessie, come on!
I was just kidding. I believe in Santa
Claus, OK? I believe in God and in heaven.
- Do you believe it was Prancer?
- Yes.
I don't believe you.
There's my mom.
She's taking me Christmas shopping.
Talk to you later.
- (teacher) Where are your boots?
- (man) Get in the front seat.
Move. Hurry up or you'll miss the bus.
- (gunshot)
- (gasps)
(gunshot)
(John) Get in here!
Come on.
I talk and I talk,
and you just don't listen, do you?
What are you doing
out there by yourself?
- Looking for the reindeer.
- Don't go into the woods this time of year.
A hunter'll shoot you.
- Where were you going, Daddy?
- Just groceries.
You know, looking at
some feed and things.
I heard you and Aunt Sarah
talking the other night.
What does "told me yet" mean?
- What?
- What does "told me yet" mean?
Oh, baby.
It's just not right when a little girl's
gotta grow up without a mom around.
We've been talking about
maybe you going to live with her.
No, Daddy, please. I don't wanna do that.
I know you don't.
This is hard for me to do
but I gotta think about what's best for you.
- You're what's best for me.
- I'm not.
Can't buy you things you want.
Can't give you an education.
Sarah'll be able to do those things.
Please, Daddy.
Please.
I want to stay with you.
Daddy, l...
I know we argue, but...
Please, Daddy, please.
Us arguing hasn't got
anything to do with it.
It's just not right that
I'm away from the house so much.
Send Steve if someone has to go.
He's older than you. I need his help.
- I help too.
- I know.
I can do everything he does. He'll get too
old for work. I can take his place. Please.
- You'll only be 30 miles away.
- 30 miles?! That's a billion, two trillion!
Calm down, will you? Families do this
for each other all the time.
They help each other out when things get
tough, and things are tough for me now.
I'm gonna run away if she comes for me.
- I don't wanna hear you talk like that.
- She comes, and you'll never find me.
- Stop it, Jessica.
- Dad, look out!
- It's him!
- Wait. Stay here.
- He's hurt, Daddy.
- Stay away from him.
(bellows)
We gotta help him.
- Daddy, no!
- It's hurt.
- It's been wounded.
- No!
Let go.
You can't. It's the one I saw. It's Santa's.
He's just gonna suffer.
No! I hate you! I hate you!
All right, you hate me, you hate me.
I'm gonna look over this way.
Don't even think about it.
This is gonna stop.
(thud)
(thudding)
(thud)
(rustling)
(grunt)
You're here.
How did you know where I lived?
- Do you want me to help you?
- (groans)
I won't hurt you.
(grunts and sniffs)
Are you hungry?
I gotta get you outta here.
Dad'll shoot you if he sees you.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- It's OK.
- (cow moos)
Come on.
Come on.
I know what'll get you outta here.
Come on.
It's a Christmas cookie.
Come on. Come on, you can do it.
(groans)
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
You can do it.
That's it. That's it.
Come on, over here.
Come on.
I'll get more cookies,
but you gotta come in here first.
Come on. Come on.
(bellows)
(groans)
You gotta let me.
I'll get more help,
but you gotta stay here till then.
- Come on! We're gonna miss our bus!
- Coming.
- Forgot the dishes last night, Jessica.
- Sorry, Dad.
Something's been eating our little trees.
- (Steve) Which?
- The little chestnuts.
- What do you think it was?
- I don't know.
From the looks of the droppings,
I'd say it might have been a deer.
- Must have been hungry to eat wood.
- Wood, that's what they eat.
If I see 'em doing it, they'll by eating lead.
See you, Dad.
(horn)
- Forgot my homework.
- Too late now.
- I gotta.
- Then you're gonna have to walk.
Go ahead.
- See you later.
- Not if I see you first.
(cow moos)
This isn't a healthy breakfast, but it will
have to do until I can get you some hay.
And you did eat our little trees.
Oh, Prancer, you're getting worse
and worse. I'm going for some help.
- (pig squeals)
- Agh!
- You OK?
- (Jessie) Dr Benton!
Dr Benton!
Dr Ben...
Whatever it is can wait till tomorrow.
I've been up all night.
Can't wait. Emergency!
Please. Just come, please.
I've brought someone
to help you, Prancer.
Oh, my God. It's a reindeer.
- You tricked me into this.
- Uh-uh.
I said there was an animal that needs your
help, and that's true. I think he's dying.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, I can't.
You're a doctor,
you're supposed to help animals.
Domestic animals. I thought it was a cow.
- But he'll die.
- Talk to Mother Nature.
Dr Benton, this is very, very...
Dagh! Oh!
You have no idea!
No.
He'll die.
- Let go of my truck.
- But he's one of Santa's.
Prancer, actually.
I'm so glad to hear that.
- It is.
- Would you please stop...
And if you don't help, he'll never
make it back home by Christmas.
- Maybe there won't even be a Christmas.
- Your dad's going to hear about this.
Young lady, I was up half the night
with a pregnant cow and a crazy horse.
I'm tired. My hand hurts. I've got
a sick wife to tend to. I can't help...
But I tell you, he's one of Santa's.
Then call Santa!
And let go of my car.
Probably couldn't help him anyways.
Doctors are just liars.
They never make anyone better!
- Is he gonna be OK?
- Too soon to tell.
Should take a while to heal.
Hold his head away from me.
I really don't think this is necessary. He's
probably used to being around people.
What am l? An elf? Hold his head down.
And keep on that on after I leave,
you hear? They bite.
(reindeer grunts)
Isn't he the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?
Like a cow... with antlers.
Don't know what a reindeer's
doing this far south.
Must have escaped from that
Christmas show over at Riverdale.
- I'll give 'em a call.
- No.
I don't want anybody to know, especially
Dad. I don't think he'd understand.
I gotta give 'em a call just in case.
But I'll make you a deal.
I'll give you a couple of days
to tell your father yourself.
Deal.
- History's gonna love you for this.
- Oh!
- Go to school.
- School!
(grunts)
I don't know what you're thinking about.
Your head's always off in the clouds.
You don't just show up for school
when you feel like it!
- All I missed was finger painting, and...
- That's the very thing I'm worried about!
I gotta go off to Ben Harbor tonight and
who knows what you're gonna get up to?
You gonna tell me why you were late?
- Are you listenin' to me?
- No.
- You're not?
- I mean...
I'm not gonna tell you
why I was late for school.
Fine. Have it your way.
(phone)
(whispers) Hello. Mr Benton?
This is Jessica Riggs.
Yeah, well. Yes. What? What?
Jessica Riggs.
- Did you call the Christmas show?
- Yes. It's not theirs.
Thanks, sir. I knew it.
Darnedest thing.
Where did that deer come from?
(Steve)..to baby-sit my crazy sister.
I've got her locked in her room, so l
probably could sneak outta the house.
She's on a mission
to find some reindeer.
My dad almost made a road pizza
out of him, but she thinks he can fly.
No, not my dad, the reindeer.
Supper time.
This is the part I told you about.
"You tear apart the baby's rattle
and see what makes the noise inside,
but there is a veil
covering the unseen world
which not the strongest man
could tear apart."
"No Santa Claus?!"
"Thank God he lives, and lives forever."
"A thousand years from now,
ten times ten thousand years from now,
he will continue to make glad
the heart of childhood."
I can't read as good as my mom did,
but you understand what it means, right?
I bet Santa doesn't think
you'll get back in time.
I better let him know.
(grunts softly)
I love you, Prancer.
But... what about me? Do you love me?
Say "cheese".
- Did you get that?
- Ho-ho-ho, little buddy.
Course I did. Let's see.
Skeletor, slime pit,
skateboard and... handcuffs.
- Right!
- Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas.
Oh! You're gettin' kinda heavy
for Santa's lap, aren't you, little girl?
Ho-ho-ho-ho.
I don't have any time for chitchat.
I know you're not the real Santa.
Course I am!
But can you get this letter to him?
Why don't you just put a stamp on it
and drop it in the mailbox?
It's too late for that. Please believe me,
this is a matter of utmost importance.
Prancer's in the shed near my house!
I plan to take him to Antler Ridge
on December 23, midnight.
All that's in the letter?
Here's a picture of him. That way,
Santa'll know you're telling the truth.
- D'you think he'd doubt me?
- Admit it, you're not the real Santa.
OK, OK. Keep it to yourself.
Can you help me?
Hmm.
I'll do everything I possibly can.
- Thanks.
- Wait a minute, now.
Is that all you want for Christmas?
For now anyways.
I don't wanna live with my aunt, but I don't
know if Santa can do anything about that.
Can we hurry it along a little bit, Santa?
- Yes, sir.
- OK.
(woman) Go on, honey. It's your turn.
Go on up there. Quick. There you go.
Agh!
Well, and what do you want for Christmas,
you little devil, you?
(man) Put the Minot robbery on three,
the farmers on welfare story on five.
I got somethin' to cheer you up, pal.
This'd be perfect for tomorrow's edition.
You've gotta swear, Carol.
I said I would.
Cross your heart,
swear not to tell. If you do...
I swear!
- You ready?
- I'm ready. I'm ready!
Oh, my God!
It's Prancer. Go ahead, pet him.
No, it's OK.
I don't like animals that much anyway.
(Steve) Come on, that's not an animal.
What are you doing here?
It's a bird. It's a plane. It's a hat rack.
It's a reindeer, you nerd.
(Steve) Looks like
enough meat to last the winter.
Whoa!
Hurt me. My knees are shakin'.
- Tell Dad, I'll never speak to you again.
- Is that a promise?
Dad! Oh, Dad! Hey, Dad! Guess...
- Shut up, Steve.
- Shut up?
I'll make a deal. You don't tell Dad and I'll
clean out the barn till the end of the year.
- You're lousy at cleaning the barn.
- Name your price, then.
Hm.
I don't wanna wash any dishes till June.
Deal.
By the way, I wouldn't take
any more feed from the barn if I were you.
Now look, Steve, he has to eat.
- Then you guys can buy him some oats.
- With what?
- I don't know.
- You wanna give us some money?
You know, Dad's noticed the missing hay.
He thinks it's the deer getting in.
Says he's gonna be waiting...
- Don't say the word.
-..with his gun. (imitates gunshot)
(Steve) See you, Prancer. Bye, Carol.
I only need two more days. Then I'll take
him to Antler Ridge and Santa'll get him.
- He will?
- I sent him a letter. It's all worked out.
Kid isn't playing with a full deck.
Listen, nobody - and I mean nobody -
but us three can know about Prancer.
Don't worry. I wouldn't want
anybody to find out you're nuts.
Prancer, I have no cookies. If you didn't
eat so fast you'd still have some hay left.
Where am I gonna get the money for oats?
They cost something like $15 a bag.
Don't look at me.
I spent all mine on Christmas presents.
Maybe we can earn it.
We're on vacation, we can get jobs.
Don't worry, Prancer.
I won't let you starve.
(John) Jessie.
Your Aunt Sarah's gonna be
staying over the next two nights.
She wants to take you
to church on Sunday.
And Christmas shopping tomorrow.
I can't tomorrow.
I got something important to do.
You stay with your Aunt Sarah.
I gotta go to town on business.
I don't wanna come back and hear
you've been giving her a hard time.
(creaks)
What do you want?
I came to apologise for trespassing
and for... messing up your flowers.
I should think so. This isn't the first time
you hooligans have torn up my property.
I know. I'm really sorry.
You should see my creeping bent.
In the summer, what they do!
I know. I know.
Anyway, ma'am, I'm sorry.
Don't do it again, or I'll be forced
to notify the juvenile authorities.
I'm sure you wouldn't enjoy
a month or two in reform school.
No, ma'am.
No. While I'm here, ma'am.
I'm raising money for
a good cause, and, well...
I'd be willing to do chores
for you for half-price.
Raising money?
For what cause?
An animal shelter.
What kind of chores? And how much?
I'll clean any room in your house,
top to bottom, for five dollars.
Any room?
Any room.
I've been meaning to fix this up
for quite a while now.
This looks like a ten-dollar job.
You said any room for five dollars.
Now, this goes upstairs.
This goes upstairs.
You can leave this here.
These go out back.
These go in the closet under the stairs.
This goes up in the top floor.
Oh.
These are still good.
Keep that over there.
This room needs a big dusting.
These books, put them in the bookcase.
And this might help. No, it... Ugh!
(sighs)
Come on.
Little girl?
(cat meows)
Little girl?
Little girl?
Little girl?
Are you playing a game on me?
Surprise!
- What's all this?
- Aren't they beautiful?
Pack these up right away.
- Why?
- No, I don't want them. Pack them up.
But don't you like them?
No, I don't.
You used to win the awards for decorating
your house. People came from miles...
Why do I want people
trampling everything?
- Because you have a beautiful house.
- I'm not doing it any more.
Please.
Please?
To the left.
No. My left!
Five dollars. And...
Ten dollars. Fifteen dollars.
We agreed on five.
I know, but...
you did fifteen dollars' worth of work.
- Thanks, Mrs McFarland.
- Let's go in for those cookies and milk.
No. I gotta go.
You said you were gonna stay awhile.
I've got something important to do.
Fine. Be that way!
I was so worried. I looked for her all day.
She took off and she didn't say a word.
I'll talk to her. It's spite.
(Jessie) Dear Santa Claus,
Don't worry about Prancer,
he's in good hands.
He was hurt, but I helped him to get well.
I will bring him to you
at the top of Antler Ridge
at midnight on Sunday,
the night before Christmas Eve.
That way, you will have plenty of time.
If you don't want me to see you,
I'll close my eyes.
But I do wanna see you.
Love, Jessica Riggs.
How is it, honey? Does it fit you?
Very well, thank you.
Ten minutes.
(boy) Come on, man, hurry up!
Oh, my God!
Here he is.
- He's big.
- Oh, wow. He's rad.
- OK, Quinn, what are you doing here?
- Just wanted to see the famous Prancer.
Prancer? Who told you?
- Nobody. I just saw...
- I'm gonna strangle that Carol.
- Look at his weird feet.
- And those eyes.
- He's so ugly.
- Yeah.
Out! Come on!
Take it easy. What's wrong with you?
- Out! Out!
- She's crazy, man.
I'm gonna slice you all into pieces!
Go! Get away!
Get! Get! Get!
Shoo! And never come back again!
You're not ugly, Prancer.
Don't let those creeps bother you.
I'm gonna strangle that Carol.
All right for her.
(car horn)
You better get that reindeer
out of the shed.
I am, tonight. Soon everyone's gonna
know about him. I can't believe Carol told.
- Hello, Jessica.
- Hi, Mrs Fairburn.
Aunt Sarah,
this is my teacher, Mrs Fairburn.
Hello.
- You must be so proud of her.
- We always are.
I wanna hear all about it.
I'll talk to you after church.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Merry Christmas.
Well, well, well, well, well.
You have added inspiration
to my day, young lady.
- What'd you do? Hand out money?
- I have no idea what they're talking about.
(minister)..that brought from the dead
our Lord Jesus, through the covenant,
make you perfect in
every good work to do his will,
working in you that
which is pleasing in his sight.
Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord, amen.
(organ)
 Hark! the herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!"
 "Peace on earth and mercy mild
 God and sinners reconciled"
 Joyful, all ye nations, rise
(Jessie loudly)
 Join the triumph of the skies
 With th'angelic host proclaim
 "Christ is born in Bethlehem"
 Hark! the herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!"
(minister) "And the angel
of the Lord came upon them,
and the glory of the Lord shone round
about them: and they were sore afraid."
"And the angel said unto them, Fear not."
(horse whinnies)
What's the matter, Ralph?
(church organist plays
"How Great Thou Art")
 O Lord, my God
 In thy awesome wonder
 Consider all the worlds
thy hands have made
 I see the stars
 I hear the rolling thunder
 Thy power throughout
the universe displayed
 Then sings my soul
 My saviour, God, to thee
 How great thou art
 How great thou art
 Then sings my soul
 My saviour, unto thee
 How great thou art
 How great thou art
And now a final community note.
We have someone very special
in our congregation this morning.
Those of you who have read this Sunday's
newspaper know who I'm talking about.
But for those of you who haven't,
I'd like to read part of an editorial
that appears in the Family section.
It may help to inspire you
in the same way that it did me.
"ln an electronic age, where children
are growing up light years faster
than their ancestors
ever dreamed possible,
where the harsh realities of life have
invaded the most idyllic of communities,
it is inspiring that some children can hold
on to their dreams and innocent spirit."
"Yes, Santa, there are
still Virginias in this world."
"We have one right here in Three Oaks."
"She's nursing the spirit
of Christmas back to health
the same way as she's nursed
your missing reindeer back to health."
"Please stop by soon to collect Prancer.
Until then, he's in good hands."
"Three Oaks is in good hands as long
as we have children like Jessica Riggs,
with all their sense of wonder and belief."
"We need that belief. The world needs it."
"May it live forever."
Oh, man!
Oh, no. Dad's probably
reading it right now.
You...!
Whoa, Janet!
Dumb cow.
(excited chattering)
(children) Prancer! Where's Prancer?
- Nobody's here.
- Hope you don't mind us barging in.
- Oh, no.
- (child) There he is!
(girl) There he is.
Hey, guys, look. He's over here.
He's in the house.
(woman) He's got a gun!
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
I wanna make a proposition to you, John.
Holy cow!
Oh, no. He's gone.
- Daddy, did you kill him?
- Had that deer out in that shed all week.
- Tell us, Daddy.
- That's why you skipped school.
Stealing food from the barn, telling lies.
Then I find a 40lb sack of oats out there
with a Christmas bow on it!
D'you steal that too?
- No. She bought it with...
- You in on this too? I'll get you later.
Daddy!
Sit down to read the newspaper
and all heck breaks loose.
Darned deer lets the stock out
and then comes into the house!
Got too much on my mind for all this.
You're making me nuts.
- Tell me you didn't shoot it.
- I didn't shoot it.
- You didn't?
- No, I didn't.
- Really?
- No, I didn't.
Oh, thank you, Daddy! Did he run away?
Did he go to Antler Ridge?
He's down at Three Oaks. I sold him.
- Sold him?
- To Herb Drier.
He offered me $200
to take him off my hands.
Mr Drier? The butcher?
Daddy, he'll eat him!
- No, he won't.
- He'll cut him up and sell the pieces.
- Stop it.
- No, I won't.
You don't understand what you've done.
He's one of Santa's.
- Come on, Jessie.
- Mom would have never done this.
Look, reindeer don't fly. OK? I hate to be
the one to tell you that but they don't.
I wish she was here instead of you!
Die! I'm gonna die!
Oh, John.
You really didn't do that, did you?
- Where is he, Mr Drier?
- Where's who?
- Prancer.
- Over there.
Prancer.
You're alive.
I saved his life. Now he's my
best salesman. Aren't you, fella?
(phone)
Nobody answer that.
I'm tired of having to explain to
everybody why I sold that reindeer.
May I be excused, please?
Yes, you may.
Sorry about the mess
he made in the house.
I'll do the dishes after everyone's through.
(gasps)
- Where do you think you're going?
- None of your beeswax.
You're heading for town at night in a
snowstorm and it's none of my business?
- You're gonna try and spring Prancer.
- What if I am?
I just wonder why you need
a sack full of clothes to do it.
Come on, Jessie.
What are the clothes for?
You're gonna tell me what you're doin'
or I'm gonna go get Dad.
- I'm not coming back.
- Boy, that's just great.
Come on, Jessie, come back to the house.
Come on, don't be crazy.
Hey!
Are you gonna make me drag you?
Go ahead, drag me.
I'll just find another way to leave.
- Am I the only sane one in this family?
- I won't ever, ever live with Aunt Sarah.
Aunt Sarah?
Dad wants to send me there
and I really don't wanna go.
He does? Why is everyone keeping me
in the dark about everything?
- I didn't think you'd care.
- I do.
- I thought maybe you might be glad.
- No. Come on back. We'll work this out.
- Dad doesn't want me.
- Sure he does.
- He doesn't treat me right.
- He's just mixed up right now.
He doesn't love me,
doesn't understand me.
He doesn't understand you all the time.
I don't either.
But that doesn't mean I don't love you.
- Come on home. I'm tired of talking.
- I can't, Steve.
With Prancer gone,
there's nothing left for me in this town.
Bye, Steve.
Figured you might need
some help with the jailbreak.
Don't think I'll try and
talk you out of running away.
Whatever you wanna do's fine with me.
Thanks, Steve.
We gotta hurry.
Bert makes his rounds every
half an hour. You be the lookout.
- Where were you?
- I didn't see it.
- Get back to your post.
- The snow's too thick for looking out.
If you don't get back to your post,
we're going home.
Hey, Steve! Up here!
What are you doing?
What the heck are you doing?
Prying the roof off
so Prancer can jump out.
It's too high for you,
and it's too high for him.
He's Prancer, Steve.
We may even get to see him fly.
Get down!
No!
Come on, Prancer.
Come on.
You're all better now. There's nothing
holding you back. Prancer, come on!
We don't have much time,
it's quarter to twelve.
Prancer, come on!
Look, Steve. He's gonna fly.
He's gonna fly!
Steve, look!
It's Bert! Stay put.
Maybe he won't see you in all the snow.
Hey, Prancer.
How you doin' tonight, huh?
Nice weather we're havin' here, huh?
How about that? Yeah.
We'll see you on our next run. I'll bring
you somethin' real good to eat, too. OK?
OK.
See you later.
Stay put. I'm coming up.
Jessie! Jessie!
Bert! Bert! Bert, wait! Bert!
Bert! Wait, Bert! Stop!
Bert, my sister's hurt. Wait!
Bert!
(John) Are you sure? I think maybe she
came home from the hospital too soon.
I know the x-rays turned out all right.
She's still not feeling well.
Things are blurry when she looks at 'em.
She doesn't wanna get out of bed. She
don't wanna play her Christmas records.
You don't understand. My daughter
plays Christmas records all year.
Yeah, OK.
I will.
How are you feeling, honey?
Things still look a little funny to you?
Sort of.
When your uncle and I come over
for Christmas dinner,
we'll all get bundled up
and we'll go and see Prancer.
Don't wanna see that deer any more.
What on earth are you talking about?
Everyone was right. Don't know why
it took me so long to listen.
I don't understand, Jessie.
It's just a deer, Aunt Sarah.
What would make you say such a thing?
After all that you've done for him.
After what he did for you last night.
Why, I bet Santa's
coming to get him tonight.
You don't have to pretend.
Dad's right. I'm almost nine years old.
Time I grew up a little.
Hey, John. How are you?
What you doin' down here?
Just checking on the reindeer.
- Go up to your house cos there's a party...
- Uh-uh.
Dumb!
- It was supposed to be a surprise party.
- A what?
Just between you and l,
it's a party for Jessie.
So we'll see you out there. OK?
- Yeah. Sure I'll be there.
- OK.
Yeah.
Don't hit me in front of people.
I outrank you, you know.

 Good tidings for Christmas

Found this at the Christmas tree lot.
Haven't got much
to give you this Christmas.
- That's OK, Daddy.
- No, it isn't.
It isn't.
(sniffs) But I've been thinking.
Maybe we could, uh...
do some of things we used to do.
You know? Before.
On other Christmases.
You know that old sleigh?
Remember the rides we used
to take in it every Christmas?
Maybe we could hook it up
to old Ralph and do that tomorrow.
I'd like that, Daddy.
Found this out in the shed.
- What?
- Read it. Just this part. It's my favourite.
"You tear apart the baby's rattle and
you see what makes the noise inside,
but there is a veil
covering the unseen world
which not the strongest man
could tear apart."
"Only faith, poetry, love and romance
can push aside that curtain
and view the beauty
and the glory beyond."
"ls it all real?"
"Virginia, in all this world
there is nothing else real and abiding."
"No Santa Claus?"
"Thank God he lives, and lives forever."
"A thousand years from now,
ten times ten thousand years from now,
he will continue to make glad
the heart of childhood."
I didn't really wanna run away.
I just...
I just wanted... you to... find me,
and... bring me back here,
and... tell me things were gonna be OK.
Like they used to be.
Ah, Jessie...
I can't tell you
everything's gonna be all right.
I wish I could. But I know things
are always gonna be hard around here.
Could even be
we'll lose this farm someday.
I could bear that.
What I can't bear is the...
When you were gone last night,
I saw what it'd be like around here
not to have you around.
I love you, Jessie.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry.
I love you too, Dad.
All right, baby.
It's OK. Don't cry.
You're home, honey,
and that's where you're gonna stay.
I got something I wanna show you.
How'd you get him?
Tracked Herb down
and gave him his money back.
I think we still got time
to get him out to Antler Ridge.
Santa hasn't been to Three Oaks yet.
We don't have to.
I know he's really not Prancer.
You'll have a lot of trouble convincing
all those people downstairs of that.
Out of the way. We got a reindeer
to get to Antler Ridge by midnight.
I don't think this is a good idea.
The doctor said that she could get
outta bed, but she still needs her rest.
I know what she needs, Sarah. And from
now on she's gonna be gettin' more of it.
I wish I could keep you
for just my own pet.
I'll always remember you, Prancer.
I love you.
Thanks, Prancer, for everything.
Look, honey.
Where'd he go?
I don't know. He just disappeared.
He couldn't have jumped and live.
Maybe he flew.
This would be a good place
for Santa to come and get him.
The moon is full.
And it is Christmas Eve.
Listen.
Maybe you'll hear his bells.
(distant tinkling)
I hear them.
I hear them, Daddy. I do.
Goodbye, Prancer. Goodbye.
Remember me.
