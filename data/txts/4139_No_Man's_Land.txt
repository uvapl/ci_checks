It's a story about animals.
The story took place in a barren land.
I hate to bring up about animals...
...but one of my high school teacher...
...always loved about telling
a story on ancient monkeys.
He said there were two monkeys...
...in order not to be eaten by tigers...
...While they are picking up peaches,
they decided to cooperate.
First monkey would go up and pick,
the second monkey looks out for the first monkey.
In return, the first monkey would
give half of the food t0 the second monkey.
However, the sentry monkey could never leave it's duty.
It requires those two monkeys...
...sh0u1d never only think about itself.
As a result,
Those two monkeys become a group of monkeys.
This group of monkeys become human beings.
Our story starts with this bird.
Ay!
Give me a cigarette.
Do you know Muhammad?
He's an Arabian prince.
I hunted this falcon for him.
Cost him a million RMB.
See, you take half of the money...
...and let me go with the other half
Sounds good?
Ok, never mind
It's all yours if you're letting me go.
Keep talking.
Hello. Do you hear things?
Hello!
You are good person,
but good things don't always happen to good people!
Hey!
Are you nuts?
You almost ran me over!
Brain-dead asshole.
I tried to reason with him.
HQ', Say something!
<i>HQ' '</i>
Is there anyone?
Hey, What's going on?
We're fucked...
...there's only one road out...
...and both sides are gonna be blocked.
We can't run out of this.
Take the falcon and just go. I'll call the police.
When I become a lawyer,
I recall the monkey story.
And I just Want to tell my teacher,
humans are not really humans...
...until they learned to use fire,
not because they abandoned selfishness.
Hey! Come here!
The car is broken!
<i>Hey hey hey , hi' s g0'.!</i>
Hi, greeting!
Hello.
I'm Pan Xiao.
We've spoken on the phone.
I pretty much understand your situations.
There are two more questions I need to ask.
Do you think you could handle this?
There are two things I'd like to mention.
First of all, I took ten hours train to here.
But What I didn't know is to arrive here,
I have to take another 3 hours hourse carriage.
I am not asking for money,
I am talking about opportunity cost.
We can always earn more money,
but when times gone, they're gone forever.
Do you think you could handle this?
Please, listen t0 me first.
Consider this a new habit,
because We're gonna do the exactly thing on couryOK?
Secondly,
your case is kind of complicated.
I can't know for sure that we could Win.
Therefore,
the payment of the remaining fund is important.
It seems you can handle this.
When I am going back,
I am not gonna take hourse carriage anymore right?
I never loved animals.
I expecially hate hourses.
It's clear What happened.
The defendant murdered a police officer...
...While poaching protected birds.
The prosecution rests.
Will the defense please begin?
Thank you, Your Honor.
We don't hear a single Word...
...fr0m my defendant on this tape.
So, I don't understand What this so-called evidence...
...has to do with my client.
I'll show you!
Altai falcon feathers were in the vehicle.
I suspect...
You say you "suspect" you "think"
...but that's not enough.
The law requires proof.
What you're providing are clues, not proof.
Let me demonstrate "proof" .
Officer Wang,
on the day of the crime,
did you have lunch with the victim?
Yes.
Did you consume alcohol?
I don't remember.
I present to the court...
...the receipt for the meal.
Officer Wang ate with the victim at Dafudi restaurant.
It has your signature.
Thank you.
You ordered roasted lamb...
...one bottle of Songzhuang liquor,
and four bottles of beer.
Quite a lot of alcohol.
So, We can only conclude...
...that your consumption of alcohol...
...Was the direct cause of this accident.
And Officer Wang, frankly,
you're an indirect cause of this tragedy.
Say that again!
You know very Well What happened that day!
I've had enough of your bullshit!
Objection! Your honor.
This is personal attack!
You're a good lawyer,
and a friend I'd like t0 make.
I'm sorry,
my liver has some functional disorder.
That's Why I don't drink.
If you're satisfied With the results of the ease,
let's make the best of our time...
Well, let's wrap this up.
I'll wire the rest of your money...
...int0 your account Within ten days.
C'm0n, you shouldn't screw with lawyers.
It's ten days.
Do you know how much
effective time people have in their lives?
Outside of sleeping, eating, and bullshitting,
It comes out to a little over 100,000 hours.
And you actually Want me to Wait 1() days.
That car.
Do you see it?
It's a little too red, isn't it?
My Wife liked it.
I Went away on business this year...
...and when I came back,
I heard she'd had an accident.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
But I bought the color anyway
Because I promised her I Would.
So, rest assured.
People like me...
<i>Amend to keep the promises.</i>
How much is your car Worth?
It seems your Wife doesn't need it anymore huh?
So you should leave me the ear as collateral.
You can't have...
...the car.
Really?
Look here.
I've signed this receipt.
It proves that
I bought this bottle of alcohol.
But who can tell...
...that I actually have been drinking?
So.
You really Want the car huh?
Here. Sign.
Do you believe...
...I ran into that police car...
<i>. .</i> intentionally?
Or not?
Sorry.
That's outside of my professional competence.
You're a good lawyer.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, pal!
There's only one road out of this place, right?
That's What it looks like.
I need to see your license.
Name?
Pan Xiao
Occupation?
I thought you knew?
Answer the question!
Lawyer.
Can I g0?
You only lost a conviction.
Is it Worth the anger?
<i>X sweat to god...</i>
...if I weren't a cop, I'd kick your ass.
Too bad you're a cop.
Thank you sir.
What the fuck are you?

Really.
One thousand five hundred yuan.
Man.
Don't you think that's a little overpriced?
There's another gas station down the road.
Four hundred and ten kilometers that Way,
you can't miss it.
So, pal, What you're doing here is extortion.
Extortion?
We don't like that Word around here.
What We do is affiliated marketing.

Our rule is...
...before you buy gas,
We have a little dance show...
...that you go in there and Watch,

The show is 1,200, gas is 300.
I'd say 300 a tank is reasonable. Wouldn't you?
OK. Fine.
One thousand five hundred yuan, then.
But I don't need t0 see the show.
No show, no gas.
Otherwise I'd just be..
...ripping people off.
You get in there and have your fun.
You'll be smiling when you come out.
Right?
Just go.
Don't be surprised!
Ok.
I'll go in.

I'm sorry.
You don't need to do anything.

No, nothing.
Nothing?
Then why did you run into him?
His leg was broken,
blood flowed...
Ay.
Why did you do that?
I didn't do it on purpose.
He didn't do it on purpose.
And when you hit him,
Why didn't you take him to a hospital?
I thought...
...I thought you were dead.
Is that man dead?
No?
Why did you pour gasoline on that man?
You're a very bad man.
Do you realize that What you've done is serious?
Do you realize how it impacts society?
OK.
Get the tube from the ear.

The biggest difference between a man and an animal,
is We learned how to use fire.
Tomorrow I could make the headline.
I was looking at that bird.
Why does it fly that high,
risking its life for...
...a mouthful of food?
I'm like that bird.
Those years in n0-man's land...
...Were Wasted ones.
Nobody treats me like...
...I'm a human being, not even myself.
That truck driver who saved me,
looked at me on the way,
starring,
said nothing at all.
I Was then thinking,
I'm gonna do something and make people be proud.
It's all over.
So, in the future,
are you leaving again?
No,
I'm tired.
I just Want to stay here.
To find,
