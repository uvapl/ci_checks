Long be unbroken.
- I worked overtime again
barely made it home to make
dinner for my beloved siblings.
No he offered me the promotion!
Basically It was implied..
Come on! Switch weapons!
You'll never win
with that BB gun!
You'll never get laid
with that haircut.
- Dave, really?
- Really It's a shitty haircut..
We have the same haircut.
You guys should try a real game.
Use some imagination.
- Save some electricity-.
I have a good beginner dungeon.
Yeah good luck with that nerd queen!
Watch those corners!
Oh God! No!
Shit!
Can you at least
quiet down a little
Switch around!
Switch around!
Shit! Yes...
and wave it like a flag...
Oh shit oh shit
That was a saving throw.
I rolled to see if you'd survive
a blackout spell.
.You didn't See Isn't that fun
What the hell's wrong with you
Dinner's ready so game's over
Damn right it's over.
I busted my ass on
that, you punk!
Smells like your ass too!
Jesus Dave! My mom's making vegan
crap for dinner I wanted meat!
I'm not making
anything else!
The die never lie.
I'd play your Dragons or
whatever if you asked me to.
That would be hilarious.
You're serious -
Why not You make it sound like...
I don't know I'm just saying
that I'd play if you asked.
When, exactly?
Can you hang on a second?
It's a shower night tonight
so lights out at 9:30.
Wouldn't kill you to
wash a dish either.
Hey Nothing really
It's just the usual.
My brother is a snarling ball
of anger and my sister is...
herself.
- Good times-.
"Dishes".
You really need to prioritize.
She just wants
to play with you.
By unplugging the TV
Embarrassing me
in front of my friends
Dave, you're on
that thing all the time.
Barbara is reaching out
and that's good.
No, it's weird and stupid!
- Why do you care...
- Not so loud or she'll hear us talking.
...<i>it
popped up again!</i>
<i>On third, Hayes has room.
Hayes makes the catch!</i>
Thurisaz.
The Thorn. The Hammer.
Take the force of my enemy
and send it back to him
a thousand thousand times.
Time to work.

Hi.
Are you playing a game
I don't think so.
Oh.
If you were, I would...
join you or I don't know...
I'm Sophia.
We just moved here
from Leeds, England.
No one here knows
Leeds. Only London.
- It's stinky-.
- What's it for
- Pray you never find out.
What's with the ears
Tribute to my spirit guide.
Oh! That's interesting.
I, uh...
Nice meeting you.
You have a pretty name.
- And I like the way you talk
- Thank you.
What's your...
Okay...
thanks.
I understand
what "these times" require sir
We're allowed three
personal days,
and I know that Mr Guggenheim
considers personal attendance.
No my sister she's just
a kid she can't help she's
She can't help with anything.
Um I'm not a special case I'm
just asking for common courtesy!
No obviously I want to
keep my job. I'm just...
Okay.
Okay, thank you so
much, thank you.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Can I look too?
Thanks!
We're at the same bus
stop Hi again
Wow, that looks cool!
Yeah that's it
Dark Omens are totally "cool".
What does that mean?
It means my life
is about to get complicated.
Again.
Can I sit next to you
Why?
You're the only kid I know
in like all of America
- Hi-.
Are you going to Sarah's
birthday party this weekend
Nine...
Ten...
Eleven...
Twelve...
Thirteen...
Fourteen...
Thirty-four...
Thirty-five...
Thirty-six...
Thirty-seven...
Thirty-eight...
Damn it!
- Excuse me.
- You're excused.
You make a better
door than window.
My table.
You owe me a toll.
Give it.
That's all I got.
Keep the change.
You're dead!
Barbara Thorson!
Barbara Thorson!
Mrs Mollé's office now
Please!
Have fun at the shrink psycho
She is so weird.
You might not believe this but you
know more about Birch than I do.
I'm new here, so
you're the expert.
I was hoping you can tell me a
little bit about what you like here,
what you don't.
I've already heard to stay away
from the beef teriyaki.
I really like your pocketbook.
It's nice.
I don't know what
Coveleski means.
Cov Coveleski...
What does it mean
Strike one.
What?
Barbara you're not being
tested We're just talking..
For the record I'm not being difficult
because I think your profession is B S..
I'm busy so I don't have time to
be delicate with your feelings.
So you don't even want to know
why you're here?
Because people fear
what they don't understand.
I'm good with that
so we're done here.
And next time
use a sky writer to call me
to the shrink's office.
- Less embarrassing
- No, I told them...
Yeah.
Wow...
Think it's funny
to spit on people
Not "ha-ha" funny,
but existentially yes
You're a disgusting little
bitch.
Open your pocketbook.
What I find I keep
If you don't walk away,
right now
I will do things to you
that will make God cry.
Taylor!
What's going on
My office.
Now.
A week's suspension.
Let's go.
<i>You're
pretty brave</i>
for someone who looks
like they live in a magazine.
I saw Taylor grab you
and got the principal.
You stood up to her.
Think you didn't
You think I did
I did.
She's gonna kill me.
No.
Taylor's a bully.
All bullies are the same:
Soon as you stand up to them,
they crumble.
Just like giants.
Giants
Like in your books
- Dragons and stuff?
- You like that
It's weird
I don't know.
Yeah A little..
What's so cool about giants
- This is my sanctuary-.
A holy place.
You want to know about giants
you learn here.
It's been said
that all giants are
descended from Ur,
the first giant
who was the misbegotten son
of the Earth and Sky.
Twenty miles tall...
What?
Misbegotten means the
Earth and the Sky did <i>it</i>
but they weren't married
Yeah.
My older brother
was misbegotten.
Okay.
So Ur is twenty miles tall
but he's alone.
He's the only one.
He's so lonely that
in his anguish
he tears himself apart.
<i>Giving birth</i>
<i>to giants.</i>
<i>The first dark kings
of the Earth.</i>
<i>At least that's what
they liked to think.</i>
<i>Giants are vermin,</i>
<i>like rats or pigeons.</i>
<i>But huge, of course.</i>
<i>They can hit thirty feet
and come in all flavors.</i>
<i>Frost Giants have
hair of living ice,</i>
<i>and use human kidney</i>
<i>as a garnish when
they eat reindeer.</i>
<i>Swamp Giants will clear out
a whole village of people,</i>
<i>just to replace them
with dolls made of vines.</i>
<i>Mountain Giants bathe in
the blood of children,</i>
<i>and have a penchant
for singing shepherd songs.</i>
<i>Oh and these creeps,
they're Harbingers.</i>
<i>They just like to watch.
Totally sketchy.</i>
<i>You see a Harbinger,
a Giant is around.</i>
<i>Even worse,
though, Titans.</i>
<i>These are the big guys.</i>
<i>Like Greek myth stuff.</i>
<i>Hearts of blackest opal.</i>
<i>A laugh boils your
blood in your body.</i>
<i>Eyes that make
the sun go out.</i>
Can you imagine that
Something so horrible
the sun won't shine on it.
Don't be scared.
No one's seen a Titan since
the dawn of recorded history.
Good.
The real problem
is regular giants.
Total dicks.
This was a bad year for giants.
People always write them off as
tornadoes and earthquakes and crap,
but if you open your eyes you see
the omens and know the truth.
Ever lose a dog?
Yeah it got hit by a car.
Probably not.
Probably hors d'oeuvres
for a giant.
- No my dad backed over it
- Oh.
Lucky.
So what if you do see the omens
and one really comes?
That's where I come in.
I find giants.
I hunt giants.
I kill giants.
With this.
Inside this modest sheath
slumbers the finest war hammer
ever made.
The thunder-maker.
Light bringer.
Forged from a fragment of bone
from the jaw of Ur himself...
One perfect strike
will drop even the
tallest of giants.
Can I see it
This is a sacred vessel.
It can only be opened
when duty calls.
"Coveleski".
Weapons of great renown
have to have a name.
Coveleski was a baseball player.
A rookie for the Philadelphia
Phillies 100 years ago.
Are you okay?
What's the matter? Barbara?
Sorry... I have to go.
Barbara! Hey!
You don't want to get
too close to me.
People close to me get hurt.
I'm over here!
No This way you big idiot
Damn it...
<i>Barbara!</i>
<i>Barbara!</i>
<i>Barbara!</i>
<i>Barbara!</i>
<i>Barbara!</i>
<i>I made a friend.</i>
Her name is Sophia.
She wears nice clothes but
she's English so
that's to be expected.
So, see? I'm normal.
Can I go now?
There's serious stuff going down
I have to deal with.
Do you have many friends
Right.
Why not, Barbara?
Because most kids my age
care more about who's on TV
or if they have cool sneakers
than talking to me.
And I'm a little mean
to people who are dumb.
And most people are dumb.
Is your sister Karen dumb
Family is "strike
two" territory.
Barbara...
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I push
too hard too soon,
but it's because I want
to get to know you a bit more.
Okay?
I'll go first.
I wasn't always a psychologist...
That would be impossible
unless you were cloned from one.
- I assume you were a baby.
- Yes, I was a baby.
Then a child
then a young woman,
then a manager of a
small hedge fund.
The good kind
or did you rip off old ladies
I wasn't sure.
So I decided
I wanted to try something else.
To try to make a
difference doing this.
Is that corny?
The word "corny" is corny.
Wanting to make a difference is
nice but you think too small
Call me when you've saved a
town, and we can compare notes.
Have you saved a town?
I protect this dump like once a month
but don't go around bragging about it.
What do you protect us from?
If you have to ask, then you
clearly haven't read my file.
I have a file.
Yes but this file
doesn't tell me who you are,
how you feel.
Delicious!
Right.
Gumbs Nehring
Rugg you're in red
The rest of you are
in blue today.
You know that forest
giant I told you about
He's getting ballsy!
We have to find him.
I don't want to get
anyone into trouble.
We're already in trouble.
Hey! L'il Posh Spice!
Zip it!
Thorson, drop the book.
Huddle up!
Today we're gonna take a stab
at America's favorite pastime:
baseball.
Miss Laney Can I be excused
I might have food poisoning
or a twisted ankle.
It's just baseball, Thorson.
You just stand there...
- I'll take the F. Thanks.
- I thought you liked baseball.
You said Coveleski was a...
Harry Coveleski
That's some obscure
baseball history Thorson
Coveleski hasn't played
in like a hundred years.
Got any Phillies
fans in the family
Miss Laney
would you describe your job as
worthless or utterly pointless
Principal's office.
Now.
I cherish our times together.
You are the Dalai
Lama of principals.
Shall I make it a month
No thank you sir
Namaste.
Get out of here.
Cool.
<i>This is a
sacred vessel.</i>
<i>It can only be opened
when duty calls.</i>
No. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I wasn't really... I
wasn't really going to open it.
I'm sorry. I have
forgotten myself.
My holy quest.
Coveleski is sacred.
It won't ever happen again.
I swear. I swear. I swear.
<i>Please follow
staff instructions</i>
<i>and proceed in an
orderly fashion</i>
<i>to your assigned areas
outside of the building...</i>
Okay, please.
Move along. Lucy, Jim.
Where are you going?
There's still three periods!
Did you get the note?
There are times
you have to ask yourself,
"Do I want
to live my life as a coward
or a warrior"
Decide.
Where are we going?
I've been working on a plan
to lead it away from the town
to the old train graveyard.
Stay close.
Stay calm.
It won't hurt you
while I'm here.
Barbara,
how long is this gonna take?
Be quiet. It's up ahead.
- We'll get in trouble.
- We're gonna save this town.
It should have taken
the second bait.
Something must've
caught its attention.
- There is no way this wouldn't work.
- We have to go back.
We'll say we got locked out by
accident.
Hold on. You need to understand
what we're dealing with.
Giants aren't real.
Then why are you sweating?
There you have it.
Can't compete with a baby deer.
Once they find food
they don't go for the bait.
We're going to have to track it.
I want to see if it took a bite
out of this guy, though.
Might tell me what we are dealing with.
It sucked it up good.
It's pretty drained.
This is weird Barbara
I want to go home. Now.
Please!
Sophia!
Harbingers...
What good will
you be against real monsters?
Even a dim-witted forest giant
has baffled you... twice!
It will be back.
Just a child,
so weak,
so weak.
Do you have wood in your garage?
You won't get in trouble.
Don't tell anyone and I'll protect you.
Harbingers are creeps
You don't want them around you.
Are you afraid of blood?
Yes.
Don't look.
Just squeeze the ice.
I don't like this.
- I know you're into it, but...
- It's your ward of protection.
It has to be your blood.
I do it all the time
without any ice. Come on.
Sophia
I know I'm an awkward freak.
I know no one likes me.
I know that everything
I do looks crazy.
But this will protect you
when I'm not around.
And I'd feel better
knowing that you're safe.
Trust me.
Look into my eyes and say this:
Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer.
Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer.
Take the force of my enemy
and send it back to him
a thousand thousand times.
Take the force of my enemy and send it
back to him a thousand thousand times.
Are you gonna do it?
I did it when you
looked in my eyes.
Thank you.
<i>There's a high drive,
left field, well hit!</i>
<i>Back there, it
is... a home run!</i>
<i>It's a long fly ball...</i>
Barbara!
Barbara?
Barbara?
I can hear your tapes
in the whole house.
Well, I have to be
up early tomorrow.
I sure do!
High finance is a man's world
but I don't let anything get me
down because I have gumption!
I chew
gumption after every meal.'
Stinky.' Beloved cubicle-mate.
Have I told you if you only
smelled like butt dipped in tuna
that would be an improvement?
I think Stinky needs
to get to bed.
Luckily I Glorious Guggenheim
will save you from a life of drudgery
and olfactory assault with...
a promotion!
Oh, thank you so much,
Mr Guggenheim!
It's very nice of you.
But I don't need a
pity promotion.
I'm gonna figure this out.
That's the smartest thing
you've ever said, big Karen.
Thank you, little Karen.
Perhaps I should talk
to my little sister more too.
I'm trying, Barbara.
I wanna
try something new.
A game.
People play too many games.
Let's just keep it honest.
Okay.
Honestly?
I put my neck on the line
to keep you out of suspension
after your little
stunt in gym class.
It's a word game.
I say a word
and you say a word back, okay?
Like game...
No!
I... lose.
Diamond.
Fake.
Mrs. Mollé,
- things are happening. I have to go...
- Baseball.
Baseball.
Baseball.
Barbara...
You're holding my hand.
It's okay.
I'm your friend.
Someone you can talk to
if you're having problems.
- I have to go to the bathroom...
- Like if you're angry
if you're afraid...
- Please let me go.
- What's making you sad...
- Please let me go.
- Like what's going on at home.
With Karen and Dave...
<i>Kinarus,
kinarus</i>
<i>Coveleski...</i>
Weapons of great renown
have to have a name.
<i>Barbara...</i>
<i>A game.</i>
I say a word
and you say a word back.
<i>Baseball.</i>
<i>Harry Coveleski...</i>
<i>Coveleski was
a baseball player,</i>
<i>a rookie</i>
<i>for the Philadelphia
Phillies.</i>
That's some obscure
baseball history, Thorson.
<i>Got any Phillies

Sophia!
Nice one psycho
- I'm sorry! I didn't...
- She's a total psycho.
Sophia!
Please...
Sorry dinner's late.
Sorry dinner's gonna suck.
Call the coast guard.
The red tide's in.
I had to kiss ass and stay late
because my day got derailed
by a phone call.
We all had issues today.
- I'm trying to move forward.
- You hit a goddamn teacher!
I would never hit a teacher.
They don't get paid enough
for that abuse.
- She's a psychologist.
- Are you freaking mental?
Ouch!
Son of a bitch!
I can't do this.
How can I do this by myself?
You two won't grow
up and help me.
I can't deal with
you going crazy.'
When you act out, they call me at work
and then I have to deal with your shit.
It's a problem for me because I'm
trying my best to hold it all together.
Barbara This is
not fair, Barbara!
Hey, this is not fair!
- You're not running away!
- Yes, I am!
No, you're not.'
Why are you fighting me?
I'm trying to help you.
So is the shrink!
If you want to fight somebody,
stand up to that bully at school!
Says the whiney doormat
who can't talk to her own boss!
You have <i>no</i> idea
what I've given up for you.
Neither do you!
She's crazy,
but she knows how to punch.
It... was an accident.
It did not look
like an accident.
She's my friend.
Shouldn't be.
<i>People will
talk about you too.</i>
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>crazy people can't
have friends.</i>
<i>It's part of
their sickness.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>
<i>You're a nice kid.</i>
<i>You want to help her, like
a dog with a broken leg.</i>
<i>The only way to
help a crazy person</i>
<i>You've seen her
crazy stuff, right?</i>
<i>I bet she showed
you her traps</i>
<i>and weird shit!</i>
<i>I like you.</i>
<i>You're pretty.</i>
<i>You could be cool.
I'll make you a deal.</i>
<i>Tell me some of the
crazy stuff...</i>
and I'll tell you a secret
about your friend.
Close the door, please.
Tell me about giants.
How come I'm not expelled?
I know you called Karen.
People in New Jersey
know you called Karen.
Why didn't you tell
the principal?
Everyone gets one.
I can excuse one.
Do I need to expand?
Why do giants have to die?
Looking at them,
they look pretty silly to me.
If I remember Mickey Mouse
beat giants twice
with no problem.
Those are so stupid!
God!
A giant comes to a place...
and destroys everything
in its path.
Worse than that.
It's not like a dumb cartoon
or something.
A giant...
What?
A giant...
is hate.
Smashing stuff isn't enough.
A giant takes.
It takes everything from you.
And when it's done...
It's like anything
that made your life good
was never even there.
It's horrible.
Barbara...
are you afraid of giants?
No.
I'm not afraid of them.
Because I have Coveleski.
With this I can stop it.
If I'm strong enough.
If I stay focused.
If I'm worthy...
I can stop death itself.
Coveleski sounds very special.
May I see it?
After school!
No!
- I'll show you then.
- Now is perfect.
What's going to happen?
Barbara, please stay.'
Damn it.
Look at all this crap!
I told you.
Giant traps. What a freak!
Hilarious Can we
burn this shit?
Ugh!
Ugh.
Stop it, Taylor!
Stop it
or I'm going to kill you.
She told us about your
stupid junk here.
She knows
you're a messed up psycho.
You gonna kill her too?
She'll get hers.
You said you wouldn't touch it.
Worry about yourself.
Coveleski is about to speak.
Come on. She's nothing.
What happened to it?
I'm sorry!
Fight back!
Sorry!
Barbara!
Sophia...
Why did you bring me upstairs?
We never go upstairs!
Come here!
Slowly.
Please!
Don't let it see you.
Sophia!
- Mrs. Mollé!
- Barbara?
I'm sorry.
It's the 21st century.
Everyone knows where everyone lives.
What happened to you?
Something's wrong with me.
No, honey.
There's nothing wrong with you.
There she is!
We're so happy Mommy's
home, aren't we?
- Just one second.
- We've been crying for an hour.
Oh my gosh.
Momma's here, Momma's here...
Momma's here. It's okay.
Oh, you picked up a stray?
This is
my friend Barbara
Hey.
Barbara, this is my husband
and here is
the reason why I've been tired
all the time.
Her name is Jacqueline also known
as Mrs Fussy Colicky Pants.
Yeah.
She's doing better.
She's going to die.
- What did she say?
- No, it's fine.
Everyone's going to die.
Do you want to come inside?
Wait, Barbara.
Barbara, come inside!
Barbara!
Where are you?
Come fight me!
Let me call you right back.
Karen?
<i>It's just
not possible</i>
'cause I put her on the
bus myself every day.
Not the last
few days, apparently.
I have to leave before the bus,
but I pack her goddamn book bag
and make breakfast.
I've left messages, Ms. Thorson.
A lot of the time I just leave
out cereal and milk. Or...
I don't...
I think yesterday Dave
ate left over chicken surprise.
It's all falling apart.
I'm falling apart.
You've done the best you can.
Coveleski.
<i>In 1908,</i>
<i>Harry Coveleski, a left-handed rookie
from the coal mines of Pennsylvania</i>
<i>was thrust into the
spotlight when...</i>
<i>The pitcher was called
to the mound by the Phillies</i>
<i>to do battle against the
unstoppable New York Giants.</i>
<i>At only twenty-one,</i>
<i>Coveleski stunned the nation.
He decimated the Giants' lineup</i>
<i>three times in five days...</i> Mom,
let me do this part.'
<i>Coveleski's story captured the
hearts of fans across the nation,</i>
<i>earning him the nickname
The Giant Killer.</i>
The Giant Killer.
<i>See, you
never give up, Barbara.</i>
<i>Oh I wish I could have
seen those games.</i>
<i>But then you'd
be old.</i>
Manny said I could
use the table.
Why weren't you at school?
Do you know
what a meme of malcontent is?
It's when someone can think a
name and send a person to hell,
where their skin is cooked off
and made into pies for demons.
I'm meme-ing you right now.
I brought Mrs. Mollé
to your house.
- You're scaring us, Barbara...
- I'm scaring you?
When bloody parts of people
fall out of the sky
and all you can see is red
then you'll be scared.
And it'll be your fault.
You betrayed me!
Coveleski is broken!
Because of you and your
bony-assed friend Taylor!
Without it I'm nothing.
- I won't be able to stop the giant...
- There is no giant! Just stop!
I trusted you!
Then why didn't you
tell me about...
Stupid!
Pathetic.
Weaker than before,
playing your game
as the giant draws near.
We waste our time.
We have no spirit
for this. Lost.
Confused.
Friendless.
When the giant finds you,
you will find yourself alone
and quivering.
Prove yourself.
Prove yourself. Now!
It's waiting at the
edge of the forest.
What did you do?
I saved you and every other
idiot in this stupid town.
But tell me again I'm crazy.
<i>I've kept
my solemn oath.</i>
<i>I've kept the darkness</i>
<i>at bay.</i>
<i>I have shown my worth.</i>
<i>Please return
Coveleski to me.</i>
<i>On Doppler radar,</i>
<i>we see a rapidly developing front
along the Jersey coastline.</i>
<i>Very rare for this time of year
and surprisingly powerful.</i>
Barbara?
<i>Three hours ago,
we forecasted a sunny weekend, and now...</i>
Barbara?
<i>Practically out
of nowhere.</i>
<i>Some counties in Southern New York
are issuing tornado warnings.</i>
<i>I highly doubt we're
gonna see that...</i>
<i>- Hello?
- Karen? Hi.</i>
<i>Hi, it's Mrs. Mollé.
Is Barbara with you?</i>
<i>No, she didn't
go to school?</i>
<i>She came to school, yes.
But... there was an incident with Taylor.</i>
<i>What, another fight?</i>
<i>No, something else.</i>
<i>Barbara went after Taylor.
It was very upsetting.</i>
<i>The details don't
matter now.</i>
<i>I just want to make sure
that Barbara's okay.</i>
<i>Elder spirits,
I have killed the giant</i>
<i>and set my house
in order.</i>
Please. Give it back.
You ok?
- Taylor?
- I'm gonna kill that bitch.'
Taylor! Get
back here, now.
<i>Attention, students...</i>
Stop!
Barbara!
<i>Gather your things
and report to...</i>
Barbara!
Go home.
Go hug your family...
I thought it was over,
but something's wrong.
I thought I could sacrifice
Taylor, but they need more.
I didn't want to kill anything.
That's black magic.
- This stuff is already dead.
- Barbara...
Barbara, I went to your house.
Go home, please.
- Let me work!
- Your work isn't real!
Let's get in the car.
I'll take you home.
You're not listening to me!
Another giant is coming.
If I don't fix Coveleski,
I can't kill it!
Barbara.
Your mother... wants to see you.
Why are you acting weird?
I don't...
I don't have...
- The giant...
- No! No!
Okay?
Your mother is sick.
Do you understand?
That's reality, Barbara.
- And you have to face it.
- No!
Barbara!
Stop it!
I said stop!
Shut up! She's not
even your friend!
That freak crossed the line!
She's not a freak.
Her mom is sick, okay?
Really sick.'
I am her friend!
I don't give a shit.
You can all die together.
Ahh!
I hate you!
I hate you!
Barbara!
What happened?
I tried to stop her but...
It's okay!
Come on, we have to get inside.
My leg...
What's happening?
It's time.
- Take cover.
- We have to get inside.'
Sophia Please...
If you can't run, hide.
Now.
Barbara!
Oh no... It's a titan.
You can't have her!
You can't have her, you hear me?
You will not hurt my mother!
I beat you.
I beat you!
My mom is going to live
because I beat you.
She is going to live!
Little warrior...
you fought with honor.
But I did not come for her.
I came for you.
I came... for you.
But I beat you.
I beat you.
I know child
I know.
I can't save her?
So finish it.
<i>All things that
live in this world</i>
<i>die.</i>
<i>This is why you must find joy
in the living,</i>
<i>while the time is yours.</i>
<i>And not fear the end.</i>
<i>To deny this</i>
<i>is to deny life.</i>
<i>But...</i>
<i>to embrace it.</i>
<i>Can you embrace it?</i>
Barbara!
<i>You are stronger
than you think.</i>
<i>Climatologists are
dumbfounded by the storm</i>
<i>that ripped through
Long Island.</i>
<i>There have been no significant
tornadoes in this area for decades.</i>
<i>The conditions to generate such a
storm are considered extremely rare.</i>
<i>There were no warning signs and
nothing officials could do.</i>
<i>Miraculously, despite
the devastation,</i>
<i>there were only minor
injuries and no casualties.</i>
Mom?
I'm scared to open my eyes.
Am I dreaming?
No, Mom.
No.
There was a big storm.
I heard it.
Was it scary?
No.
I'm not scared of storms.
Neither am I.
They can be...
They can be sort of beautiful.
And then afterwards,
it's so quiet.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Shh.
I'm sorry I was
scared to see you.
Hush...
Hush, now.
Let's get right to it!
Who wants to tell me
something they did this summer?
All right, I'll pick
a brave volunteer.
Barbara Thorson?
My break wasn't
very interesting.
I needed a lot of rest, so...
I ate, slept, played.
Hung out with my mom.
And killed a Titan
with her bare hands!
Technically
that was before the holidays.
And she used a hammer.
But she did that too.
Um, right.
Okay... Anybody else?
Barbara.
Is it time?
Karen's on her way.
The doctor says it's soon.
Are you afraid?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Thank you.
I'm all right.
We're all going to be all right.
We're stronger than we think.
