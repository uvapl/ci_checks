Come on.
- Mr Shepherd.
- yes.
- When are we to be paid?
- In due course.
The bills are outstanding!
I'm aware they're outstanding.
Mr Shepherd, these bills go back
for months and months.
Look! February, March, April...
Gentlemen, the war is over.
Bonaparte?
Bonaparte has abdicated.
He is confined
to the island of Elba.
We're going home.
Gentlemen, the Admiral.
The Admiral.
I will not have
a sailor in my house.
I strongly object to the Navy.
It brings persons of obscure
birth into undue distinction.
And it cuts up a man's
youth and vigour most horribly.
One day last spring, in town,
I was in company
with a certain Admiral Baldwin,
the most deplorable-looking
person you can imagine.
His face like mahogany,
all lines and wrinkles,
nine grey hairs and only
a dab of powder on top.
"In heaven's name," said I
to Sir Basil, who was near,
"Who is that old fellow?"
"Old fellow?!" cried Sir Basil,
"Why, that is Admiral Baldwin,
who is forty and no more. "
And they're all the same.
Have mercy on the men,
Sir Walter.
We were not all born
to be handsome.
you will not have a naval man
as a tenant?
No, I will not, Shepherd. No.
Then there is
but one course open to you.
- you must retrench.
- Retrench?
Retrench!
How may I retrench?
A baronet must be seen
to live like a baronet.
Sir Walter, I have been
your neighbour for many years
and am as solicitous for your
family as anybody could be.
But your debts
are extreme.
you must retrench.
I have therefore
taken the liberty
of drawing up some plans
of economy for your family.
I have, er...
made exact calculations
and I have consulted Anne
on some points of detail.
Anne, why?
What?
Journeys, servants...!
I'd as soon
quit Kellynch Hall at once
than remain on it
on such disgraceful terms!
Bath is but 50 mile
from Kellynch.
And, if I may say,
an altogether safer location
for a gentleman
in your predicament.
In Bath you may be important
at comparatively little expense.
Sorbet in September...
how delightful!
Enjoy it,
there'll be no more ice
until the winter.
Bath is most congenial.
The Assembly Rooms are splendid
and have concerts every week.
I am for...
for Bath.
I have always said,
Bath is incomparable.
Who is this Admiral Croft?
I met with him at
the quarter sessions in Taunton.
He's a native of Somersetshire
who acquired a fortune in the
war and wishes to return here.
But who is he?
He is rear admiral of the white.
He was in the Trafalgar action
and has been
in the East Indies since.
Stationed there,
I believe, several years.
Then, his face has the colour
and texture of this macaroon.
The Admiral is weather-beaten,
but not much.
He is a married man,
but without children.
A house is never
taken care of without a lady.
And a lady with no children
is the best preserver
of furniture in the world.
Moreover, Mrs Croft is herself
not unconnected in this country.
Oh? With whom is she connected?
She's the sister of a gentleman
who lived here.
What was his name? Monkton?
Brother of Mrs Croft.
Bless me, what was his name?
Anne, you'll recall?.
It was Wentworth.
Wentworth.
- Wentworth?
- That's right! Wentworth.
The curate of Monkford.
you'll remember him, I'm sure.
Oh, Wentworth the curate.
you misled me, Shepherd,
by the term gentleman.
Wentworth the curate is nobody,
quite unconnected! Nothing to do
with the Strafford family!
Said I something amiss?
you remember, Father...
the curate's brother.
- The sailor!
- Let us not pursue it.
please excuse me. The fire...
I became over-heated,
that's all.
I am satisfied. I empower you
to proceed with the treaty.
They may take possession
at Michaelmas.
And Shepherd, with your consent,
I wish to engage dear Mrs Clay
to reside with us in Bath.
She will be a companion
for Elizabeth.
I can think of no higher
privilege for my daughter, sir,
than to accompany
Miss Elliot in society.
What about Anne? Is Anne
not companion enough for you?
Oh, Anne won't be coming,
Lady Russell.
I had a letter this morning from
sister Mary who's indisposed
and requires Anne's company
in Uppercross...
until her health improves.
And since no one
will want you in Bath,
I'm sure you'd better stay here.
Information and entertainment
awaits you on these shelves,
Admiral.
I confess, I have not fully
mastered it myself.
Only the most
comfortable room, Sir Walter.
And thus we proceed
to the dining room, Admiral.
The second best silver will
be at your disposal, Mrs Croft.
Instruct the servants to be
civil to Admiral Croft, Anne.
I declare, he's the best-looking
sailor I ever met.
Indeed, if my own man
might be allowed
the arranging of his hair,
I should not be ashamed
of being seen with him anywhere.
.. and then we're going
to buy you a hat.
Then we are going to buy
boxes and boxes of marzipan.
I haven't spoken
to the gardeners.
So here is the list of plants
for Lady Russell.
And these books of music
must be sent on to Bath.
And you'd better catalogue
all the pictures
and clear your rubbish
out of the store room.
And someone ought to visit
every house in the parish
as a take leave.
It's the Elliot way.
If only I'd had a son.
All this might one day
have been his.
Be what use you can
to your sister Mary.
yes, Father.
I really must fetch you
up to Bath after Christmas.
Walk on.
For eight years
you've been too little
from home, too little seen.
And your spirits
have never been high since...
your disappointment.
A larger society
would improve them.
But I so dislike Bath.
Because you associate it with
the passing of your dear mother.
When my mother was alive,
Lady Russell,
there was moderation
and economy in our home.
And no need of moving out.
Hmm.
Do you travel directly
to Uppercross?
yes.
yes, I prefer to be gone
when his sis...
When Admiral
and Mrs Croft arrive.
I hope that they are as little
familiar with the business
as my own people seem to be.
I have no desire to meet the new
tenants of Kellynch Hall.
I feel this break-up
of your family exceedingly.
Indeed, it angers me.
I have done my best to...
stand in your mother's place
and offer the advice
she would have given.
And now...
Lady Russell,
I have never said this...
Do not talk of it.
you shall not talk of it.
I do not blame you.
Nor do I blame myself
for having been guided by you.
But I am now persuaded
that in spite
of the disapproval at home
and the anxiety
attending his prospects
that I...
I should have been happier,
had I...
you were nineteen, Anne.
Nineteen - to involve yourself
with a man who had nothing
but himself to recommend him.
The spirit of brilliance,
to be sure,
but no fortune, no connections.
It was entirely prudent of you
to reject him.
Now, here are the new poems
I was telling you of.
Altogether, I care little
for these romantics, do you?
Whoa!
So... you've come at last!
I began to think
I should never see you.
I am so ill,
I can hardly speak.
I haven't seen a creature
the whole morning.
Suppose I were to be seized
in some dreadful way,
and not able to ring the bell?.
Lady Russell, I notice,
would not come in person.
She's not been in this house
three times this summer.
Lady Russell cordially asked
to be remembered to yourself
and Charles.
Charles has been out shooting
since 7 o'clock.
He said he wouldn't stay long,
but he hasn't come back.
I do believe,
if Charles saw me dying,
he wouldn't believe there was
anything the matter with me.
Well, I always cure you
when I come to Uppercross.
So, how is everyone
at the great house?
I couldn't say. Not one of them
has been near me.
It doesn't happen
to suit the Miss Musgroves
to visit the sick.
perhaps you will see them
before the morning is gone.
I do not want them.
My sisters-in-law
talk and laugh too much
for one in my condition.
And Henrietta goes on and on
about that wretched curate
from Winthrop.
Oh, Anne.
Why could you not have come
earlier?
Well, it is so unkind.
I really have had so much to do.
What can you possibly have had?
A great many things, in fact.
Oh.
Well...
Dear me...
you haven't asked me about our
dinner at the pooles' yesterday.
I thought you must have
given up the engagement.
Oh! No, I...
I was very well... yesterday...
It's... It's just today.
I...
I feel like death.
Had you a pleasant party?
Nothing remarkable.
One always knows beforehand,
what the dinner will be
and who will be there.
And it is so uncomfortable, not
having a carriage of one's own.
Charles' parents took me.
It was so crowded.
They take up so much room.
I was crushed into the back seat
with Henrietta and Louisa.
I think it most likely
that my illness today
may be owing to it.
you know, Anne...
I'm feeling somewhat improved.
Assuming I do not relapse,
shall we walk after luncheon
to the great house?
Oh, I'd like that.
Theyought to have called
on you first.
Theyought to know what is due
to you as my sister.
But I wouldn't dream
of standing on ceremony
with people I know so well
as the Musgroves.
So, Sir Walter and your sister
are gone.
What part of Bath
will they settle in?
Must that thing go
exactly there, Henrietta?
Isn't it splendid, Mama?
It will sound well
with the pianoforte,
don't you think, Anne?
What was wrong
with my old spinet,
that it must make way
for this great noisy article?
Anne, will you play
when we give a dance?
you play better than either of
us, and we are wild for dancing.
Oh, yes, please, Miss Anne.
Oh, Lord bless me, how those
fingers of hers can fly about!
I will play too, if you wish.
I am as accomplished as Anne.
Why... thank you, Mary.
B... But we enjoy
to watch you dancing, Mary.
you're so light on your feet.
And, as you know,
Anne does not care to dance.
No.
- I sent them round the back.
- Ah, we'll do it.
There, now!
Ah, Miss Anne.
What a great delight.
Mr Musgrove.
The delight is all mine
to return once more
to Uppercross.
you're most welcome here.
Thank you. you look well,
Charles. Very well.
I got a pheasant
and Father hit a squirrel
- but the dog couldn't find.
- Oh, no.
I feel pretty well, Anne.
Thank you. yes.
you were missed at luncheon,
Charles.
y... your father is in good
health, I trust, Miss Anne?
They've gone to Bath, papa.
Do you not remember me saying?
Oh, yes. Bath.
I hope we'll be
in Bath this winter.
perhaps we may.
But we must be
in a good situation.
Somewhere
near the circus, papa.
Well, it's a big place, Bath.
Aye, it's a great big place.
So I believe.
Upon my word,
I shall be well off,
when you are all gone away
to be happy at Bath.
Anne, come and sit by the fire.
My dear, I never interfere in
my daughter-in-law's concerns.
But I have to tell you,
I have no very good opinion of
the way Mary curbs her children.
Oh, they are fine, healthy boys.
But, Lord bless me,
how troublesome they can be!
Mrs Musgrove's forever
advising me on the care
of little Charles and Walter.
y et she feeds them sweet things
and they come home sick.
Moreover, how can I
keep them in order
when their father
spoils them so much?
I could manage the boys, were it
not for Mary's interference.
I wish you could persuade her
not to always fancy herself ill.
It is a very bad thing,
to be visited by children
whom one can only keep
in tolerable order
by more cake than is good
for them.
Could you, whilst you are here,
give Mary a hint
not to be so very tenacious
about taking precedence
over Mama.
Nobody doubts her right
to take precedence over Mama,
it's not becoming of her
always to insist on it.
Mama doesn't care
about etiquette,
it's the cake she cares about.
Most people are apt to forget
whose daughter I am.
When you have a moment,
speak to Charles,
and persuade him
that I am very, very ill.
Oh, Anne.
When will the Admiral
take possession?
At Michaelmas.
Let us hope they are not tardy
about paying their respects.
My husband is riding to hounds
this morning, Admiral,
or he should have been here.
Naturally, I am disappointed,
Mrs Musgrove.
So too will he be.
He has been curious to meet
his father-in-law's tenant.
- Back here!
- I want to see the Admiral.
No, no. Let them be.
So, come up on my knee.
There you go.
The Admiral loves children.
you want to sail the sea?
First, you must learn how to
go up and down with the swell.
Like this.
Oh, I can hear
your timbers creaking.
It was you
and not your sister, I find,
whom my brother was acquainted
with in this country.
perhaps you have not heard.
He is married.
Oh...
That is... That is excellent
news, Mrs Croft.
I wish him every happiness.
With your permission, I shall
tell him so in my next letter.
Oh, please do.
And he has a new curacy too...
at last.
They are settled in a parish
in Shropshire.
Have you seen a boat
made out of paper?
- No.
- Come, I'll show you.
Here, over by the desk.
There we go.
Watch very closely.
I was just telling your sister
about my brother Edward's
good fortune in Shropshire.
He's a curate.
A curate.
How interesting.
Oh, we are expecting soon,
another brother of my wife's.
A seafaring brother
whom you won't have met.
But we do know him.
Do we not, Anne?
He visited when I was a girl
and called at Kellynch Hall
once or twice.
yes.
I did not know you were
acquainted with Frederick also.
yes.
I... I believe you to have been
in the Indies at that time.
There!
Hip-hip, hurrah!
Hip-hip, hurrah!
Hip-hip, hurrah!
- Good morning, Anne.
- Oh, good morning.
papa has met Captain Wentworth.
- Indeed, has he?
- yes.
He and Mama drove over
to Kellynch and he was there!
He is just returned
to England...
or paid off...
or something, and...
Are you coming in, or isn't
my cottage grand enough for you?
Oh. I may not stay. Thank you.
I'm here solely to invite you
to the great house this evening,
to meet Captain
Frederick Wentworth.
By all accounts, a most charming
and agreeable gentleman.
And he is to call on us tonight.
We shall be present, Henrietta.
Have no fear.
Mama.
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
Anne! Anne!
Anne! Down, quickly!
I've reset the collar bone.
And the spine?
Time will tell.
- Should I take him to bed?
- No.
Leave him where he is.
And what may I give him?
Water.
What happened?
He fell from a tree.
Oh, Charles.
How can you contemplate
such a thing?
How can you abandon
your son and heir for a dinner?
The child is doing well.
The apothecary is content,
what more can a father do?
I need my gloves.
Nursing does not
belong to a man, Mary.
It is not his province.
I am as fond of my child
as any mother,
but I have not the nerves
for the sick room.
This is always my luck!
If anything disagreeable's going
on, men will get out of it.
Could you spend the evening
away from little Charles?
If his father can,
why shouldn't I?
Then go to the great house.
Leave the boy to my care.
Dear me...
that's a very good thought.
you don't mind?
I do wish to meet
Captain Wentworth,
and you, Anne, are by far
the properest person
to sit with the boy.
you haven't a mother's
feelings, have you?
He did enquire
after you slightly,
as might suit
a slight acquaintance.
He was very attentive
to me, however.
Charles and he are
to shoot together this morning.
- But they will not call here?
- No. On account of the child.
Oh, on account of the child.
- I've come for the dogs.
- What?
I've come for the dogs.
We're just setting off.
Captain Wentworth follows
with Henrietta and Louisa.
- Mary, may he call on you?
- Why, certainly.
Here he comes now.
The Miss Musgroves, ma'am,
and Captain Wentworth.
Morning, Mary. Morning, Anne.
Mrs Musgrove.
It's most pleasant to see you
again so soon, Captain.
How's your boy?
Much better, thank you. I...
He's taken some broth.
I believe you are acquainted
with my elder sister?
We have met once.
Captain Wentworth.
I wish young Charles a very
speedy recovery, Mrs Musgrove.
Henrietta and Louisa swear
he's quite a character.
your husband, I hear,
is a very decent shot.
I mustn't let him grab
the best position.
I see I've intruded
on your breakfast, forgive me.
Good day.
- Shall we walk with them?
- Oh, yes.
And so shall I.
Do women often
come shooting, Charles?
Not that often, Frederick, no.
Had you good hunting, Mary?
Upon my word, yes!
We bagged...
oh, ever so many birds.
But that Captain Wentworth...
he's not very gallant
towards you, Anne.
When Henrietta
asked him about you,
he said you were so altered, he
would not have known you again.
Do you suppose we live on board
without anything to eat,
nor any cooks, any servants,
nor any knife and fork to use.
We ain't savages!
Let me tell you about the Asp,
my first command.
We sailed away in the Asp
in the year 1806.
We have a navy list.
We shall look her up.
They made me send for it,
Captain, from plymouth.
you won't find it in the new
list - she's been scrapped.
I was the last man
to command her, eight years ago,
and she wasn't fit
for service then.
Nearly sank
on several occasions, the Asp.
Then I should only have been
a gallant Captain Wentworth
in a small newspaper paragraph
and you'd not have heard of me.
y et still you took her out?
Well, the Admiralty likes to
entertain itself now and then,
by sending men to sea on a ship
hardly fit to be employed.
Well said.
Lucky fellow to get her
or anything so soon!
I felt my luck, I assure you.
Well, I was well satisfied
with the position.
I was extremely keen
at the time,
the year six, to be at sea.
I was extremely keen.
Badly wanted
to be doing something.
Naturally, you did.
What should a young fellow do
ashore for half a year together?
When a man has no wife,
he wants to be afloat again.
Well, I had no wife
in the year six.
And then, Captain Wentworth,
what came next?
- The Laconia.
- Find the Laconia.
Those were great days.
Here she is! HMS Laconia,
74 gun frigate, second class.
A friend and I cruised
off the West Indies
taking enough privateers
to make it very entertaining,
and, er... make us quite rich.
Do you remember
Captain Harville, Admiral?.
- Harville?
- yes. Excellent fellow.
I wonder what's become of him?
Did not you bring Mrs Harville
and her children
round from portsmouth
to plymouth last spring?
- yes, why?
- Ah!
I'd bring anything of Harville's
from the world's end
if he asked me to.
And this from the man
famous for declaring
he will never
have a woman on his ship.
- What, never?
- Except for a ball, of course.
It's from no lack of gallantry
towards women, Mrs Musgrove.
Rather the reverse.
Accommodation onboard
is not suitable for ladies.
Frederick, I have lived on five!
But, Sophy, you were
with your husband,
and were
the only woman on board.
I hate you talking about all
women as irrational creatures.
None of us want to be
in calm waters all our lives.
When he has a wife, Sophy,
he will sing a different tune.
Then, if we have the luck
to live to another war,
we shall see him grateful to
anybody who brings him his wife.
Oh, no, no. I have done. When
married people attack me with
"you shall think differently
when you are married. "
I say, "No, I shan't. "
And they'll say again,
"Oh, yes, you shall,
and there's an end of it. "
Mrs Musgrove.
you must have been
a great traveller, ma'am.
I have crossed
the Atlantic four times
and I have been once
to the East Indies,
and to different places
around home.
Cork
and Lisbon
and Gibraltar.
But not the West Indies.
We don't call Bermuda or Bahama
the West Indies, as you know.
I don't think Mama's called
them anything in her whole life!
But, did you never suffer
any sickness, Mrs Croft?
No.
The only time that I ever
imagined myself unwell,
or had any ideas of danger,
was the winter
that I passed on my own
at Deal.
When the Admiral,
Captain Croft then,
was away on the north seas.
That, I did not like.
But as long as
we could be together,
nothing ever ailed me.
Not a thing.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
- This is your seat.
- Not at all, I...
No, never.
She has quite given up dancing.
Whoa.
Henrietta, it's Henry.
Henry!
Captain Wentworth,
this is our cousin
from Winthrop, Henry Hayter.
Sir.
£20,000.
He told me he's made
£20,000 in the war.
He'd be a capital match
for either of my sisters.
Which do you think
might marry the Captain?
Mary gives it for Henrietta,
I'm for Louisa.
Mmm.
I do not think Henrietta
has the right
to throw herself away
on Henry Hayter.
She must think of her family.
It's inconvenient of any woman
to give bad connections
to those unused to them.
Henry's a good-natured fellow,
and he will inherit very pretty
property at Winthrop.
Henrietta might do far worse.
If she has him,
and Louisa can get the Captain,
I shall be well satisfied.
What say you, Anne?
Which one is the Captain
in love with?
- Why should I shift my ground?
- There's Mama and papa.
Henry Hayter's a man
they both admire.
Do come to your senses!
Good morning.
Good morning!
Won't you come in
and sit with us a little?
Thank you, but we're to go
for a long walk.
- I am fond of walking.
- It's a very long walk.
Why's everybody always supposing
I'm not a good walker?
I should like to join you very
much. Let's fetch our wraps.
Mary, we have
our puzzle to fi...
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Louisa, Henrietta, Mary.
We're going on a long walk.
- Are you tired, Charles?
- No.
- Shall we join them?
- Of course.
- May we?
- Oh, that would be a pleasure.
I wonder where the gig
- will overturn today?
- Do not be cruel.
It always happens. He's a
sailor - on land, unfortunately,
my sister may be tossed
into the ditch!
If I loved a man as she loves
the admiral, I'd do the same.
Nothing would ever separate us.
I would rather be
overturned by him
than driven safely
by somebody else.
Fine words, Louisa.
Bless my soul, that's Winthrop!
I see Henry's finished
the new barn.
We'd better turn back.
I am feeling tired.
Come along, Henrietta.
Now you've come this far,
I ought to call on Aunt Hayter.
- Mary, you will accompany me.
- Certainly not.
you might rest in her kitchen.
No, indeed. Walking back uphill
will do more harm
than sitting in her kitchen
will do good.
I'll rest here, then go home.
Henrietta may rest with me.
She doesn't want to go down
there either, do you, dear?
I will do my duty
to my aunt.
Louisa!
It's most unpleasant,
having such connections.
But I've hardly been
in that house in my life.
Shall we try and glean some nuts
from the hedgerow?
Indeed, yes.
My seat is damp.
I am sure Louisa
has found a better.
Oh, leave her be, Mary.
No. I will not be damp.
I will not be turned back
from a thing
I had determined to do
by the airs and interference
of such a person.
I am not so easily persuaded.
Would she have turned back,
then, but for you?
I am ashamed to say
that she would.
Henrietta's very lucky
to have you for a sister.
Stick always to your purpose,
Louisa, be firm,
I shall like you the more.
Mary has a great deal
too much of the Elliot pride.
We all wish that Charles
had married Anne instead.
Did Charles want to marry Anne?
- Did you not know?
- She refused him?
- yes.
- When was that?
About three years
before he married Mary.
If only Anne had accepted him.
We should have all have
liked her a great deal better.
My parents think
it was Lady Russell's doing.
My brother wasn't philosophical
enough for her taste.
She persuaded Anne
to refuse him.
I had better sit your side,
Anne, if you've had your rest.
Mary.
Anne.
Captain Wentworth, I don't
believe you know Mr Hayter.
Captain Wentworth, Henry.
Good day, sir.
Good day, sir.
Good day, Admiral!
- Sophy.
- Good day.
The ladies must be exhausted!
There is a seat for one.
you'll save full a mile.
Take Anne, she's very tired.
Anne, you must be tired.
Do give us the pleasure
of taking you home.
B- but there is not room,
Mrs Croft.
Nonsense! Sophy and I
will squash up.
Were we all as slim as you,
there'd be room for four.
- But I...
- please.
Right.
Walk on.
Goodbye.
I wish Frederick would spread
a little more canvas
and bring one of those nice
young ladies to Kellynch.
This hesitation's due to peace -
if it were war,
he'd have settled it long ago.
Do you not think your brother
is ready to fall in love?
I think he is ready to make
a foolish match, George.
Anybody between 15 and 30
may have him for the asking.
A little beauty,
a few smiles,
a few compliments of the Navy
and he's a lost man.
Is it a love letter, Frederick?
No, it's from
my old friend Harville.
He's settled in Lyme.
How far away is that?
It's about 17 miles.
I'll ride there tomorrow.
- you're fond of this Harville.
- Indeed I am.
We've had some great sport in
the far corners of the world.
Unfortunately, he's not healthy:
a leg wound from the war.
But if you met him,
you'd love him as I do.
Well, why don't we make a visit?
All together.
I've long had a wish
to see Lyme.
- Oh, yes, Charles.
- Let us go, please. please.
- And Anne, too?
- Of course.
Let it be Anne's treat.
Soon she must leave us for Bath.
We're to go to Lyme, Mary.
I do not like the sea.
Before we enter
Harville's house,
I must warn you that lodging
there is a Captain Benwick,
who was my first lieutenant
on the Laconia.
He was devoted
to Harville's sister,
and was set to marry her
on our return.
But phoebe died
while we were still at sea.
I believe this is it.
Harville!
Damn my eyes,
it does me good to see you!
Any friends of yours
are welcome in my house.
Charles! May I introduce...
Ahem... Forgive me, ladies.
May I introduce
Captain Harville,
Mrs Harville
and Captain Benwick.
- Good day.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm very pleased
to meet you all.
you've certainly cheered us up.
Our home is your home.
you must stay to supper.
Have we food?
Remember what we ate in Minorca?
- Octopus!
- Octopus?
I do admire the Navy!
These sailors have more worth
than any men in England.
And what do you occupy yourself
with in Lyme, Captain Benwick?
I read.
And what do you read,
Captain Benwick?
poetry.
We are living through
a great age for poetry, I think.
- you read it too, Miss Elliot?
- Mmm.
Tell me, do you prefer Marmion
or The Lady Of The Lake?
Like the dew on the mountain,
Like the foam on the river,
Like the bubble on the fountain,
Thou art gone and forever.
Fare thee well, thus disunited,
Torn from every nearer tie.
Seared in heart
and lone and blighted,
More than this I scarce can die.
I do not know that one.
- Byron.
- Ah.
you... you ought,
perhaps, to include
a larger allowance of prose
in your daily study.
Too much poetry may be... unsafe.
Thank you for your kindness,
but you cannot know
the depth of my despair.
phoebe would have married me
before I went to sea,
but I told her...
I told her
we should wait for money.
Money!
Come, now, Captain Benwick.
Come, now. you will rally again.
you must.
you have no conception
of what I have lost.
yes, I have.
- Good morning, Anne.
- Good morning.
We were just returning
for breakfast.
We shall join you.
Oh, madam. I do apologise.
It is nothing, sir.
Look, kippers for breakfast!
Fetch me some toast and jam.
Toast?!
Whose carriage is that,
landlord? It looks pretty fine.
A gentleman of means, sir.
He come in on his way
to Bath, a Mr Elliot.
Mr Elliot?
Mr Elliot?
Oh, it's the man
we passed on the beach.
Bless me, it must be our cousin!
Did his servant say
if he was a Kellynch?
No, ma'am. Though he do say
he'll be a baronet.
There, it's him! Mr Elliot,
the heir to Kellynch Hall.
Did you notice
the Elliot countenance?
I was looking at the horses,
but I think he had
some Elliot countenance.
Do not you, Anne?
How very extraordinary.
What a pity we didn't
introduce ourselves.
Mary, Father and Mr Elliot have
not spoken for several years.
They would not wish us
to introduce ourselves.
Quite lucky
you didn't bump into him.
Where's my toast?
I have enjoyed our debates.
I too.
- I wonder if I might...
- Mmm?
That is...
yes.
Oh, I don't like it.
Catch me!
Louisa, be careful.
There!
Louisa. Louisa, stop it!
Louisa, it's too high!
I am determined, Captain.
Do not be so foolish!
- Louisa's dead!
- Oh, God!
No, she breathes!
- What shall I do?
- Rub her hands.
Louisa. Louisa.
Oh, God!
Fetch a surgeon.
No! Benwick will know
where to go.
yes, of course.
Carry her to the Harvilles'.
Gently!
A message should be sent
to Uppercross directly.
And Henrietta should be taken
home to her mother.
Either you or I must go,
Charles.
I cannot leave my sister.
Lay her in my bed.
Well, I think it should be Anne.
No one's so capable as Anne.
you will stay, won't you?
Stay and nurse her.
Why should I go instead of Anne?
Anne is nothing to Louisa,
I am family.
- Really, it is too unkind!
- please, Mary.
No. Let Anne take Henrietta.
If only I... If only...
yes.
Anne?
I regret that...
Damned foolish!
Damned foolish! Get up!
Oh, my Louisa.
Go to the stable
and prepare the chaise.
you, y... you, saddle the grey.
Thomas. Thomas!
Thomas, come and take this cart.
- Ma'am.
- Barnaby.
Mama!
She'll live.
Mama.
Mama, she's conscious!
Mama, she'll live!
It always rains in Bath.
I'm pleased to have you
here with us, Anne.
Thank you, Father.
you'll make a fourth at dinner.
That must be deemed
an advantage.
you may observe
that one handsome face
will be followed
by thirty frights.
Once, when I was standing
in a shop in Bond Street,
I counted eighty-seven women
go by,
without there being
a tolerable face among them.
But then, it was
a frosty morning,
which scarcely one woman in a
thousand can stand the test of.
As for the men,
they are infinitely worse.
The streets are
full of scarecrows.
Mr Elliot is hardly a scarecrow.
Mr Elliot is not
ill-looking at all.
Mr Elliot? Our cousin?
Mr Elliot's been most attentive
during my time in Bath.
He's come to call on us
every day.
He's a most engaging friend,
Colonel Wallis.
- But I thought...
- We may see him this afternoon,
and then you shall perceive
what a gentleman he is.
And such fine manners.
I saw him, in fact, in Lyme.
- Saw whom?
- Mr Elliot.
We met by chance at Lyme.
- perhaps it was Mr Elliot
- It was.
Well, I don't know!
It might have been... perhaps.
What's the news, Sir Walter?
A concert in the Assembly Room.
- To be given in Italian.
- Hmm.
A display of fireworks.
But here is news indeed.
Most vital news!
Father?
The Dowager Lady Dalrymple
and the Honourable Miss Carteret
are arrived in Laura place.
- Our cousins.
- Will they receive us?
They would not snub us, surely?
please, God,
let them not snub us!
- Mr Elliot.
- Sir Walter, ladies.
- Mr Elliot.
- I was passing by.
- Come in, come in.
- Mr Elliot.
you do not know
my younger daughter, Anne.
Oh, but we have had a glimpse
of each other, Sir Walter.
On the seashore at Lyme.
I heard of the accident
after I left.
- Is the young lady...?
- She's making a good recovery.
Thank you, Mr Elliot.
But slowly.
Good. I'm glad.
It must have been distressing.
yes.
Which young lady?
One of the Musgroves.
Louisa.
Oh... Farmer's daughter.
Mr Elliot, a guest
at Catherine place. Mr Elliot?
Mmm. He paid his respects
after luncheon
and was received
with great cordiality.
But they have not spoken since
his most inappropriate marriage.
But he is now a widower
and desires reconciliation.
He holds my father
in high esteem.
It's natural that
now he's older,
Mr Elliot should appreciate
the value of blood connection.
- Good morning, Lady Russell.
- Good morning.
Has he manners?
Very good manners
and correct opinions,
and a wide knowledge
of the world.
This is all most agreeable.
The heir presumptive reformed
and on good terms
with the head of his family.
Most agreeable.
I suspect Mr Elliot also wishes
to be on good terms
with my sister, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth?!
Elizabeth is many hours
at her dressing table
when Mr Elliot is expected.
Lady Willoughby,
Sir Henry, good morning.
Did you attend
the philosophical Society?
- yes.
- Was the resolution carried?
It was. The atheists
were thoroughly routed.
- Did dear Sir William speak?
- He did...
Oh, I am pleased to see you!
Miss Anne!
We are here to improve
the Admiral's health.
- What is the problem?
- Dry land, my dear!
It doesn't agree with my legs.
Oh, dear. Well, come
and take some of this water.
Now that she is settled here,
I cannot suppose myself wanted.
- perhaps I should go home.
- There is no need.
She's nothing to me
compared to you.
My dear madam, as yet
you've seen nothing of Bath.
Do not run away now.
Ah.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
We wait this morning
upon our cousins, Anne.
Lady Dalrymple and the
Honourable Miss Carteret.
- you will accompany us, I hope.
- If you wish.
A Viscountess!
She is a Viscountess!
And family.
Family connections
are always worth preserving.
We shall call and be presented.
your looks are
greatly improved, Anne.
you're less thin in your person,
and your cheeks and complexion
is fresher. What are you using?
Nothing.
I recommend using
Gowland's Lotion during spring.
Mrs Clay uses it and see
what it's done for her!
It's carried away her freckles.
Sir Walter Elliot,
late of Kellynch Hall.
Lady Russell.
Miss Elizabeth Elliot.
Miss Anne Elliot.
And Mrs Clay.
And Mrs Clay.
My father declared it
a notable success.
But I discern no superiority
of manner, accomplishment,
or understanding
in the Dalrymples.
And that is all there is to it.
Good company is always
worth seeking.
Though nothing in themselves,
they collect good company
around them.
My idea of good company,
Mr Elliot, is the fellowship
of clever, well-informed people
who have conversation
and a liberality of ideas.
That's what I call good company.
That is not good company.
That is the best.
Good company requires only
birth, education and manners.
And with regard to education,
it is not very particular.
My dear cousin, the Dalrymples
move in the first set,
and as rank is rank, your being
related will be advantageous.
I perceive your value for rank
to be greater than mine.
you're too proud to admit it.
Am I?
- yes. We're very alike.
- Are we?
In what respect?
In one respect I am certain.
We both feel that
every opportunity
for your father to mix
in the best society
may help divert his attentions
from those who are beneath him.
you presume to know me
very well, Mr Elliot.
In my heart, I know you...
intimately.
Westgate Buildings?
Who is this invalid you visit
in Westgate Buildings?
- Mrs Smith.
- Mrs Smith!
- A widow.
- A widow Mrs Smith!
Is her attraction
that she's sickly?
Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,
you have extraordinary taste.
What revolts other people
is inviting to you.
She is a former school fellow,
and I am spending
this afternoon with her.
Lady Dalrymple's invitation
is most pressing.
Could you not put her off
till tomorrow?
It is the only afternoon
which suits both her and myself.
So, you would snub
Lady Dalrymple
for a Mrs Smith,
lodging in Westgate Buildings.
That you'd prefer
an everyday Mrs Smith
to your family connections
among the nobility?
Mrs Smith - such a name!
Once and for all,
will you accompany us to
a tea party at the Dalrymples?
No, sir. I will not!
I have a prior engagement
with Mrs Smith,
who is not the only widow in
Bath with no surname of dignity!
Do you not
suffer from melancholy?
How could I be melancholy,
when you are come to visit?
- Can you walk at all?.
- No.
But I will not allow sickness
to ruin my spirits.
Did your husband
leave you any money?
Very little. His affairs
had utterly collapsed.
And it's all spent
on Nurse Rooke.
Who, besides carrying me
into the hot bath,
brings me my one
source of consolation,
delicious gossip
from the world outside.
So you are a spy, Nurse Rooke.
I keep my ears open, that's all.
What have you heard
of my friend here?
I know her cousin, Mr Elliot,
thinks terribly highly of her.
How on earth do you know that?
I attend
on Colonel Wallis's wife,
who's indisposed with a baby.
And she says
that Colonel Wallis says
that Mr Elliot...
That's quite enough!
you see, Anne.
There are no secrets in Bath.
you remember my brother-in-law,
- Frederick.
- yes?
We thought he was
to marry Louisa Musgrove.
How do you do?
He courted her week after week.
yes.
The only wonder was
what were they waiting for?
Until the business
at Lyme happened.
When it was clear they must wait
till her brain was set to right.
Now the matter has taken
the strangest turn of all.
Frederick has removed
to Shropshire.
- Morning.
- How d'you do?
And the young lady,
instead of marrying him,
is to marry James Benwick!
you know James Benwick.
I... am a little acquainted
with Captain Benwick. yes.
She is to marry him.
I confess, I am amazed.
Certainly, it's unforeseen,
but it's true.
We have it in a letter
from Frederick himself.
But their minds
are so dissimilar!
yes, but they were thrown
together several weeks, and...
Louisa, just recovering
from illness,
was in an interesting state.
No doubt Louisa will become an
enthusiast for Scott and Byron.
Aye. That's learned already.
Of course!
Of course, they fell
in love over poetry!
So, Frederick is
unshackled and free.
And, erm... is he bitter?
Oh, not at all. Not at all!
The letter is sanguine.
There's barely an oath in it
from beginning to end.
you would not think
from his way of writing
that he'd ever thought about
this young... What's her name?
Louisa.
yes, Louisa, for himself at all.
So, poor Frederick
will have to begin again
with somebody else.
Oh, that's better.
Oh, this rain.
I'm sure Mr Elliot
will return in a moment.
I believe
that Molland's marzipan
is as fine as any in Bath.
Do not you, penelope?
Oh... yes.
It is... it is quite...
I've found
Lady Dalrymple's carriage.
She's pleased
to convey you home.
She has, alas,
room only for two.
It's no trouble to me to walk.
Nonsense, you have a cold!
Anne can walk.
No, really. you might show me
that parasol you mentioned?
you'll ruin your shoes.
Anne has thick boots on.
Mr Elliot, would you be so kind?
I should be delighted
to escort Miss Anne.
Then that's settled.
please tell the coachman
that we are ready.
Miss Anne?
A... are you unwell?.
I will just... I will just
get some water.
Excuse me.
Good morning, Captain Wentworth.
Miss Elliot.
So, you are come to Bath.
Well, yes I... I am.
Do you like it?
- Bath?
- Mmm.
I have yet to see it.
your family?
- yes?
- Are they in health?
They are. They are, thank you.
And you? Are you i-in health?
I am very well,
thank you, Captain.
Lady Dalrymple's carriage
for the Miss Elliots.
That's us.
you are not going too?
There is no room. I shall walk.
- It's raining.
- Very little.
Nothing that I regard.
I- I like to walk.
Though I only came yesterday,
I'm armed for Bath.
please, take it.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting.
Shall we set off,
the rain has eased?
Good morning, Captain.
How do you do, Captain?
Well, thank you, Miss Elliot.
you have come for the concert?
No, a lecture on navigation.
Am I in the wrong place?
I have hardly seen you since
that wretched day at Lyme.
I'm afraid you must have
suffered from the shock.
The more so for not
overpowering you at the time.
I was not in danger
from suffering
from not being overpowered,
thank you, Captain.
When you sent Captain Benwick
for a surgeon,
I'll bet you had little idea
of the consequences.
No, I had none.
But I hope it will be
a very happy match.
Indeed, I wish them well.
They have no difficulties
at home.
No opposition,
no caprice,
no delays.
And yet...
Louisa Musgrove is a very
amiable, sweet-tempered girl,
and not unintelligent, but...
Benwick is more... He's
a clever man, a reading man,
and I do view...
suddenly attaching himself
to her like that...
a man in his situation,
with a broken heart...
phoebe Harville was a wonderful
woman and he was devoted to her.
A man does not recover from
such a devotion to such a woman.
He ought not... he does not.
Did you stay long at Lyme?
A fortnight.
Until we were assured
of Louisa's recovery.
The country is very fine.
I walked and rode a great deal.
- I should like to see it again.
- I would have thought...
I mean, the distress...
too painful.
But when the pain is over...
I have travelled so little,
every new place interests me.
One day, I should very much
like to see it again.
It was my doing. Solely mine.
Louisa would not
have been obstinate,
if I had not been weak.
Anne,
I have never...
Lady Dalrymple.
Lady Dalrymple.
May I have the pleasure?
".. and after they
have done this,
"their two hearts will...
"combine in eternal union. "
That's the literal meaning
of the words,
to give the sense
would not be proper.
Besides, I am a poor
Italian scholar.
yes. I see you are
you have only enough
of the language
to translate it at sight into
clear, comprehensible English.
We'll say no more of your
ignorance, here's the proof
I'd hate to be examined
by a real proficient, Mr Elliot.
you are too modest.
The world is not aware of half
of your accomplishments.
This is too much flattery.
I couldn't ever
flatter you enough.
yes, a very well-looking man.
More air than one
often sees in Bath.
- Irish, I dare say.
- Captain Wentworth of the Navy.
An acquaintance. His sister's
married to a tenant of mine.
Do you take my meaning, Anne,
or must I translate for you?
please excuse me one moment.
Oh, Captain.
Are you leaving already?
yes.
But the music is good,
is it not?
I neither know nor care.
- But will you not...
- What?
- This is too sudden.
- Is it?
- But what's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
Miss Elliot, you must come back
to explain the Italian again.
Miss Carteret's keen
to know what she's to hear.
Good night.
But the next song
is very beautiful.
It's a very beautiful love song.
Is that not worth staying for?
No, there's nothing
worth my staying for.
Anne, it is beginning.
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Thank you.
- Good morning, madam.
Oh, I say, Charles!
Isn't it delightful?.
- Where are you staying?
- At the White Hart
with Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta
and Captain Harville from Lyme.
- Come and see upstairs.
- Oh, yes!
What brings
Mrs Musgrove to Bath?
She's after wedding clothes
for Henrietta and Louisa.
It's so exciting I feel giddy.
A double wedding!
What do you think
for Louisa's hair, Anne?
This one or this one?
Louisa has become so severe,
I wonder she wants a ribbon
in her hair at all!
Give her a book of verse
to hold it instead.
Look who I found, Mama.
- Captain Wentworth!
- Good day.
I have been to the theatre and I
have secured a box for tomorrow.
Oh, yes!
Anne, you will
accompany us, I hope.
I am obliged to you,
Mrs Musgrove, but I cannot.
There's a party at Camden place,
to which you'll all be invited.
An evening party!
If it depended
only on me, Charles,
I should prefer the theatre.
But I have an obligation
to my family.
Then we shall go another time,
when you are free to join us.
- Thank you.
- Captain Harville, sit with me.
I desperately need
a fresh opinion.
I doubt if I could be much help.
perhaps you have not
been in Bath long enough
to learn to enjoy
these parties they give.
They mean nothing to me.
Those who hold them
believe the theatre to be
beneath their dignity.
But I am no card player.
No.
you never were, were you?
Anne, there is Mrs Clay,
standing under the colonnade,
and a gentleman with her.
- Bless me, it's Mr Elliot!
- It cannot be him.
He has gone out of Bath to stay
with his friends in Combe park.
Upon my word,
I know my own cousin. Look!
Is it not Mr Elliot?
But it is an apt match.
To step into your mother's shoes
as mistress of Kellynch.
Anybody capable of thought
must approve it.
He's charming,
but my instinct tells me...
Instinct! It's no time
for instinct. Look at the facts.
The present Mr Elliot is
the most eligible gentleman...
Why has his character altered
so I know him so little?
you do not know him?
He is charming and clever,
but I have never seen
any burst of feeling,
any warmth, fury, or delight.
- you'll come to know him.
- That's not what I want.
Miss Elliot?
A gentleman of the Navy wishes
to meet privately with you.
Concerning Kellynch Hall
in Somerset, he says.
It must be the Admiral.
please excuse me.
I have a commission
from my admiral,
and I must discharge it.
you may think me impertinent,
but remember, I speak for him.
The Admiral is aware...
that everything is settled
for a union between Mr Elliot
and yourself.
It occurs to the Admiral
that once married, you may wish
to return to Kellynch Hall.
I have been charged to tell you
that, if this is what you wish,
the Admiral will cancel his
lease and find another place.
There. I have done my duty.
Do you wish it? Say yes or no
and we are both released.
The Admiral is too kind.
Just say it. yes or no.
Why is everyone assuming that...
Captain Wentworth.
Lady Russell.
you have
an extraordinary ability
to discompose my friend, sir.
you have an extraordinary
ability to influence her, ma'am,
which I find hard to forgive.
Why does the whole town
believe I shall marry him?
- Oh. Shan't you?
- No!
I have to say
I am relieved to hear it.
Why?
Because...
Did you never wonder why a man
who held the honour
of your family like dirt,
who showed no interest
in the Kellynch estate,
should suddenly
show such interest?
What do you know?
I was at Colonel Wallis's
yesterday
and I chanced to hear him
complain to his wife
that Mr Elliot
required another loan.
- But he is rich.
- He was rich. He has lost it.
His lifestyle is a sham.
He lives on borrowed money.
Are you saying he pays
his attentions to me because...
He wants the title and the land.
He heard of your sister's
friend, Mrs Clay...
Who hopes to become
the next Lady Elliot.
And to provide
Sir Walter with a son.
- An heir?
- By marrying you,
he gains some footing
in the family,
exerts his influence
on your father...
.. and keeps his inheritance.
Why didn't you say this before?
We've just learnt it.
How despicable!
Mr Musgrove and my brother,
Hayter, met again...
Good morning, Mrs Musgrove.
Good morning, Mrs Croft.
Oh! They are all shopping, Anne.
But Henrietta has told me to
keep you here till they return.
- please sit with us.
- Thank you.
So, all things considered,
as Henry Hayter was wild about
it and my daughter as bad,
we thought let them marry
now and make the best of it.
At any rate, said I to papa,
it's better
than a long engagement.
Nothing's so abominable
as a long engagement.
Do you know who this is?
- That's Captain Benwick.
- yes.
It was not done
for Louisa Musgrove.
This was drawn at the Cape
for my poor sister.
And now I have the charge
of getting it set for another.
It's too much for me, I confess.
So he undertakes it.
He's writing instructions
to the frame-makers now.
poor phoebe.
She would not have forgotten
him so soon.
It was not in her nature.
It's not for any woman
who truly loved.
Do you claim that for your sex?
We do not forget you
as soon as you forget us.
We cannot help ourselves.
We live at home...
quiet... confined...
and our feelings prey upon us.
you always have business
to take you back into the world.
It's no more man's nature
than women's to be inconstant,
or to forget those they love
or have loved.
I believe the reverse.
I believe...
Are you finished your letter?
Er, not quite. A few lines yet.
Let me just observe that all
histories are against you.
All stories, prose and verse.
I don't think I ever
opened a book
which did not have something
to say on women's fickleness.
But they were written by men.
I suppose so.
If you only understood
what a man suffers
when he takes a last look
at his wife and children.
And watches their boat
while it's in sight
and says, "God knows whether
we will ever meet again. "
If I could only show you...
the glow of his soul
when he does see them once more.
When, coming back
after twelve months
and obliged to put
into another port,
he calculates how soon
he can get them there.
pretending to deceive himself
and saying, "They cannot
be here until such a day. "
But still hoping for them
twelve hours sooner.
And seeing them arrive at last,
as if heaven
had given them wings.
I believe you capable
of everything great and good.
So long as...
if I may...
So long as the woman you love
lives... and lives for you.
All the privilege I claim
for my own sex -
and it is not very enviable,
you need not covet it -
is that of loving longest
when all hope is gone.
Dear Frederick, you and I
must part company, I believe.
One moment, Sophy.
But we shall all meet again
this evening at your party.
Harville. If you're ready,
I'm at your service.
Good morning, Miss Elliot,
and God bless.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Now where on earth have
Henrietta and Mary got to?
Forgive me, Mrs Musgrove.
I left my umbrella.
- Ma'am.
- Good day, Captain Wentworth.
'I can
listen no longer in silence.
'I must speak to you by such
means as are within my reach.
'you pierce my soul.
I am half agony, half hope.
'Tell me not that I am too late,
'that such precious feelings
are gone forever.
'I offer myself to you
with a heart even more your own,
'than when you broke it
eight years and a half ago. '
'Dare not say that man
forgets sooner than woman,
'that his love
has an earlier death.
'I have loved none but you.
'Unjust I may have been,
'weak and resentful I have been,
but never inconstant.
'you alone have brought me
to Bath.
'For you alone,
I think and plan.
'Have you not seen this?
'Can you fail
to have understood my wishes?
'Had I not waited
even these ten days,
'could I have read
your feelings?
'I must go, uncertain
of my fate, but I shall return
'or follow your party
as soon as possible.
'A word, a look will be enough
'to decide whether I enter your
father's house this evening...
'or never. '
Anne?
Anne, is something the matter?
Anne, look at you!
Oh, I-I feel
a little faint, Mrs Musgrove.
Erm... I will go home, if I may.
By all means, my dear.
Go home directly
and take care of yourself,
so you may be fit
for this evening.
Charles, go and call a chair.
No. I assure you, Mrs Musgrove,
I am... I am well able to walk.
Erm... Good morning.
Go on.
Charles,
please assure Captain Wentworth
and Captain Harville
that we hope
to see them tonight.
- That was understood.
- No, I don't think so.
They must come, do you hear?
you'll see them again.
promise me you'll mention it.
Mention it yourself. Frederick,
which way are you going?
I hardly know.
Are you going near Camden place?
If you are,
take Anne to her father's door.
She's done for this morning
and I'm eager to see a gun,
like that double-barrel of mine
you once shot with.
I shall have time
to take her, Charles.
Thank you.
I tried to forget you.
I thought I had.
When Captain Wentworth arrives
you must not monopolise him.
It's a very bad habit of yours.
Aye. Bonaparte has got off Elba
and raised an army in France.
It seems there's
to be another war.
So, you will be leaving
us again, Admiral Croft?
When you make a decision, Anne,
you must stick with it.
There's no going back.
At your age, I found out
what I wanted.
I decided to marry.
And I am married...
until I die.
I hope one day
to see you do the same.
I hope so too.
Miss Elliot,
may we speak a moment?
Have you thought any further
about my offer?
But what offer was that,
Mr Elliot?
My offer to flatter and adore
you all the days of your life.
I haven't had a moment,
Mr Elliot,
to turn my mind to it.
Captain Wentworth
and Captain Harville.
Captain Wentworth, come in!
What will you play? Whist?
I have come on business,
Sir Walter.
Business?
My proposal of marriage to your
daughter Anne has been accepted.
And I respectfully request
permission to fix a date.
Anne?
You want to marry Anne?
Whatever for?
