Have you finally paid your tuition?
Are you listening to me?
Have I finally paid my tuition...
I'm listening.
I'll pay tomorrow.
Tomorrow. Everything tomorrow.
You're unable to take care
of the simplest matter.
You're unfit for life.
I am unfit for life?
What?!
You lack persistence.
You're enthusiastic about everything,
and abandon everything half-done.
Running around some fields,
rings, shmings,
that's all you're interested in!
You don't care in the least
about your father's experience.
Figures!
In any case, do as you please.
You're at an age when
I can't make you do anything.
Good afternoon!
I'm sorry.
You're going out?
But everyone's waiting!
I'm about to serve tea.
When are you coming back?
I don't know.
Do you have some matches?
Let's go dancing.
You'll see how wonderful
we will be together.
Dancing?
I can't dance, and besides
I doubt we could be
wonderful together.
I wish you good night.
Good night, darling!
A glass of brandy, please.
Please pass me those matches.
Here you go.
Will you have a drink with me?
No.
I will have a drink.
What can I get you?
Anything.
Brandy?
Fine.
One brandy.
- Let me introduce myself.
- No.
And I don't want brandy, either.
I'll have some vodka, straight,
I'll pay myself.
Mr. Joe!
You're very amusing!
- You're boring.
- Why?
Because.
But why?
Because you keep
asking questions.
You want, I'll buy you a shot of vodka.
With pleasure.
You're going to let a dance girl
pay for your vodka?
Now you're asking questions.
You're not as thick as you seem.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out
how to get out of this.
Out of what?
Out of everything!
Mr. Joe, two vodkas!
The ones you're paying for?
I've no intention to.
I changed my mind.
Would like to have
a bite to eat?
Hot sausages.
Sausages.
What's your name?
Genowefa.
But I always wanted
to be called Lydia.
I once went to see
this movie, <i>Quo Vadis</i>.
The heroine was
beautiful and noble,
and her name
was Lydia.
In this club,
I go by Lidka.
And you, too, would
like to be
beautiful and noble.
Everyone strives for perfection,
and wants to achieve
inner beauty and nobility.
Who told you that?
A priest.
A priest comes in here?
You've lost your mind?
A priest, when I was
at primary school.
I didn't want to have
you pay for my vodka,
because I feel
sorry for you.
You're either drinking away
your petty savings,
or embezzling someone
else's money.
How do you know?
One develops
a good eye over here.
This time you're wrong.
Today, I'm drinking away
my tuition.
Really?
Mr. Joe, two vodkas.
The gentleman is paying,
of course.
- Why are you sad?
- Not at all.
You'll become a dancer,
and we'll work here together.
But I'm a poor dancer.
Let's see.
Can you stay here
the whole night,
and be with me?
So that I don't have to
wait on those fools.
Very well, I'll stay.
Just don't fall in love with me.
With men like you,
anything is possible.
First of all, you talk too much.
Second, you're going
to waste.
Going to waste?
In a minute you'll tell me
I'm different from other girls,
and that you'd like to escape
with me to a quiet countryside.
You better go home.
I'm not going home.
Because at home,
I feel more or less
the way you do in here.
And about escaping into
some quiet countryside,
we might perhaps
talk later.
Let's dance.
<i>Room number 8</i>
<i>an aged doorman</i>
<i>gave me the key with a smile.</i>
<i>Impatient, in the stairs,</i>
<i>you secretly
kissed my hair</i>
<i>Did golden leaves
outnumber</i>
<i>your caresses,
today I'm no longer sure.</i>
<i>You left so suddenly,</i>
<i>the door ajar,
a wind-blown leaf</i>
<i>fell at my feet.</i>
<i>And then I understood:</i>
<i>it was the end,
now it was time</i>
<i>to bid farewell.</i>
<i>Remember, it was autumn,</i>
<i>room number 8,</i>
<i>and darkness in the hall.</i>
<i>I will never forget</i>
<i>the little Rose Hotel,</i>
<i>although it has
been a year.</i>
They're real whores,
they play grand ladies,
but steal whenever they can,
and each would sell herself
for a broken button.
I will be like them soon.
I'm glad you came.
I needed today precisely
something like you.
Neither fish nor fowl.
This is the first time that I feel
like I came here to have fun.
<i>Darling, come back to me,</i>
<i>I miss you</i>
<i>and may farewells,</i>
<i>my darling</i>
<i>keep us no longer apart.</i>
<i>Stop all the trains,</i>
<i>may the mailman</i>
<i>never deliver bad news</i>
<i>to the little Rose Hotel.</i>
Who are you, anyway?
Ha! I'd like to know
that myself.
Sometimes you speak
like a poet.
It makes no sense,
but it's beautiful.
Why don't you tell me
what you do in life.
I seek positive values.
What does it mean?
It doesn't mean anything.
I just felt like saying that.
What's the point in saying
whatever you feel like?
After all, we're here
to have fun.
That's true.
<i>You left so suddenly</i>
<i>the door ajar,
a wind-blown leaf</i>
<i>fell at my feet.</i>
<i>And then I understood:</i>
<i>it was the end,
now it was time</i>
<i>to bid farewell.</i>
<i>Remember, it was autumn,</i>
<i>room number 8,</i>
<i>and darkness in the hall.</i>
<i>I will never forget</i>
<i>the little Rose Hotel,</i>
<i>although it has
been a year.</i>
Why didn't you want me
to introduce myself?
Because you would say
that your name is Fikusinski,
or Pikusinski, and we'd
have the same farce,
as every night.
You've no idea how
stupid they are.
Perhaps they're not really
that stupid,
but that's what they
come here for.
I know them
in and out.
I'm glad to find you here.
Ah, Lidka,
you are a simple girl,
but very intelligent,
and I like you a lot.
Really
I really like you.
Where the first stars
light up in the sky,
there I will travel,
beyond the shadowy rocks.
I will glance at
swans flying across the sky,
and I will fly,
where they are flying.
Beautiful, maestro,
when did you write it?
That wasn't me.
That's Juliusz Slowacki.
We haven't met,
although you must have
recognized me by now.
I'll be off
chasing skirts.
He's not as stupid
as all the others.
He is really stupid.
In his real life, too.
...than all other
women I meet
It's only with you, Basia,
that I feel rested.
Because, you see,
deep down, I'm a simple
friendly guy
and what I'd like best of all,
is to escape
to some charming corner,
because I love nature
above all else.
I would put
my head in your lap,
and read poetry.
Oh, how I love poetry!
He fucking loves everything.
Meanwhile she plays
indifferent,
and tries to figure out
how to skin him alive.
He wallows
in self-pity,
and tries to figure out
how to get her in bed.
It's filthy, a club like this,
with dance girls.
I'm cold.
Let's get out of here.
Where to?
Some quiet corner.
In some quiet countryside.
Wait for me in the coatroom.
Mr. Joseph!
You're leaving already?
- This is the best act.
- Ok, ok, bring my coat.
Are we going yet?
Where are we going?
I don't know.
Hey, how did you sleep?
Excellent!
I found some interesting things.
Have a look.
An earthworm.
How funny.
What is it looking for?
What can it want?
Please throw away
this disgusting maggot.
And besides, pull down
your skirt.
Why does it bother you?
I'm hot.
It's indecent.
Indecent is what
indecent sees.
I might just take it
the wrong way.
I was kidding. You can wear
your skirt anyway you like.
You know...
I won't go back to Warsaw,
and they'll kick me out of the club.
You know, I won't go back, either,
and they'll kick me out of the house.
Good.
And what will we
do at night?
Night is still far away.
Night is still far away.
It had never occurred to me,
that you could just get away
a few miles outside the city,
poke at a puddle with a stick,
stretch out in the sun,
and it'd be all ok.
Miss Lidka,
where do you live?
At hit-and-miss
Bing-Bang street.
I used to live in
Praga district.
And now I live
in the grass,
with earthworms,
butterflies,
with you...
Why are you so grim?
Aren't you amused
by what I'm saying?
No.
- You're mad.
- Yes.
- About what?
- I'm hungry.
Come on now,
no more fooling around.
Get up or we'll be late.
We'll go to Forest Hoof.
We'll go to Forest Hoof.
I could use a good dinner.
Vegetable soup, chicken,
and ice-cream.
Aha, and some salad.
I'd like a good dinner, too.
Vegetable soup, chicken,
and ice-cream.
Aha, and a salad.
I think there should be
a train after 2.
I think there should be
a train after 2.
Stop mocking me.
Stop mocking me.
Stupid ass!
Stupid goat!
Can we get something to eat?
Get?
Somehow we're all out.
What do you mean
all out?
- Out of everything?
- Ahem.
- Perhaps I can find something.
You have chickens.
No, we don't.
- Maybe some vegetable soup?
- Nope.
Maybe ice-cream?
No. We've got nothing.
Some sausage?
None.
Perhaps a dinner, though.
And what's for dinner?
I'll go find out.
And bring two light
beers right away.
There's no dinner.
You can have boiled sausage.
And beer?
What beer?
The beer I ordered
just a minute ago.
- You ordered?
- I did.
We're out of beer.
Might have some,
but only dark.
That'll do.
Dark?
Clearly, dark.
I'll bring it in a second.
- And the sausage, should I serve it?
- Yes, and quickly.
And where are we
going to sleep?
We'll find a room.
- At a hotel?
- There're no hotels here, just B&Bs.
Bed & breakfast.
Clean starched sheets...
A record player...
The maid wearing
a white bonnet...
I've never stayed at a B&B,
- but that's how I picture it.
- Why?
I don't know.
You see, there is dinner.
That's what I've been
saying all along.
No, you said there's sausage.
There's no sausage,
only dinner.
- Do you want me to take it away?
- Leave it, let go!
What's for the main course?
Meat loaf,
or goulash.
What would you prefer?
- How did you like it?
- Quite.
Let's get away from here.
Here. Only here.
Why here?
- I don't like it here.
- But I do.
- What do you like?
- It's called "Quo vadis"!
Quo vadis. What do I care
it's called Quo vadis?
It's a ramshackle!
- At least I hope there're no rooms.
- I hope there are.
And I won't sleep
anywhere else.
You're looking
for something?
Would it be possible
to rent a room?
It would.
Will you be staying long?
We're not sure yet.
We'll stay as long as we like.
We're not rushing anywhere.
Newly-weds?
Yes.
We're coming straight
from the wedding.
Congratulations, congratulations.
Congratulations.
Please, come in, come in.
We came here on our honeymoon.
We work at a post-office.
I sell stamps...
I mean, my wife sells stamps,
and I receive wires.
We can't afford to
travel to foreign countries...
I myself am poor.
I would never rent a room
to any rich person.
The rich live on the
misery of the poor.
Whereas one poor person
won't let another come to harm,
will they?
Naturally.
All poor people are brothers.
Except poor women...
- who are sisters...
- Yes, brothers and sisters!
And your luggage?
- No luggage.
- How come?
Poor people don't have luggage.
- You should know that.
- Ah, that's true!
I'll take you to your room.
- What happened?
- Nothing. It's a bit dark,
my wife tripped.
Are you crazy, why did you
come out with that wedding?
So, have I lied?
We are coming from a wedding.
Anyway, what harm will
it do to you?
Misalliance?
Please come in.
It's a dream room.
A dream room for newly-weds.
I'll make your bed in a minute.
Will you have anything
to eat in the meantime?
- Can we have something for supper?
- But of course.
You can have anything you want.
Perhaps you'd like to
buy a clock?
I have a beautiful clock, a perfect
wedding gift for your bride.
Perhaps you might have
a dog for sale?
Certainly.
I do have a dog for sale.
I'll bring it in a second
and show you.
Have you gone crazy
with the dog?
Why? I'm not allowed
to get a dog?
I also want something
I can take care of.
I can't have an
earthworm as a pet.
And take it out for walks.
Stop fooling around.
And take that stupid garland
off your head.
If I'd said we were colleagues
from the post office,
we would have gotten
separate rooms.
And you had to
have us marry.
And what's wrong
with sharing a room?
Already sick of
my company?
- But it's inappropriate.
- Ah, having bad thoughts again?
Here's a dog for you.
But that's a cat.
Ah, a cat!
But it's very friendly.
It knows a lot of tricks,
and gets attached
Even better than a dog!
Much better! I'll you have it cheap!
No, I want a dog.
And here's the record player
you asked for.
I see you like it.
I would have never
parted with it,
if not for the fact that
you've just married.
I'll sell it cheap.
30 zlotys.
Please take it away
immediately.
Let's make it 5.
You can have both for 5:
the cat and the record player.
I beg you, please go away already.
We'd like to have supper.
- I'll find something else.
- Don't look.
Quo vadis, bloody hell.
But I like it here.
If you don't like it,
go back to Warsaw.
That woman is funny.
Who do you think she is?
Her husband was a wealthy merchant.
They were in love,
bought this house.
They wanted to spend their
time together here.
Everything would have been fine,
if she hadn't
developed the possessive drive.
She started to love her
house more than her husband.
The wealthy merchant worried sick,
until one day he said:
"I'm going out to the movies."
"I'll be back shortly."
But never came back.
And vanished without a trace.
That was forty years ago.
The merchant's wife
lost her mind,
and since then, aimlessly
wanders round the empty house.
People avoid the house.
What a riot! How do you know
these things?
How could I know?
I'm just guessing.
You must be tired.
I'm quite sleepy myself.
Why don't you wait a minute
out in the hallway.
Or else you might
see the devil himself.
Hello? Please connect me
with Warsaw 243.
Hania?
What are you up to?
Mr. & Mrs. have been worried sick.
Are they home?
No, they're out looking
for you in the city.
Very good, Hania...
Please tell them I'm
in Forest Hoof,
at the Quo Vadis house.
You can also tell them
that I'm here
with a dance girl.
And that her company
suits me very well.
Have you been a dance girl
for long?
Why do you care?
You could give a polite answer
to the man with whom
you're spending the night.
For three weeks.
- That's not very long.
- Long enough.
Would you like to
change your life completely?
I don't believe you.
That I would like to?
I don't believe
that one can change.
In that case, one
would have to
change everything.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
You mean I should go back
to that joint and become a whore?
- No, God forbid, not at all.
- What then?
I'm supposed to wait
for you to change the world
and allow me to stroll the earthly
paradise as an angel?
I won't let you go to waste.
As if I were asking for your permission.
Missionary from the boondocks.
Very well.
Good night.
Good night.
Let the bedbugs bite.
Are you asleep?
Almost.
Tell me, please,
an earthworm, you know,
when it crawls, it moves like this,
is it because it wants something?
But does it know what
it wants or not?
And do you know what you want?
In general, I guess I don't.
Precisely.
And you move.
You even speak.
Even when you should
be long asleep.
Whatever.
Good night.
Are you asleep?
Well, keep sleeping then.
How did you sleep?
Well.
I dreamt the whole night
I was an earthworm,
and you were walking me
on a leash in the woods.
What's with the jacket?
I'm sewing a button for you.
Is it worth talking about?
No, it's not.
I'm hungry.
I'll ask the maid and she'll
bring you breakfast.
For God's sake, stop doing that.
Come in.
I'm glad you came.
I just wanted to have a word with you.
Lidka, please allow me to
introduce my father.
Father, this is Miss Lidka Genowefa...
I'm sorry, what's your family name?
I haven't had the pleasure yet.
Pondalinska.
Please sit down.
True, no place to sit.
Lidka...
- Perhaps I should leave?
- No, on the contrary, I'd rather you stayed.
- What does all this mean?
- Nothing special.
Well, perhaps the appearances
don't speak in our favor.
Well, anyway.
Well. Anyway.
Please get dressed
this very minute!
And come back home with me.
As for you, Miss,
I am prepared to
offer you recompense
for any wrongs committed by my son.
The wrongs committed by your son
add up to 2354 zlotys and 17 groszy.
Please don't make a mockery out of this.
Please try to understand:
you two are worlds apart.
And your relationship
wouldn't make anyone happy.
You stand in the way
of his career.
What career?
You never know.
Sooner or later, you'll have to
pursue some sort of career.
I won't pursue any career.
Please don't look.
Your notion of morality
is outdated.
There is only one morality,
and it's always up to date.
Yes, if that meant
being kind to other people.
The egg wants to
outsmart the chicken.
As usually, you are being
an impractical idealist.
Listen, then:
here's a girl I met
yesterday at a night club.
If life circumstances were different,
she would be a fine woman.
But she, in that joint,
has only one choice.
To become a whore.
For God's sake,
watch your tongue,
and in the presence of a woman.
He's right.
I'll become a whore regardless
of what your noble son decides.
Listen carefully.
I won't come back home
until you promise me
that you will take care of this girl.
You will give her an honest job,
and a chance at a decent life.
But you think that she
- can handle an honest job?
- She can.
In any case, you think
you are going to change the world
if we pull one girl
out of the gutter?
The world is as it is,
and it can't be any different.
Come now, no reason
to get upset.
We will do something for you.
Leave me in peace.
Get out, both of you.
Here it is!
I'll buy it.
And this is Mr. Wojciech Pondalinski.
My wife's father.
What is this tomfoolery?
I'd like to ask you
to pay for that puppy.
Would you, father?
But of course.
My father-in-law placed some bets
with the bookies, and won
quite a large sum of money recently.
He came to take us to foreign countries.
How much for the dog?
And I'm paying the whole bill.
For the doggy, 30 zlotys.
Out of question.
- 15, along with the cat and the record player.
- No.
Let's make it 5, then.
But without the cat
and the record player.
Without the cat and the
record player it will be 7.
Dear lady, this should settle it.
Go have breakfast together.
I'll shower, shave,
stop at a barber's
and meet you at the station.
He's cute, isn't he?
Adorable, Miss Lidka.
Adorable.
Here's my address, Miss Lidka.
We shall meet soon, then?
<i>Warsaw Courier</i>
I'll get a paper.
Let's go.
Good bye.
They're talking about nothing
but war. That's funny.
There will be no war.
What is it?
Miss Lidka won't be
coming with us?
No, she's staying here.
I'm not waiting any longer.
But I told you that I have
an aunt in Forest Hoof.
You're always going on
about that aunt,
but there's no money in sight.
I don't even know
if there ever was any
aunt, or no aunt,
but not a penny in sight!
- What is this supposed to mean?
- For instance what?
Get out of my room
immediately!
This isn't your room.
At best, the room you rent.
But because you're not paying,
you're not even renting it!
And in any case,
it's not your room!
If you put money
here, right here,
I'll give you the keys,
and then it will
be your rented room.
Is that all you've
got to say to me?
I can't remember ever talking
about anything else to you.
May God punish you.
Stop trying to scare me
with Bolsheviks.
Unfortunately, Ala & Witek
won't be able to come today.
They had to pay for
their replacements.
They had promised the Leons to play bridge.
But they'll come tomorrow, won't they?
They said they would for sure.
What are you doing here?
Are you going anywhere?
Yes, I am.
Where, if you don't mind?
To Cracow, I think.
To Cracow! Yes, yes....
But ... the road is very dangerous.
In Skierniewice, every single day,
they search the whole train!
- Really?
- Yes.
- And what is it like over here?
- Oh, well...
Just as you see.
Oh, just take a look around.
That is a supreme court judge.
A supreme court judge, sir,
with a shovel, going to dig ditches..
To dig trenches.
- Aren't these marvelous times?
- And you,
professor?
Marvelous times.
But, you'll see, everything
will be alright.
Really? You have any news?
No, it just suddenly
occurred to me that
it'll be alright.
You'll see.
That it'll be alright.
Good bye.
Trading goods?
Yes, goods.
- What do you deal in?
- Whatever I can: sausage, eggs, butter.
You know, I'd buy
some from you.
My wife's nagging,
asking for a sales stand.
She says, all women got one,
except her.
- Perhaps you could bring something?
- Why not.
Could I leave it with you?
I don't want to haul it around,
I still have to take care of something.
Go ahead. You can leave it
in the guard booth.
Over there?
Thank you.
- Is Mrs. Siekerzynska home?
- I will see.
Who should I say is asking for her?
Please tell her
that her nephew came.
You may come in.
You rascal.
Making your aunt wait
so long,
and she had to cheat death
just to get her nephew's attention.
Tell me all about yourself.
Did you fight in the uprising?
- No, I didn't.
- That's very bad.
Your great-grandfather
fought in an uprising,
your grandfather,
and what did you do?
Nothing!
That's your father's fault.
Has it been long since
you last heard from your mother?
Sometime... before the uprising.
Well, they're still in London,
doing well, but worried about me.
- Father was ill a little...
- You can spare me
the details of your father's health.
And worry...
That's too bad.
If someone abandons their
child to his fate,
afterwards, they must worry!
But, Auntie, I was at the front
when they ran away,
and, after all, I'm not a baby.
Now, now, then.
Every snotty brat
seems to think these days
that he's all grown up.
You're haggard
but not grown up.
Mon pauvre gosse,
you look terrible.
Tiens, put away
this little coin.
Or not.
So much money, you might lose it,
or drink it away.
Take this.
Thank you.
You have a guest, Walercia?
But, my dear Rose,
this is my nephew.
My God...
I remember you very well.
I carried you in my arms.
When was that? 1918...
But no, 1916.
28 years ago,
my dear Walercia
Please, don't let me interrupt you.
- I think I'll get going.
- Where?
I don't want to intrude.
Intrude? Not at all,
unless on Rose?
Rose, are we bothering you?
My dear Walercia, if you don't stop
talking to me this way,
you'll force me to take
my books...
Alright, alright,
my dear Rose.
You can't even appreciate
how wonderful she is,
my Rose,
At any given time and place,
she thinks only about others
and never about herself.
Her situation is just as
Poland's today:
dans son territoire, mais pas chez soi.
Walercia, stop it,
or you'll make me angry.
You won't even let me
give you the praise you deserve.
And yet I will never
stop repeating
that you're a pearl and
and an exception.
You finally came.
We've been waiting
for you two days.
Card games,
drunkenness.
None of your suspicions
are true.
I was playing with a kitten.
Mirek, you're talking
nonsense.
The longer all this lasts,
- the more I like to play with cats.
- Mirek!
My God, one is so
preoccupied these days
that one forgets the basic
rules of hospitality.
Let me introduce
my nephew.
Mirek, this is the nephew of
my dear and gentle Walerka.
Very nice to meet you.
I hope you'll become friends.
I am convinced that this
friendship would be good for you,
you spoiled naughty boy.
I would be very glad.
Mirek, what are you doing?
What is this supposed to mean?
Darling, please forgive me,
I met this
you know, this...
and we went...
- But...
- But I've no intention of
listening to your nonsense,
and enduring your madness.
This is repeating too often.
This must end.
Lidka, we have a guest.
Let me introduce the nephew
of my dear Walerka.
We know each other.
You've met already?
That's for the better.
I'm very sorry...
- but I must be going.
- That's for the better.
You're leaving already?
I thought you might
stay for breakfast.
Thank you, but I got up
very early today and had
my breakfast at home.
But I mean a real breakfast,
but since you're in a hurry...
I hope you will stop by
again some time.
Go, go now, but don't forget
about your old aunt.
If you had anything to trade,
soft, hard, powdered, or
in one piece, no difference,
you'll do best to come to me.
Can you exchange a 50 dollar note?
Why not, do you have many?
Right now only two.
No problem. I'll pay
450 each.
You must admit, I pay well.
Elsewhere, they'd rob you blind.
Here you go.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm really very sorry.
Leave me be,
I'm very irritable today.
Because of you, I made
such a fool out of myself
in front of him.
In front of whom?
That...
That nephew of aunt Walerka.
Please go after him
and apologize.
Or invite him to our place
for supper.
Well, go on now.
Are you really in such a hurry?
Forgive me for
stopping you.
Am I in a hurry?
No, in fact, I'm not
at all in a hurry.
Is there anything today
we could be hurrying for?
If you're really not in a hurry,
perhaps you'll
agree to have a drink?
Or something like that?
With pleasure. Only
I won't agree to
Let's not start our
friendship with fussing.
My invitation, my treat,
agreed?
Agreed.
In fact, I wanted to apologize.
My wife
was a little upset
it seems she might
have been a bit rude to you.
Oh, that's nothing.
It often happens when
one is irritated.
You'd met before,
right?
We had.
How did you end up
here in all this chaos?
How did I?
- I was in Pruszków.
- What a nightmare.
I must admit that it seemed
quite idyllic to me.
I had spent two years
in Auschwitz.
Two years...
... in Auschwitz...
What does a man feel like
back at large
after years in that hell?
Not sure I know.
You see, luckily, man
has the gift of forgetting,
without which life wouldn't
be at all possible.
I remember only...
that might seem strange...
that I was no longer able
to enjoy freedom
in the same measure
I had desired it.
When I got out,
I rented a room,
and stayed there
for weeks on end,
staring at the ceiling,
not thinking,
not even suffering...
At times I thought
that everything was over.
The camp might have been
only an indirect cause
of my state...
And the direct cause?
I'm not sure...
But probably everything:
life before the war,
the war,
the present,
life.
I understand.
You know,
sometimes I feel like bidding
farewell to all my loved ones,
to everyone,
and escaping
doesn't matter where,
but I can never
make up my mind.
Nobody really understands that.
I'm listening.
It's not just the question
of the occupation, I think.
The Germans...
History is over for us.
Round-ups, torture,
perhaps they still pose a threat,
but deep within
deep within,
they no longer matter.
- That may be so.
- Yes, but what next?
What is there to go back to
after all this?
Before the war,
I felt the same urge
to escape from my world.
My aunt was right,
friendship with you
will do me good.
No, no more, thank you.
Let's go, I need to take care
of something before 3.
And your big breakfast
must be waiting.
And I know, your meal times
are sacred.
Your?
Let's say ours, then.
I came out looking for you.
Felix said there
may a round-up.
Peaceful as in heaven.
Felix spreads panic
to jumpstart stock prices.
Felix is always impossible.
I would have fired him
long ago.
You invited him over,
haven't you?
- You'll come?
- Naturally.
- Thank you.
- We will be expecting you tonight?
Tonight?
Unfortunately, tonight would
be a bit difficult.
- Perhaps tomorrow?
- Very well, tomorrow I can make it.
Good bye.
I'm very glad
you'll be able to come.
So am I.
Pay the bill.
And let's get out of here.
Felix, have you told the mistress
about any round-ups today?
No, sir, I know nothing
about any round-ups.
And I have not seen the
young countess today at all.
Countess...
Excuse me?
Shit.
It's you.
And your wife?
Is she coming?
We've got separated.
And I've nowhere to stay,
and I thought that perhaps
you might let me a room.
But of course!
I wouldn't to a stranger,
but to you I will.
But I must watch out.
Never let in any strangers.
They want to rob me.
- Who, the Germans?
- No.
- They.
- Who, they?
They.
They're not here, yet,
but they'll be here shortly.
In the meantime, I must watch
out, they have spies around.
After the wedding
you had no luggage.
That's... loot,
from Warsaw.
Loot.
Yes, that's what I thought,
it must be loot.
And your wife, she'll come
here when you find her?
Yes, she will.
We had agreed that
if we got separated,
we'd find each
other precisely here.
That's good, at my place.
And the dog?
Dog?
- The dog will come, too.
- How is it?
In great shape.
It's had six
litters since.
Beautiful puppies.
That's very strange.
It wasn't a bitch
only a male.
But now, there are such
things going on in the world
that one can hardly
be surprised at anything.
Please, come in.
Should I change sheets?
Probably not,
it's still the same.
No one's been here since.
This is the key to
the door downstairs.
But please be careful,
and leave quietly.
So they won't see that someone
is living here.
Because they would come
and take everything.
The count is awaiting
you in the playroom.
Don't play a comedy
in front of me.
Would you take me on
as a go-between in your...
dollar deals?
Why not. If there's
anything, just come to me.
I'll give you a share
right away, of course.
Count Tolo.
For a month now.
And hasn't complained.
I'm telling you,
think it over.
Won't you stay for supper?
Oh, no, I can't.
They've had a room ready
for me since 6.
Talk to Lidka.
She also
thinks it's the only
and the best chance.
Tolo.
I hope we'll meet again.
Good bye.
Lidka... My wife
will be down in a second.
How are you?
I'm staying in Forest Hoof,
there's a B&B I know
from before the war.
Why haven't you
just come to stay with us?
Your aunt would not
be too happy about it.
That's possible.
She starts rebelling
against charity.
At least under
her own roof.
It's nice you haven't
forgotten about us.
Please sit down.
Supper will be
served shortly.
You know those two old birds,
Jasia & Kocia, charged in here
and refuse to leave.
Aunt pretends to
be delighted.
But, inside, I see she's seething.
I'm sorry to touch on
such household matters
in your presence.
But today, these are
very common problems.
Excuse me, what problems?
That clown paid you a visit?
Tolo?
Yes, he did.
And probably was trying
to talk you into going to Vienna?
He was.
And what do you think about it?
Vienna...
I'm not sure...
We could go.
- That's what you really think?
- Yes.
Listen, Mirek, we're being
very impolite.
Could you tell us something
about yourself?
How are you doing
these days?
It's nice of you to remember
about us, after all.
My dear Lidka,
our guest must be hungry.
You're finally here,
you naughty boy.
Listen, Lidka,
we haven't waited
for Maryna.
And that's not good.
Maryna asked never to
wait for her with meals.
Around six, I saw her drinking
vodka with the rail men.
Why are you saying such things about Maryna?
She's just crazy.
I've always been saying that.
But I've always liked her a lot
and I still do like her
and respect her. The end.
She is someone...
Of course, everyone
round the trough.
Don't make a big deal.
Just tell me who you are.
This, my dear Maryna,
is my sister's son.
Mon neveu.
Can you translate
for me into Polish
what that parrot
just said?
I am my aunt Walerka's
nephew.
Walerka's nephew.
Probably nothing
interesting.
Pour me some vodka.
Leave it.
You all shouldn't drink too much.
You'd become too jovial
after the losses
you've suffered.
Felix...
Please tell the cook
to hurry up
Our guest must be
heading back tonight.
I live in Forest Hoof now.
Even not too
far from here.
At the Quo vadis inn.
Please pass the bread.
It's right here.
It's really too bad you
haven't come directly here,
What's more, it was
rather inconsiderate on your part.
My dear Rose
You're incorrigible, incorrigible
in your kindness and hospitality.
That's how it is,
my dear.
We're crammed,
but one cannot think
only of one's own comfort
while people suffer
such misfortunes.
Incorrigible, incorrigible.
Rose, where are you off to?
Please, at least finish
your dinner in peace.
Never listens.
She's gone.
No doubt somebody
needs to ask her some favor.
I'm bored with your ugly mugs.
I'm leaving.
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is much talk today
of Communism.
I claim that Communism
is completely impractical.
Let me take myself as an example
This morning, I spilled
some water from a vase
onto the window sill,
and didn't wipe if off
because I didn't feel like it.
And if it were mine,
in my own home, I would
have wiped it off right away,
because I'd be afraid that
the window might rot.
There you go.
Everyone!
A pleasant surprise.
Alive, and safely back with us,
our beloved maestro,
whose art we love
and value dearly
- Please, maestro, have a seat.
- Thank you.
- We were worried...
- She'd never even mentioned his name.
We won't let you go.
You'll stay with us
for the time being.
I won't dare resist.
I didn't know where to go.
I remember your kindness
and your hospitable house.
I would be very
offended, professor,
if you had forgotten about me.
A ship
is sinking.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are completely ruined.
It's a miracle
we've survived.
Calm down, my dear Celina,
calm down,
we're all in the same boat.
Oh, my dear Rose,
if you only knew
what I went through.
I hope you won't refuse us
two, at most three
days of your hospitality.
Of course, my door is open
to all refugees.
But I'm afraid you won't
have all the comforts
because we are more
and more crammed.
I must be going.
Good night.
You still got time
before the curfew.
True, but I must meet
someone.
Whom?
Business.
I hope to see you again soon.
Have you got matches?
Walerka's nephew.
Come have a shot
of vodka with me.
It's getting late.
Nearly curfew.
I'll walk you home,
don't worry.
Come on.
Who's there?
Is there a fire
or what?
My throat's burning,
open up.
Ah, it's you.
Have you got anything?
A quart of vodka,
and something to snack on.
You got it.
Do you have any money,
because I don't.
500 or 600 zlotys.
That's enough.
It'll be on you.
I'll repay you
with a kind word.
In fact, I don't want
anything from you,
but one doesn't always
want to drink alone.
Understood.
We can manage on our own.
We're not at my sister-in-law.
Sausages.
Have a drink.
Lidka's in love with you.
What's it to you?
If that's how you're
going to talk to me,
you bastard, you can
go straight back home.
Please stop it.
I'm not interested
in that subject.
And, anyway, why are you
interested in Lidka and me?
I'm not at all
interested in you.
No more.
An empty glass is
like a coffin without a corpse.
As for Lidka...
Again.
I like her, and I feel
sorry for her.
Life derailed her, and turned
her into a circus horse.
I remember her
from before the war.
Even from afar,
she seemed worthwhile.
I was upset, when
Mirek kidnapped her
from that joint,
like an errant knight
rescuing a maiden
from a glass mountain.
Does Miss Rose know
that Lidka was
a dance girl?
She'd turn in her grave!
What do you mean in her grave?
She's alive.
Yes, she's alive,
but lives in a grave.
She had to be given
a toned-down version.
An actress.
There is something
in the two of you,
I'm not sure I can
find the right word,
something you share.
Ah, to hell with it.
Lidka's lost, you're lost,
leave me in peace.
Yes, we're lost.
You should escape
to the countryside with her,
you'd go out into the field
with a scythe,
Into the field with a scythe...
Maybe you want to me warm up
to the hammer & sickle?
You're an idiot.
I'm not a red baroness.
And I don't plan
on posing as such.
They think I escaped
from my own milieu.
Fools. It's they
who escaped.
Ran away,
went astray.
Enough of that.
Thank you for your company.
There's a gentleman
who wants to speak with you.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
A stranger.
A complete stranger.
I came to inform you
that your aunt
has been taken ill,
- and wishes to see you.
- What happened?
A heart attack.
She even collapsed as she
was leaving the table.
I see.
Please tell her
I'll be there.
Unfortunately, I must
inform you
that it was the last time
I was in countess Rose's house.
- How come?
- I quit.
You. Quit.
Yes. I've had enough of
taking care of her & the house.
Now that God has been
favorable to me,
and I've saved up
a little something,
I decided to start
my own business.
Come with me,
I'll show you something.
I will still be serving
the young couple.
But in a different capacity.
I'm opening a restaurant.
Foreman, would you
come her for a second.
How's work coming along,
Mr. Grzebinski?
- Moving forward.
- When will it be ready?
- You can start on Tuesday.
- For sure?
When I say something,
it's not for sure or not,
it'll be just as I say.
Great.
I am sorry,
I won't be able to facilitate
exchange for you any more,
but as a
recompense,
I'd like to offer you
a job.
Why not? What would I be doing?
You'd serve our
customers,
share in the sales,
and free meals.
Count Tolo is applying
for the job,
but I don't trust him.
I'd rather have you.
Is that settled then?
Settled.
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it,
you've always played fair with me.
Very well, but what does
countess think about all this?
She... She was completely
unfair to me.
She got mad,
and told me to leave
her house immediately.
She said some things which
out of respect for her,
I cannot repeat.
All of them will now be
my best customers.
I will call the place
Chez Felix.
Good evening.
How are you?
As well as it is
even possible today.
And you?
You came out
to walk the dog?
Yes, it needs to
run around.
Earthworm!
- You named him Earthworm?
- Yes.
You don't like it?
Earthworm!
We're going for a walk.
You came.
I could die,
and you wouldn't notice.
This time,
nothing really happened,
but soon, it will be all over.
Paul,
you are my closest relative.
I demand
that you and Rose
follow my hearse.
She is the only
person in the world
who truly loves me.
And here,
something for you
because you came immediately
when you were called to the side
of your sick and dying aunt.
Or not.
You might lose it.
You'd better get everything
- when I'm dead.
- Auntie!
I don't know
whether I was a
good aunt to you.
Whether I knew how to...
I don't know at all...
whether I was good to people.
whether I knew how to...
I couldn't communicate with them,
and they with me,
but I wanted to.
I really wanted to.
Go now, go.
I must
get some rest
and peace.
How's aunt doing?
Better, I think.
Thank God.
Don't go so soon.
I'll tell Felix to...
I forgot...
I keep forgetting that Felix
went out on his own.
You've heard about it?
What do you make of it?
I support his initiative, because
he employed me as a waiter.
I see.
You know, after all, you working
for Felix as a waiter...
No, the whole world
is topsy-turvy.
Some shots were fired at the station.
Now they're patrolling the streets.
It's almost curfew.
Lidka, I think he shouldn't
be leaving now.
You're right.
We won't let you go.
No, I'll better go.
You've got enough headaches.
Mirek, stop him,
it makes no sense.
Really, don't do anything foolish.
You'll spend the night here.
Now, let's go to my study.
This way.
Please come in.
So what do you think
about all this?
What do you intend
to do next?
I'm not sure.
I'm not thinking about it.
It's a bit too late for that.
The train has left
the station.
- You can jump out.
- And break my neck?
No.
That's something I should have
thought about long ago,
before the war.
Well, now, we're
going
where the train
is taking us.
One must run
from one's aunt,
from the Bolsheviks,
from everything that's coming.
Perhaps what we used to
expect and consider
as Poland
will no longer exist.
Yes, these are what we call
our problems.
Tolo's got something lined up.
To go to Vienna,
and on from there.
To run away.
From your own shadow?
Anyway, I won't
give you any advice.
Good night.
Ah, welcome!
Good evening?
How are you enjoying
this hospitality?
You don't mention rope
in a hangman's house.
Rats flee the sinking ship.
And we, too, will probably
flee this house soon.
The air thickens
as population density rises.
And the countess,
unfortunately,
is beginning to
crack.
Time to sleep.
You, young man,
if you expect the gems
of our sense of humor,
you will be sorely disappointed.
I won't say another word today.
To hell with all of this.
Gentlemen, time to get up.
It's getting late.
Time to make up your beds.
Just to think
that only a few weeks ago,
when I was invited
here for dinner,
Miss Rose
reproached me
for personally carrying
a lawn chair to the garden.
A few weeks ago!
Damn it.
What's that, professor?
You're swearing?
You, educator of young minds!
Last time I checked, it was young
minds who were educating me.
On my way to Pruszków,
an extremely young man,
with a death's head on his cap
was teaching me
with steel-toed boots
the art of marching in line.
A propos, professor,
it's your turn today to
pump water from the well.
Why don't you
do it for me today,
and I'll give you my share
of bread at breakfast.
Ah, that's worth considering.
Are you planning on
lounging around till noon?
Listen, young man,
we will have to turn you in.
The water tank is empty.
If you would like to wash up,
you have to refill
the tank!
One more thing:
please make sure
you clean the bathroom
when you're done.
There's again a pool of water.
That really wasn't me.
Try to preserve at least
some dignity.
She turns me into a complete schoolboy.
You keep pointing out
that I'm an educator.
Former. I'm a former educator
just as you are a former maestro,
and everything else is former,
especially our hostess,
why refuses to
acknowledge her time passed.
In any case, the water
in the tank is also former,
- let me remind you.
- But a piece of bread is not former.
I've changed my mind.
In that case, I won't wash
myself today, either.
How's that, doctor?
You're abandoning hygiene?
No, I don't regard hygiene as highly
as you do keyboard exercises.
Now I'm going to
get some fresh air.
It's so nice to hear you
play again.
Excuse me, would you mind
leaving the room for a moment?
I'd like to get dressed.
No need to be shy.
I saw you in your underpants anyway.
Get out of here.
Breakfast will be served in 20 min.
In the meantime,
you can wash up.
Miss Rose asks kindly
whether you wouldn't mind
going somewhere else
to learn to play.
She's got a migraine.
My God...
A migraine...
You're leaving without breakfast?
I'm not hungry.
Could we talk a little?
No.
I've never a pig
such as you.
Excuse me, what is it
that you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I want you to stop being such a swine!
If I get mad I may even slap you!
I haven't forgotten everything yet!
Table 3 is asking for their bill.
Coming.
Does princess need anything
else from the kitchen?
No, Felix.
Then we're done for today.
Please add another quart.
No, not another one.
It's getting late.
We must go home.
Come one, we're leaving.
- Yes, home.
- Let's go.
Miss Nika, another quart of vodka.
I must explain.
I don't stick my nose
into other people's business.
I know, but I don't want
you to think ill of me.
So, I guess you've met
to go over your Vienna plans.
See you tomorrow.
10 o'clock. On the dot.
You think it's wrong?
It's not like making
deals with the enemy.
They're like
a transportation company.
Anyway,
I haven't completely
made up my mind yet.
- Lidka...
- What about Lidka?
Lidka doesn't want to go.
She understands little
in these matters.
You see,
I think this is our last
chance to get out of here.
When they come here...
perhaps it won't be
as bad as they say, but
it's better to avoid the risk.
I must get out of here.
Escape from this country.
Start a new life
among new people,
and new problems.
I'm glad you're still here.
Something important
came up.
Miss Nika, please
pour me a shot of vodka.
I've got a headache.
I see there's something on your mind.
Please tell me about it.
You'll feel better.
Have you been in love
many times in your life?
What does it mean,
to be in love?
When you feel physical attraction,
that's not love.
Love is desiring another
person's soul.
Love, Miss Nika,
is lust.
Love is pure when
desiring someone's
physical form
brings to mind
the smell of clover
and sun-lit ground.
And those things with
the soul come only later.
Or don't come at all.
I see, here we have
a pair of cooing pigeons.
Lidka!
Watch out little cunt,
or the missionary will
turn you into such a slut
as he did me.
Stop it, Lidka, what
are you talking about?
Shut up you tart
or I'll pull your hair out.
There's no Lidka.
Only Genowefa.
- You're carrying on like a streetwalker!
- Completely wasted!
Have you gone mad?
I'm sick of all this.
I'll have to restrain you.
Let it go.
Let the countess
show off her breed.
Oh, such happiness,
the young lady
came back and
is downstairs.
Aren't you happy?
On the contrary.
I'm paralyzed with joy.
Miss, miss, he's over here.
Come in, quick.
He's paralyzed with joy.
I made an awful
mess of things yesterday.
I think you're not
going to kick me out.
I don't know where to start.
Best don't start at all.
It's not necessary.
But I have to explain
everything.
Perhaps.
But not to me.
Precisely to you.
You wanted me to
become a decent girl?
So I did.
And the fact there's
the same mess at the counts,
and countesses are worse
whores than dance girls,
that's not my fault.
- I also have to tell you...
- What?
I've always
liked you a lot.
I don't want things
to be like this between us.
I'm sorry.
What next?
I must stay with him
for the time being.
Four years.
One quarrel
won't undo it.
But he's running away.
Going to Vienna.
He won't go.
Why not?
He loves me.
I'll have to help him
unpack again.
He's probably already
chasing after me to apologize.
Good bye.
Thank you for everything.
<i>Now playing: A heart in love.</i>
He did go.
That's sad.
But under the circumstances,
he won't get far.
He'll be forced to come back.
That won't change anything.
You think?
Stop talking about Mirek.
Ok?
Ok.
