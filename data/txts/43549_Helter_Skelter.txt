A word at the start:
laughing sounds a lot like screaming.
I got my eyelashes done.
Now they really curl.
This feels so soft...
It's looks that matter, right?
Lilico's so cute!
She sure is!
Beauty Ice Bar
For more...
...than 'cute'...
...or 'pretty'...
Beauty Ice Bar
There's a sound inside me.
Tick tock tick tock,' it says.
Telling me to hurry.
The sound inside me that says
something will soon be over.
HELTER SKELTER
Lilico
The most fascinating thing
about stardom...
...is that it's a kind of deformity,
like cancer.
Sorry?
A fascinating face,
in a state of collapse.
Collapse?
Lilico?
All the high-school girls
want that face.
The skin and muscle movements
don't match the bone structure.
It looks good, but the balance is off.
It's about to collapse.
You think so?
I love morning coffee.
Jet-black darkness
dissolved in a cup.
Sweet, and transient.
Is that a poem?
Nothing.
So what about this clinic?
Tax evasion...
That was first.
Then bribery of politicians.
Now I'm interested in
traffic in baby parts...
...and drug violations.
Well...
...it's certainly convenient
to be pretty...
...but beauty...
...is different from happiness.
Pretty on the outside...
...but like a fruit
the bugs have eaten from within.
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest of them all?
Is that why she fascinates?
Because everyone knows
she'll wither?
Look this way!
Lilico, how does it feel to be
starring in your first movie?
To be honest, I'm nervous.
I can only follow the lead
of these fine actors...
...and learn from them.
Mako, how do you feel
about playing the best friend?
Yeah, uh...
Mako's just so cute!
We're best friends already.
We were just saying
how we're going to do our best, right?
What's this?!
What's going on?
Why am I in a two-shot with her?!
Hada!
Yes?
Turn the heat up.
Answer me!
Right!
Non-carbonated.
I don't like cold water.
Room temperature.
A beauty tip...
Kin-chan...
Once the face is wet...
...you apply foundation.
That's how a pro does it.
Don't forget.
Lilico!
Darling! What are you doing here?
How else do I get to see you?
You're always busy.
I wanted to see you...
Here.
When are you free?
I don't know.
Why don't you just quit?
I'm hard as a rock.
Look at me.
You're mine.
Only mine.
Ow!
I burned myself.
Don't let it get cold!
You always do.
7 a.m. tomorrow.
I've told the boss
she's working her too hard.
Shin!
Michiko! You killed me!
Bon appétit.
Is Lilico really pretty?
She's really beautiful.
But...
...she's never happy. I pity her.
She's lost without me.
Can I come?
Radish sprouts.
Want some?
Have they ever grown!
Hey...
What are you doing?
Come on.
Not now! After dinner.
Get these down.
They'll see us next door!
Turn off the lights.
Shin!
Don't forget.
Lots of close-ups of me.
I'll work hard.
OK. I'll tell the director.
He's always saying how he doesn't
make movies for little girls.
But if they don't like it,
we're screwed.
Right?
Say hello to your wife and daughter.
Give me a break!
See you.
Mama?
I did it with the producer.
Well done.
Just making sure.
You're sure I'll be OK?
Why wouldn't you be?
I won't steer you wrong.
Anyway, you start
at 7 tomorrow.
Go home.
Those marks...
They're from plastic surgery.
All that's hers...
...are her eyeballs, her ears,
her fingernails...
...and her pussy.
The rest is all fake.
Maybe she's wearing out.
I should go...
Kin-chan!
You have this.
They're rubies. 8 karats.
My late husband bought it for me.
Take good care of it.
I couldn't!
Now you know all this...
...stay with her till the end.
I'm putting Lilico's face
in your hands.
Michiko Hada, 35.
Lilico's assistant.
I know her better than anyone.
I mean, she was...
... so beautiful!
It'll be fine. We'll operate again.
Wonderful!
We are starting a revolution,
creating a new sense of values.
Mama!
I'll have to stop working again!
Don't worry! It'll be fine.
I'll take care of everything.
Lie down over there.
Don't touch me!
If you would.
This way.
Where's the doctor?!
I know you're there!
Come out here!
It's all right!
You have to fix this!
What?
It's Ms Kandagawa.
Her bill's not paid.
After I made her beautiful...
Is she so arrogant as to think
she doesn't need regular treatments?
She should get a job.
Doctor...
Just in case, could we have
something stronger...
...and quicker?
You know how?
All right.
Death always approaches
with silent footsteps.
What a waste!
She was a beautiful girl!
Megumi Otomo, 23.
Platina Clinic'...
You're working on that, right?
Transplants.
Transplants?
We're told the director and
her ex-husband, a gynaecologist...
...are illegally obtaining organs,
skin, bone, and muscle...
...and transplanting them
for cosmetic surgery.
That's creepy.
Patients need suppressant drugs
for the rest of their lives.
If they can't pay for them any more,
they suffer severe side-effects.
Why do they do it?
A woman gets nowhere
on brains alone.
Brains?
They're young and pretty enough.
Women are greedy.
Me? Kinji Sawanabe,
make-up artist and stylist.
My age? Not telling.
Lilico then?
Well...
That feels good! Yes!
Flying high!
Lift your head!
Leave 'em brain-dead!
OK, great! Great!
More! That's beautiful!
A big fake smile!
Lilico, you're beautiful! Yes!
Every magazine with her on the cover
sold out.
Sexy Venus'.
That was great!
Seven ad contracts.
TV dramas, variety shows...
Our guest today is Lilico,
whose appeal no one can resist.
Hello.
You're on the cover of just about
every fashion magazine there is...
I regard fashion and make-up
as an expression of myself.
She'd even had offers
from Hollywood.
How does it feel being voted...
...the woman that other women
most want to be?
I'm amazed. I can't believe
I was voted number one.
She was everybody's dream girl.
There was nothing she couldn't do.
Beautiful.
She was like something
out of a dream!
That's great!
Pretty!
Very nice!
Great!
Beauty Ice Bar
It's like lately
I'm too tired to sleep.
Are you OK?
It's like...
...whenever they click the shutter...
...my head empties out.
Bigger smile!
Wave the product!
Big smile! Look this way!
Beautiful!
The hair...
Kin-chan...
Stepping in.
Ready.
Here we go.
Smile...
Great!
Beautiful! You got it!
You got it!
Bigger smile.
Smile!
More!
Bigger smile!
Oh, that's great!
Great! More smile.
You got it!
I'm so tired!
Hada, what's on tomorrow?
We're due at Wangan Studio
at 7 a.m.
Then two interviews at the Hyatt.
With photographs.
Then the Kinuta movie studio
at 5.
Nothing after that.
You know, Hada...
...you've got beautiful skin.
Why don't you ever wear make-up?
Try to look pretty sometimes.
Nothing I could do
would make much difference.
And I'm old.
Have this.
Try it sometime.
But watch out.
It's like a drug.
The more you do...
...the more you want.
What's tomorrow?
My head hurts.
That was funny!
Huh?
I hear something.
Hear that?
Tick tock'...
There.
A clock?
It's over.
All over.
But that's OK.
I knew it'd happen.
Hey...
...do you have a boyfriend?
Yes.
So you do...
You've got Mr Nanbu.
No.
I wish.
But everyone loves you.
Lots of people.
Hundreds, thousands, millions...
But I've never met or talked to
any of them.
And what's there
that they can love?
If I stop being pretty...
If I stop being popular?
Then they'll all leave me.
They'll laugh.
They'll all forget me.
Never!
I was amazed...
...the first time I saw you...
...out on the terrace at the office
smoking a cigarette...
...with the window
like a picture-frame...
...your hair in the wind...
Beautiful,' I thought.
Was there ever
anyone that beautiful?'
What a laugh!
Over?
That's it?
I won't let that happen!
Do you know what it's like?!
Are you all right?
Hada...
...am I beautiful?
Yes.
Really?
Very beautiful.
You're the only one
who understands me.
Right now...
...I'm very...
...turned on.
I feel all warm down there.
I need you.
Hada...
...will you lick me?
Lilico couldn't do anything
without me.
What?
I'm sorry. There's someone
who insists on seeing you.
Ichimura...
I'm Chikako.
I want to see my sister.
Look, Kin-chan!
What?
Ta-da!
Third finger, left hand...
Let me see that!
It's twice the size of your finger!
What did it cost?
Nice, huh?
From Chikako Hirukoma
Hi, Sis. How are you?
We came to Tokyo
on our school trip.
They said not to,
but I really wanted to see you.
Of course you weren't around.
I got your boss to buy me dinner.
She wouldn't give me your address
or phone number, though.
I copied it out of her day-book
while she was away.
Not nice, huh?
Take care. I'm studying hard.
Chikako.
Hello! It's Hada.
Hello. I'm coming in.
Hello.
I brought these...
What?
Leave when you're done.
You make me sick.
Is there anything else
I can do?
Don't get all puffed up
just 'cause you licked my cunt.
Pervert!
Lilico And Nanbu Heir!
Nights Of Passion!
What's this?
Hada!
How could you let this happen?
You know your job.
I'm sorry!
I wish that helped.
I need a plan.
Don't worry. I'll handle it.
Mess up again and it's hara-kiri.
I've bet my life on this.
Answer.
Yes, ma'am!
Hada got in trouble!
Well done. Thank you
for leaking that.
I'll reward you later.
But first...
...I need another favor.
It's beautiful here!
Lilico gave me this.
Isn't it nice?
Lilico!
Here she is.
Thanks.
Sorry, Hada, but could you
leave us alone for a while?
Sure.
I'll be right over there.
What's going on?
I was up this way,
and I hadn't seen you for ages...
I saw the drama. It was great!
Oh, that...
It was hard.
They can all act.
I'm thinking of quitting.
I can't sing,
and talk shows aren't my thing.
That's pretty.
You need to think about yourself.
Lose weight, get prettier.
You'll be stronger.
Get your eyes fixed.
That takes money.
Money?
I'll send more.
I'm not as strong as you.
That's why you got beautiful.
No, Chikako.
Beauty makes you strong.
You needn't worry.
You've put up with
a lot worse than this.
Remember when you first came here.
No one took any notice of you.
As if you didn't exist.
You were just a lump of meat.
The object of our treatment
is happiness.
The old you...
...is gone, right?
By your own efforts...
...you have obtained...
...the you that you wanted.
See you in two weeks.
Unhook the monitors.
A big hand, everybody...
Lilico is here at last!
What is your beauty secret?
Her beauty is a montage of images.
The sum total of our desires.
I like yoga and pilates.
She beats her wings the way we want...
...even if she can only do that
by losing her own feathers.
Lilico's really gotten to you.
She's fascinating
when you look into it.
Helter skelter.
Total chaos.
She's our wild card.
It's about time we met.
You forgot, didn't you.
What I said.
You speak Japanese?
I'm sorry.
No looks, no brains, no money...
you poor thing!
But Lilico's still pretty as ever.
Good!
You're eating?
You eat too much. Throw it up later.
I'm beat!
Mama...
The money for my family...
Have you been sending it?
Every month.
Chikako says you haven't.
What, you don't trust me?
Maybe it's not as much
as you were thinking...
...but it costs a lot to maintain you.
And I haven't got
my investment back yet.
But still...
I'm hurt.
You were nothing when I found you,
and we've come all this way together.
Yeah, but...
I don't just think of you
as business, you know.
You're my dream,
one that I created.
Excuse me...
Hi, Kozue.
I'll introduce you.
Kozue Yoshikawa, 1 8.
I don't know why,
but everyone loves her.
We have great hopes for her.
How do you do.
And she's learned how
to introduce herself, too.
Cut! OK!
Thanks very much!
Come over here.
OK, good...
Beautiful! Just like that!
Like you're kissing the camera.
Yes!
Perfect!
Yes!
Today's guest is the latest rage,
Kozue Yoshikawa.
You're just so pretty!
And now you're breaking into TV.
Checking.
That gap's perfect.
Move in closer, Kozue.
Good. Thanks.
Thank you.
They're all Kozue.
She's so cute!
How does she do it?
She's taking over.
It's all Kozue.
She's so cute it's not fair!
Look at her skin!
I saw Kozue on the train.
What?! You saw Kozue?
I want to be her!
That'll take real magic!
Lovely!
It's that 'something'.
You're right.
The fame, the money...
I couldn't care less.
What? All the models throw up.
How else do you stay that thin?
You get those people.
They're just born that way.
They're born beautiful.
Why did she get this job?!
You were taking time off...
It could have been anybody,
right?
Why Kozue?!
Lilico! Wait!
Lilico!
Kin-chan! Go after her!
Lilico!
I'm sick of this!
I want to quit!
You don't need me, right?
You don't need me!
I'm sick of it!
I don't want to do this any more!
Silly!
There's no one
who can take your place!
You don't need me!
I don't want to do this!
All right.
Have a sleep.
It was about that time
Lilico started losing the plot.
No?
You're good-looking, you know.
Would you like to act?
No.
About this photograph...
That's me. Where did you find this?
You look exactly like Lilico.
You think so?
Well, if you say so.
Believe it or not, I used to be
not completely untalented.
So Lilico was a replica of you?
What's all this about you
getting engaged?
To a politician's daughter.
Is that true?
Well, you know...
Sorry. I meant to tell you.
You gave me a ring!
It's status.
Status'?
Come on, now.
There's no way someone like me
can marry someone like you.
Don't get me wrong.
You're the one I like most.
I'll just be married in name.
Why don't you come
on the honeymoon, too?
I'll dump her and we can...
Shin?
Hi.
There you are...
I might not be home for a while.
Buy yourself something to eat.
What's wrong?
Lilico's all messed up.
I have to take her to a hotel.
She can't do anything without me.
Nor can I.
Shin!
I'll see you.
Hey, wait a minute...
No, Shin!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?
Lilico...
Is this your boyfriend?
Yes.
How do you do.
Hello.
Hada's someone I rely on.
Good.
Your boyfriend's good-looking, Hada.
So these are the lips
that captivate Hada?
Can I...
...kiss you?
You don't mind, do you?
Oh, my!
You're hard as a rock.
What are we going to do?
How can you stand it?
I can't.
Watch, Hada.
I'm going to do something bad
with your boyfriend.
Michiko
Hello?
It's me. Lilico.
I really enjoyed last night.
Are you busy tonight?
Let's have some fun.
Great, huh?
He's coming over.
Then we're going to make you feel
really good.
So stop staying
you're going to quit, OK?
I'll be good.
I'm going to work real hard.
I love you, Hada.
I'm lost without you.
Cheri? Cheri?
OK?
I don't know.
Shin! Did you do it?
I don't know! I don't know!
This is bad. Real bad!
It's in the papers.
Acid Thrown in
Politician's Daughter's Face
You've done it now.
I could get you sent to jail.
Maybe I will.
You told us to do it!
I've never met the woman.
I just said it'd be funny
if you did something like that.
I never dreamed you would.
You're finished if it comes out.
What a laugh!
I'm just kidding.
You did a great job.
Thanks.
I love you both.
But this has to be our secret.
The three of us.
OK?
Here's your reward...
Take your clothes off.
Hurry it up!
You're going to do it
in front of me.
Useless!
Why don't you fall apart?!
Sink down as far as I have.
Ayako Kandagawa, 27.
A patient at that clinic.
Any note?
In her bag we found her wallet,
cell phone, and a daily planner...
...with 'no further'
scrawled the day before.
Two dead.
This has gone too far.
What now? We don't have enough
to lay a charge.
It's about time we turned over
our card.
I want to see you.
Hello?
Lilico, please.
Coming.
Off you go.
Does everyone know?
Not everyone.
But the blemishes won't go away.
Blemishes?
Her skin...
It's like she's old.
No elasticity.
It won't bounce back.
Kana asked if she had a disease.
We work with our fingertips.
We can tell.
This might be the end for her.
You're as pretty as ever.
I'm glad you changed your mind.
You sweet-talked me.
How's your fiancée, anyway?
Is she in any shape for a wedding?
Forget that woman.
The only one I love is you.
Do you think of me
when you're doing it with her?
No. I think of you
and I jerk off a lot.
Then why marry her?
It's work,
is how I think of it.
It was set when I was born
the eldest son.
I wanted to be a sailor.
And a musician.
And an entomologist.
But I couldn't.
Why didn't you?
I couldn't.
Sure you could.
No way.
All you had to do was try.
Instead you gave up without trying
and now you feel sorry for yourself.
Life is what you decide it is.
It's true. The one who decides
is you.
The doctor says
she's too busy to talk to us.
And upstairs won't issue a warrant
so we can subpoena her.
You know who her patients are?
They're not all actors and models.
They're mostly the children of
businessmen and politicians.
Thus the iron curtain
protecting them?
And the doctor thinks
she can tell us to get lost.
But we have a trump card.
Let's go see...
...the ferocious Princess Tiger Lily.
And cut!
30 minutes for set change.
Back at 2!
We meet at last, Tiger Lily.
I'm a fan.
Prosecutor'?
Tiger Lily'? What do you mean?
Don't make up names for me.
A beautiful adventuress.
You are definitely Tiger Lily.
Mister...
...what would you know about me?
I'm here to ask you to be
a witness in court.
About what?
The beauty clinic you use.
I'm sure you're aware
what they do is illegal?
Beauty...
They take advantage of
women obsessing over it.
They do evil things.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sorry, I'm not very bright.
You don't seem to be
a very good liar.
Can you tell what the lie is?
Yes. I understand you.
You're scattering feathers,
trying to please everyone.
I know that desire of yours
better than anyone.
I'm sorry we had to meet
in these circumstances.
If not 'Tiger Lily', how about...
...'Ms Hirukoma'?
When I saw your old pictures
I thought of 'Tiger Lily's Adventure'.
You're in the middle of it now.
It took courage to leave a small town
and make it this far.
Courage is beautiful.
You'll be fine.
You're beautiful.
Stop it!
But you shouldn't have used
your own van.
Van?
What did you have Michiko Hada
and Shin Okamura do ten days ago?
Meaning?
There was a van parked nearby.
We have its license number.
And a witness, I'm afraid.
I've never been to any clinic,
and I have nothing to do with one.
Hada's my assistant, that's all.
I've never met that guy.
This is crazy!
All right.
Let's leave it at that for today.
But we need your testimony.
You are Ariadne's ball of thread.
This is what makes us suspicious
of that clinic.
Look at it.
So that no more women
fall into the same deep pit.
Excuse me.
A deep pit...
I'm already in one.
Lilico? The pot-au-feu's ready.
Beauty Ice Bar
For more...
...than 'cute'...
...or 'pretty'...
Beauty Ice Bar
Hada...
Hada?
Hada!
Yes?
Hada...do you love me?
Then destroy her face.
Carve it wide open.
She makes me sick.
Good!
Break for lunch!
Thank you.
Today we have two amazing guests...
...Lilico, and Anna Ishibashi!
Hello.
Now I'm into making macaroons.
Macaroni?
No!
I always get them mixed up.
Today is...
...Lilico's birthday!
And here comes the birthday cake!
Happy birthday!
I don't care. Do it.
Call someone! Anyone!
We'll be forgotten. We're machines
for the processing of desires.
Pretty!' 'Wow!'
That's what I want to be!'
Desire doesn't care.
It just keeps on with another name
and another face.
More beautiful...
More...
You're used up.
Are you OK? Lilico?
My head hurts!
Where's my cell?
Hello, Lilico? Are you OK?
Like I was saying,
why don't you take some time off?
Hello?
I feel responsible...
Lilico? Lilico?
Are you OK?
Kozue...
You couldn't do it, right?
What good are you, anyway?!
What happens to me now?
I won't get any work!
They'll all forget me!
You'll all go away.
Being forgotten...that's like dying!
I'm going to die!
You're not going to die!
Oh, shut up!
It'll be OK!
You'll be fine.
I'll be here with you.
How would you know
how it feels?!
Let go of me!
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest of them all?
Hello! I'm from Nice Post...
Lilico, I'm from Wake Up magazine...
We've received
a very surprising letter.
Is it true you've had
full-body cosmetic surgery?
Did you work in the sex trade?
Did you know that clinic
was breaking the law?
Give us a statement!
You're there, aren't you.
Could we have a comment...
It's like...
...I'm going to
make them all happy again.
Can you believe this?!
Uh-oh...
Surgery!
Wow!
She's a fake!
Incredible!
I feel cheated!
Perfect style', and it's all fake!
This is bad!
This is big!
No way!
She was a fat little hooker!
Oh, yuck!
What a pig!
From a pig barn!
Pure pork!
That's the end of Lilico, right?
Anyone could do that!
Eat that, will you?
Lilico! Lilico! Lilico!
That clinic Lilico went to
looks pretty sleazy.
Baby parts...
Placentas!
That's how she got like this?
This I want to know!
What did Lilico get?
Search.
Where's your cell?
Check it out on your cell.
This is serious!
I know, sir.
Our information was leaked,
and it's started a media frenzy.
I was in charge.
I will take responsibility.
You are suspended from duty
till further notice.
I understand.
Did you leak that?
Turning over your card?
The law is just rules people work out.
With emotional questions of good,
or bad...
...only the brave adventurer
rises above it.
And it's always at a crossroads.
We're at a crossroads?
From now on
we're up against the powerful.
It'll be a long war.
And...
...you can only play
your wild card once.
You played your trump.
With regret.
It was the best job of my life.
I got my lawyer
to write you a script.
The writer's changed it
to sound like you.
Memorize every word of it,
and don't say anything else.
Mama...
...have I made you money?
Or not?
I'm way in the red!
My models are quitting,
our bookings are cancelled...
But I'll take responsibility.
I created you, after all.
Mama...
Yes?
Excuse me!
Kin-chan...
...cover up those marks.
Please.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I practically need
special-effects make-up.
Yeah?
Then I could work
with Michael Jackson.
He's dead.
But you're alive.
My head hurts.
You OK?
Have some water.
I'm glad I worked with her.
She was my pride and joy.
There.
You can't live without me.
Hi, Tiger Lily.
You're doing it?
Sure.
I'm going to carry this off.
I'll show them what they want.
There's no need
to harm your feathers any more.
Your service to everyone
will be wasted.
In 1 5 minutes they'll forget.
They have their own concerns.
That's right.
There's no one who loves me.
No one who needs me.
So I decide, and I destroy myself.
Thank you for taking time
from your busy schedules today.
Lilico, a model who works
through our agency...
...will make a sincere statement
of her feelings...
...concerning certain recent reports.
I beg your indulgence
in hearing her.
Lilico, you can start.
I have nothing to say
about that woman.
Lilico!
She was over.
She was desperate.
It was incredible!
Then it was, like, 'uh-oh...'
How is anyone that driven?
I mentored her...
Well...
...things happen.
I loved that girl.
Did you hear?
They say there was no Lilico.
What?!
It was like CG.
She died...I mean, she was dead.
Then she came back.
Put her picture on your cell phone
and your eyes get bigger.
I put her picture under my pillow
when I went to sleep.
It cured my pimples!
Putting Lilico on your cell phone
is a bit much.
Yeah...
She had surgery.
What if you wake up
and your face is gone?
Could I lose weight and then wake up
and be like her?
She's cute!
Where's that from?
A used-clothing place.
Mr Asada!
It's me!
A lot of things
happened back then...
...but I always wanted to see you.
Reina!
Coming!
This is where I am...
...right now.
Come and see me if you like.
Sorry!
Who was that?
Lilico's sister.
Chikako Hirukoma?
Little Tiger Lily.
Today's our 1 6th hearing.
It's not over.
1 56 patients have filed suit
against the clinic.
There've been nine suicides,
and at least one missing.
Lilico...
Little Tiger Lilies everywhere.
Young, glittering...
But everyone knows
one day it has to end.
Why do the gods give us
youth and beauty...
...then take them away?
They're not the same.
Youth is beautiful,
but beauty isn't youth.
It's more complicated,
packed full of other things.
But Lilico...
Was a success.
See? She's smiling.
The Legend of Lilico'
Now on Sale!
Tiger Lily...
Your adventure goes on...forever.
Let's move.
Yeah, that was great!
Fits right in with the neon!
Great, Kozue!
Just like that! Yes!
Last one.
OK! Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Kin-chan, thanks.
You were great, Kozue!
Party! Champagne!
Yeah!
I hear we're going to
a very interesting club.
Yeah?
With a bad show.
Here.
Thank you!
Good job!
Cheers!
