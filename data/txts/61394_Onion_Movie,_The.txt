you will receive
upon your discharge... this.
- A hot bitch poster.
- Damn it! Sign me up!
The Internet went down
for three hours this morning...
plunging the nation into productivity.
The outage, which caused major work
"startages" from New York to California...

<i>More Onion News after this.</i>
In a world without justice...

<i>One man must face
the ultimate challenge-</i>
Master, how did they defeat me?
They used an ancient technique.
It strikes at the very core of a warrior's strength.
<i>For this attack,
there is no defense.</i>
Master, will you teach me?
- You are not yet ready, my son.
- I'm ready, master.
<i>No, you are not.
You have much to learn.</i>
<i>You, young pupil...</i>

<i>From Global Tetrahedron Pictures-</i>
<i>Steven Seagal is Cockpuncher.</i>
Stop!
<i>Cockpuncher.</i>
I don't think you have the balls.
<i>From Global Tetrahedron Pictures.</i>
That looks awesome!
Sure does, kids.
A real whomp in the nut sack.
<i>Honey, have you seen
my good black socks?</i>
<i>- Mommy, look.
- Honey?</i>
<i>If you see news happening,
call the Onion News hotline.</i>
<i>Honey, I cannot find my good black socks.</i>
<i>Hello? Onion News?</i>
<i>My baby!</i>
We're here live with
a breaking news story.
Apparently, a local area man
has misplaced his black socks.
Mr. McCormick, would you please tell us
exactly what happened this morning?
Sure. Um, I got up.
It was a normal morning.
The kids are downstairs.
And, uh, my wife's giving 'em breakfast.
And all of a sudden, I noticed
that my good black socks are missing.
Here's your boy, ma'am,
safe and sound.
Oh. Thanks, thanks.
Look, sweetie. Look!
<i>- The Onion News van!
- Yeah.</i>
In other news, a local
eight-year-old accidentally...
exercised his Second Amendment
rights yesterday...
when he blew off his head
with his father's semiautomatic rifle.
The fatal incident is being hailed
by gun rights activists...
as a victory for America
and the Constitution.
- Nobody move, unless you want
your head blown off!
- You!
- Please. Please don't shoot me.
I'll give you however much you want.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think I want money?
You think that's what this is about?
A big, angry black man
comes walking in waving a gun...
and you assume
he's robbing the place?
I ain't looking for no goddamn handout.
I'm looking for a motherfucking job, bitch!
- Excuse me?
- You heard me! A motherfucking job!
<i>Don't you see? If you give me money,
that'll just help me in the short term.</i>
But a job, that'll help me develop
valuable job skills and experience.
It's like teaching a man how to fish.
So quit stalling,
get your bitch ass back there...
and give me a 40-hour week position...
with vacation pay and benefits...
you piece of shit motherfucker.
And don't make me ask twice.
Back that ass up.
<i>Let's go. Let's go. I can help
the next motherfuckin' person in line.</i>
<i>You in that apricot sweater suit,
get your bitch ass on over here now!</i>
How can I help you today?
I'd like to deposit this check,
please, into my savings account,
and then I need to withdraw-
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just shut the fuck up for a minute.
What the fuck you doin', Liz Anne?
You callin' the cops?
- No.
- If that's the goddamned cops-
No, no, I swear. I was just on
with an account holder. I was advising him-
I'm gonna kill you, bitch!
Who the fuck's this?
You a cop? Mm-hmm.
<i>Well, what I recommend is that
you keep at least 500 in your checking...</i>
to just avoid
the minimum balance fee...
and put the rest in our money market which
will earn you an additional 2% interest.
<i>Right. You have a nice day, sir.
My pleasure. Uh-</i>
Liz Anne, uh, sorry.
My bad.
That's okay.
Honest mistake.
Armed gunman,
I've been watching you...
and I must say, I'm impressed.
How'd you like to be
our new customer services supervisor?
<i>Mr. P., it'd be
my motherfuckin' honor.</i>
Outstanding. Yeah, we're gonna get you
an annuity for 12 years on that one.
I'll get you 8% on that one.
Everybody down now!
Get the fuck down, everybody!
Give me all the money!
Hurry up! Hurry the fuck up!
<i>What you doing?
You playing back there?</i>
Load the bag up with money,
and nobody else fucking move.
You hurry up!
Hurry the fuck up!
Load the bag up!
Load the bag-
You sicken me.
Asking for a handout...
instead of raising yourself up
out of your situation through hard work.
Why don't you get a job like the rest of us?
According to statistics,
87% of U.S. citizens are obese.
And the surgeon general is taking steps
to address the problem.
<i>- As a result of the rampant
spread of obesity in the U. S...</i>
the government has been forced
to raise the definition of obesity...
from 55% body fat to 90%.
<i>The move, which reduces
the number of obese Americans...</i>
<i>from 200 million to 185 million...</i>
was widely applauded
from coast to coast.
It's high time the government stepped in
and did something about this problem.
I don't wanna be obese.
Man, that shit is all fucked up.
In other news,
Georgia officials announced...
<i>plans to add a swastika and middle finger
to the Georgia state flag.</i>
Joe's Diner,
an unusual Atlanta area eatery...
was not based around any sports,
music, or movie-based theme-
<i>- Have you spoken to Norm about the changes?
- Not yet.</i>
<i>- He's not gonna be happy.
- But he's got no choice.</i>
Whatever the new parent
company says... goes.
Melissa Cherry is America's
biggest pop sensation...
selling millions of records
to her legions of teenage fans.
But is this young singer
sending the wrong message?
Kip Kendall reports.
<i>Her new album, Come With Me...</i>
<i>has gone quadruple platinum
and made her a household name.</i>
# Baby, when we kiss
my heart just skips a beat #
#And when you hold my hand
Oh, I can hardly speak #
# Oh, yeah
I'm down on my knees #
<i>But some concerned parents
think Melissa Cherry's...</i>
<i>image and music are too sexy...</i>
setting an inappropriate
example for their children.
So, what do you say to
all the concerned parents out there?
Well, Kip, I honestly don't understand
what all the fuss is about.
My music isn't about sex.
<i>It's about being a girl
and having fun.</i>
But clearly the song, "Down on my Knees,"
Melissa, is about fellatio, isn't it?
Ew. It's about how...
like, when you have
a big crush on a boy...
<i>sometimes you get down on your knees
and, like, beg for their love.</i>
# Oh, I got so much love
I need to show it #
What about your first big hit,
"Take Me From Behind"?
"Take Me From Behind"
isn't sexual at all.
It's about love sneaking up on you.
You know, like from the behind.
<i>You know, it could be a boyfriend's love
sneaking up on you...</i>
or a friend's or even Jesus Christ.
# But what I really want is for
you to take me from behind #
# Oh, yeah #
# Oh, yeah #
# Oh #
# Oh, oh #
#When you love me right up front
you know that I don't mind #
# But what I really want is for you
to take me from behind #
Let's talk about the song,
"Lollipop Love."
"Lollipop Love" is...
the kind of love
that is just really sweet...
and you just kind of want to lick it,
you know, and suck it.
# Lollipop
Hey, yeah #
# Lollipop #
# Love #
# Lollipop #
<i># Love
Baby, baby #</i>
# Lolly, lolly, lolly
lollipop #
<i># Oh-ho, lollipop love #</i>
Like a lollipop.
What about the song
"Shoot Your Love All Over Me"?
<i>That's about how, like,
when you're in love...</i>
you just wanna be covered in it.
# Shoot your love all over me #
# Oh, drown me in a milky sea #
<i># Love all over me #</i>
But clearly, the video
seems to tell a different story.
What kind is that?
<i>- The kind with a... cum shot.
- I'm a virgin.</i>
How would I know what a facial is?
<i>Sometimes I like dressing up
sexy in my videos...</i>
but that's just my way
of celebrating being a woman.
<i>You know, people are always
gonna try to tear you down...</i>
<i>but that's their problem, not mine.</i>
<i>Because I know
who Melissa Cherry is.</i>
<i>She's just a good, old-fashioned country girl
from Monroe, Tennessee.</i>

he is pretty fucking cute.
Hi, Norm.
Who's the best anchorman
in the whole world? You are!
Come on, Norman.
You've gotta get with the times, mate.
These kind of tie-ins are
commonplace these days, Norman.
It's called synergy, Norm.
We cannot have a shameless ad
for our parent company...
running during the newscast.
<i>It's a blatant compromise
of our journalistic ethics and integrity.</i>
I'm sorry. It's just that, um-
You know, what you're saying, it's-
It's a steaming pile of shit, mate.
<i>Norm, listen, what he's trying
to say is it's, uh, uh-</i>

It's rude, crude and uncensored.</i>

<i>- Welcome to
Focus on Film with Kenneth Garber.</i>
<i>Hello. We are now a good
way through the film...</i>
so we thought it would be a good time
to get some perspective on it.
And joining us to provide just that...
<i>are Nicholas Van Essen
and Raymond Marcus.</i>
<i>Offer us, if you will, your take on
how the film is doing thus far.</i>
I'll have to say, Kenneth,
that I am very impressed.
Sketch after sketch,
we're being treated to...
a brilliantly biting skewering
of contemporary social mores.
Well, Raymond, what do you think?
<i>- I must strenuously disagree.
- Ah.</i>
This is nothing but vulgar, low-brow,
potty humor thinly disguised as satire.
<i>It saddens me that the Onion has stooped
to this lowest common denominator...</i>
pandering to the masses.
Well, now for a third opinion...
let's go straight to the source.
We have with us here
in the studio a very special guest.
Welcome, Masses.
So, what do you think of the film?
It's pretty cool so far, I guess.
That Cockpuncher dude is awesome.
Bam! Right in the balls.
<i>But this part, with these film-expert assholes-</i>
<i>I mean, why do you even have these two
gaywads in the movie for anyways?</i>
Fags!
Lose 'em and let's get on
with the movie, dude.
<i>Gentlemen, experience the majestic splendor...</i>
<i>of a cruise aboard the luxurious
Queen Nathan II.</i>
<i>On the Queen Nathan, there's so much
for today's gay man to enjoy-</i>
<i>shuffleboard, exquisite cuisine...</i>
<i>monster cocks.</i>
<i>Grab a pole and go deep-sea fishing.</i>
<i>Work those muscles
in our shipboard gym.</i>
<i>Enjoy our world-class spa.</i>
<i>Or take a thrilling
Las Vegas-style revue.</i>
<i>Yes, whether you want
to scuba dive, get blown...</i>
<i>or play blackjack

<i>the Queen Nathan II's

<i>So climb aboard the Queen Nathan II.</i>
<i>And now it's time
for Little-Known Racial Stereotypes.</i>
<i>Yes, everyone knows that
Italians are all mobsters...</i>
<i>and Native Americans are all drunks.</i>
<i>But did you know
that blacks love taffy?</i>
<i>It's also true that Eskimos
run all the locksmith shops...</i>
<i>the Irish have enormous nipples...</i>
<i>and Puerto Ricans can dangle
from steel beams for hours at a time.</i>
<i>Damn, that's unbelievable.</i>
- How does he do that?
- Oh, he's a Puerto Rican.
<i>- Also...
- Y'ello?</i>
<i>did you know that the Dutch
enjoy speaking with telemarketers?</i>
Visa? With a special
credit card offer?
<i>Peruvians love to swoop in

<i>And they can shoot laser beams

<i>And, of course,
all Arabs are terrorists.</i>
<i>Ah, stereotypes. Can you imagine

Okay, that must be our final player.
- Hi, Julie!
- Hi.
- Welcome.
- Oh, your house is so lovely.
Oh, thank you!
Come on in.
- Everybody, this is Julie.
- Hi.
- Pretty cute, huh?
- Hi, Julie.
Have a seat. So, I understand this
is your first whodunit party?
Ah, you are gonna
have so much fun! Okay!
With any luck, by the end of the night
we'll figure out which one of us did the dirty deed.
<i>Any one of us could be the rapist!</i>
- I'm sorry. Did you say "rapist?"
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Don't these things usually
revolve around, um, a murder?
<i>Yeah, Julie, see,
we do this every few months...</i>
and frankly, we were getting
a little bored with murder.
So I was like, " Isn't there some other
violent crime we can reenact?"
And I'm in the store the other day...
and I find this.
How fantastic is that?
So, anyway, Julie,
since you are new, luckyJulie...
you get to be the victim.
<i>Okay?</i>
- Ooh.
- So, I want you to put this on. Hop up.
Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.
The lights are gonna go out.
So, you lie down on the floor.
We're all gonna come running in, but you're
gonna be unconscious, so you stay down there.
Don't you think this is a little... sick?
Oh, sweetie, it's all in fun.
No one's actually raping anyone.
I mean, you wouldn't have a problem with
a murder-mystery game now, would you?
- I guess not.
- Yeah, so why would you object to a game...
revolving around a lesser crime
where no one even loses their life?
- Well, it's just different.
- Oh, "it's just, it's just"!
Come on, guys.
Let's play the game.
Get your cards. Okay?
CD in here.
You got that on, sweetie?
Okay, get down on the floor.
Get down on the floor.
Ready for a rapin'?
Oh, no, please don't rape me.
- Shut up, you bitch!
- No, no, please, Mr. Raper Man.
- Shut the fuck up!
- What are you doing?
Shut up, bitch!
- Oh, no!
- Shut up!
Wow.
" Oh, no. The sweet, innocent,
young daughter of Mayor Lewis has been raped.
Lock the door. No one is leaving
until we figure out who did it."
- Nice accent.
- Thanks, man.
<i>Who committed this rape? Hmm?</i>
Was it... the creepy uncle?
The handsome, young Ivy League
fraternity brother...
who's used to getting what
and who he wants?
Um, the prisoner
just released on parole? That's me.
Or the vaguely hermaphroditic
night nurse...
from the senior center
just down the block?
<i>Ooh, he's so creepy!
Okay, come on. Let's play! Let's play!</i>
"I was with my wife.
"Besides, that bitch has been
making up stories since she was four.
You can't believe anything she says!"
"I have 22 fraternity brothers
who will vouch that I was with them."
Oh, I bet you do.
Okay, time to spin.
Whoa, Julie, I know this
is your first time...
- but you're not acting very raped.
- Okay.
Oh, no, no, Julie, you can't stand up.
You've just been raped.
The rapist shattered
your pelvis with a baseball bat.
Um, I'm leaving.
Wha-What?
Where are you going?
Ju- Come-Julie, wh-
Now what?
I guess you guys are just gonna have to rape me.
<i>Oh, no, please don't rape me.</i>
Taffy?

6000s? Throw 'em in the fucking

Mr. Bates, you have a visitor.
- Hang on. Come in.
Hi.
Bates was 42.
In other news, after a six-month
stint at the Betty King Clinic...
actor Bryce Brand
finally returned home today.
That's right, Norm. I'm here outside superstar
Bryce Brand's Hollywood Hills mansion...
where, at any moment, he's due to return
from his stay at the Betty King Clinic.
<i>Bryce!</i>
Bobby, baby!
- Bryce.
- Bobby, baby!
Bobby, baby!
- I'm back!
- You look great.
I cannot tell you how good I feel
now that I'm off the drugs...
and high on life.
<i>Hey, that's what they're saying.</i>
<i>Oh, man, was I a mess.</i>
<i>But all that's changed now
that I'm clean and sober.</i>
You know, I never knew how amazing
life can be without the haze of drugs.
It's just the little things, like...
smelling the flowers-
<i>Or watching the sunset,
or just walking along the beach.</i>
You know, these things get me
way higher than drugs ever could.
<i>That's great, um, Bryce.</i>
So, we have got a lot of
catching up to do with your career.
<i>Now I brought a script. It is fantastic.</i>
Actually, your part is comedic.
Uh, sort of a wise-cracking-
Bob, this chamomile is so amazing.
It is blowing my mind, man.
Smell this.
No. Thank you, though.
Um, back to the script.
Again, it took a lot to get this-
Bob, one thing sobriety
has taught me...
is that you have to take time out
to enjoy life's little pleasures.
Can you put the tea down for a sec?
- Bryce?
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Bryce.
- Oh, my God.</i>
The nation's rapidly growing
prison population...
which recently passed
the 20 million mark...
has created
a severe overcrowding problem.
<i>In an attempt to alleviate
the overcrowding...</i>
<i>the government announced today
that a random selection of U.S. households...</i>
<i>will be asked to take prisoners
into their homes.</i>
Hi. Uh, I'm Dick.
This-This is my wife, Sarah.
This is our daughter, Allie.
And this is our son, Bobby. He's 10.
Welcome to our home.
'Sup.
Don't drop this shit on me, bitch!
What the fuck are you doing? Don't just
stand there! Get your man something to drink!
Damn, it's good to see some women.
Mm-mm-mm.
Mr. Prisoner, my tattoo hurts.
Lights out, guys.
If successful,
another 20,000 prisoners...
will be moved to suburban homes
by the first of next month.
<i>Hello and welcome once again
to Focus on Film.</i>
I'm Kenneth Garber.
And I'm joined by Kwame Roberts...
<i>president of the National Coalition
of African Americans...</i>
and James Nakatami, director of
the Asian American Alliance for Equality.
Mr. Roberts, let's start with you.
Your organization is not pleased with
this film's depiction of African Americans.
Oh, that is absolutely correct, Kenneth.
We are just about halfway
through the film...
and we've yet to see a dignified
portrayal of a person of color.
So far, we've only been shown
as vicious criminals or sex fiends.
Just take a look at that last sketch.
So, what specifically
is your group demanding?
The filmmakers put a positive black role model
on that screen in the next 10 minutes...
<i>or we will be organizing a nationwide
walkout of black moviegoers.</i>
That means every single African American
currently watching this film...
will exit the theater.
<i>Mr. Nakatami,
you are equally unhappy?</i>
<i>Thus far, there are maybe one...</i>
<i>or, at the most, two,
three Asian faces in the film.</i>
How do you feel about such
gross underrepresentation?
Me no "rikey."
Excuse me?
Me no "rikey."
And... back to the film.
In legal news, local
18-year-old Joey Frankel...
is suing for the right to be

Frankel, an employee

either verbal or physical.

Okay.
- Oh, there goes Norm again.
- He looks pissed.
Onion tip line.
What do you got?
- All right. Listen to me.
- Hi, Norm.
Our job isn't to advertise our parent company's
movie via goddamn penguin.
<i>Our job is to deliver
to the American people...</i>
<i>fair, balanced, hard-hitting news.</i>
<i>In this crazy world, the Onion may be
the only news source that people can truly trust.</i>
<i>Look, don't be so naive, Norm.
This is a business.</i>
Listen, Norm. I know you're not
gonna want to hear this.
But the suits at
Global Tetrahedron...
want you to open up Friday's broadcast
with a slightly different lead story.
But Friday is the day
Azmenistan gave Sloravia...
as a deadline for pulling out
of the Uzbagiyak region.
<i>It's also the day that
Cockpuncher opens.</i>
I mean, this Azmenistani, uh, sloppy
ground thing is all well and good, right?
But it's a million miles away.
Nobody gives a fuck about it.
<i>The more important news story
right now is Cockpuncher mania.</i>
It's sweeping the nation.
And it better sweep
your newscast Friday.
Take a putt?
No?
You owe me a pound,
you son of a bitch. I made that last one.
<i>From Global Tetrahedron Pictures...</i>
- Steven Seagal is-
- Awesome!
Goddamn whorish corporate plugs.
I'm a newsman, damn it.
<i>Oh!</i>
<i>- Cockpuncher.
- I don't think you have the balls.</i>
Oh, I cannot wait for Friday.
- Excuse me, sir.
- What can I get you?
No, thank you. I don't drink,
or use drugs for that matter.
No. I was just wondering if you could
give me directions to the local library.
Um, two blocks down
and left on Second.
Thank you very much.
You have a wonderful evening.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
You have a wonderful evening.

I have a third-level elven cleric
I can't wait to pit against my foes.
Well, uh, don't count on it being too awesome.
Look who just showed up.
<i>Well, what have we stumbled upon here?</i>
Oh, shit.
Dare you challenge the might
of Proteus the Invincible?
Ah, I see there are some beardless saplings
with us this afternoon...
who have ne'er tasted my blade.
This douche bag ruins everything.
Prepare for total devastation.
<i>The magical wizardry,

of all pretenders to the throne.
Okay, Lyle.
How's about letting some of
the younger guys have a chance today?
Okay?
When it comes to Wizards and Warbeasts,
I expect no quarter.
And none shall be given.
All right.
Now that I have readied my provisions
for the day's foray into the fairy realms...
let the slaughter begin.
None remain standing before me.
All have fallen before
the might of my broadsword.
Hope you're happy, Lyle. You just ruined
another Saturday for the whole gaming club.
What care I for
the sniveling excuses of the weak?
They shall bow before my wrath.
In the realm of fantasy, only the strong
shall survive to conquer another day.
Whatever.
Alas, the day's adventuring
is now done...
and I must take
the number two bus back home.
If only I could live in
the world of fantasy forever...
instead of being forced to
put up with this banal realm...
and its silly, weak-minded mortals.
Oh, how I wish I could live in
the realm of Wizards and Warbeasts...
ruling the land as
a mighty conqueror...
smiting orcs and ogres alike
with my trusty broadsword.
<i>Proteus the Invincible?</i>
<i>- I have heard your plea.
- What?</i>
<i>- Who-Who goes there?
- It is I, Gygax, demon of the Astral plane.</i>
<i>Never before have I seen your equal

What's going on? Guys?

God. Where am I?
Ow!
<i>Oh, God. Where am I?</i>
<i>Proteus.</i>

No, no, no.
No. No. No. No. Please.

It's now time for our weekly
Inspirational Portrait.
<i>This week, the Brendan Laroux story.</i>
<i>Brendan Laroux's story is one of dreams.</i>
<i>As a young boy,
he wanted to become a dancer...</i>
<i>but at the age of 12,
he lost his legs.</i>
<i>Now, this would be a setback
for any youngster...</i>
<i>but not Brendan, who set
his eyes on being a surgeon...</i>
<i>until, at age 14,
he lost his wrists.</i>
<i>Without my wrists, there was nothing
to keep my hands attached to my arms.</i>
So, even though my hands were fine,
l- I lost them too.
Now, Brendan may not have had as many
hands and legs as the other boys...
<i>but there was one dream
he didn't let go of-</i>
<i>becoming a professional
hockey player.</i>
<i>At first, the other players
treated him fairly.</i>
<i>But after seeing all the attention that
Brendan was getting, they became jealous.</i>
<i>The special treatment stopped. Brendan
toughed it out in the minors for two brutal years.</i>
<i>But it all paid off when
he finally got the call.</i>
<i>The coach said,
"How would you like to be pro hockey's...</i>
first legless, handless player?"
<i>It was an inspiring night, full of inspiration.</i>
<i>But then, two days later...</i>
<i>Brendan found out that
his rib cage was backwards...</i>
<i>leaving his spine exposed, and that
he needed a complete muscle transplant.</i>
<i>The risky surgery lasted 720 hours.</i>
<i>Brendan came back better than ever.</i>
<i>Brendan persevered
and was selected M. V.P.</i>
<i>Just when it seemed like the dark clouds
had finally passed, Brendan contracted scurvy...</i>
<i>went bankrupt,
and his wife was eaten by wolves.</i>
<i>He was also molested
by his Uncle Jerry.</i>
<i>Today, Brendan's journey
has opened the door for many athletes...</i>
<i>who never would have
been given a chance...</i>
<i>if he hadn't broken down
pro sports' physical ability barrier.</i>
Athletes like Emma Heathcoat,
cerebral-palsy sufferer...
<i>and three-time national
equestrian champ.</i>
<i>Blind stockcar driver,
Bobby Templeton.</i>
<i>Deaf Olympic sprinter Craig Connors.</i>
<i>Gil Sarinen, the world's first
professional comatose diver...</i>
<i>and, of course, Chicago
shooting guard Herbie Cohn...</i>
<i>who was born with Judaism.</i>
<i>Yes, none of it would have
been possible without Brendan Laroux...</i>
<i>a true Inspirational Portrait.</i>

<i>- As the conflict between Sloravia
and Azmenistan deepens...</i>
college campuses across this country
have become a hotbed of political activity.
We're here in Santa Cruz, California today.
Let's listen in.
Stop the violence.
Stop the violence!
<i>Increase the peace!</i>
For the past three years,
Sloravia and Azmenistan...
they've been locked in
a pointless and bloody war.
Their cowardly leaders send
innocent young men into battle to die.
Well, you know what?
We need to put those leaders
in a room and let them fight it out!
And you know what else? What these countries
need to do, what they need to do-
<i>- Th-They need to listen to
their women a little more.</i>
Because women create life,
while men, they destroy it.
<i>So, let's all stand up against
the corporate war machine...</i>
that only exists to do
the imperialist agenda...
against the- the oppressed minority.
Right?
Love your brother! Peace! One love.
<i>- Excuse me, Chad.
- 'Sup?</i>
We're with the U.N.
And let me just say, we are very impressed.
What you said up there
was dead on, Chad. Dead on.
What?
We want you to negotiate talks
between Sloravia and Azmenistan.
Shut up, dude.
We're convinced you are the man who can
finally bring peace to this troubled region.
Will you do it, Chad?
Will you help us increase the peace?
- Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah, dude. I'm in!
- Great.
- Would you come with me, please?
- Yeah.
<i>Your systematic campaign of aggression...</i>
against my country is the reason-
Our military operations are purely
in response to your violation of the treaty.
<i>- You are the one to violate the peace treaty!
- We?</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.
Guys, chill, chill.
Let's take a chill pill here.
Don't you guys realize that war, no matter
how justified it may seem, it's not the answer.
It's not?
No, man.
Love is the answer.
Now, let's get
this peace shit started.

- If it's not our lead story,
consider it my resignation.
<i>Cockpuncher mania.</i>
Two minutes, Norm.
<i>And now, the Onion News,
America's finest news source.</i>
Honey, it's about to start.
<i>Featuring Dana Dobbs...</i>
<i>senior correspondent, Kip Kendall...</i>
- and award-winning anchor, Norm Archer.
- Good evening.
For the past 27 years,
I've sat at this desk...
dedicating myself to one thing-
delivering the news to you,
the American viewing public...
in the most fair, balanced,
serious way possible.
What's he doing?
Well, things are changing
in the news game...
and I've been under pressure
to change with them.
<i>The powers that be at this network
have done everything they can...</i>
to get me to compromise my values.
So what do they want me to do?
Plug our parent company's movies...
and other products like
a two-bit network news whore.
Motherfucker.
Well, I've been giving this
whole ugly business a lot of thought...
and just a few moments
before going on the air tonight...
I finally came to a conclusion.
And that conclusion is-
<i>Nobody move
or the anchor infidel dies!</i>
The Al-Q'Utaya
terrorist organization...
<i>officially declares war
on the decadent, immoral...</i>
United States of Satan.
We shit on your country!
And piss also!
That was good.
Tonight, on live television...
<i>the American people will watch
this great spreader of Western lies...</i>
get blown to pieces...
unless the United States government
formally apologizes...
for its rotting, immoral culture.
Like that's gonna happen.
Are you listening, Mr. President?
- We might be fucked, sir.
- We will do it.
We will kill him right here
if you do not meet our demands!
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
I don't think you have the balls.
Cockpuncher!
Ahmed, it is the mighty
puncher of cocks.
<i>I'm hungry.</i>
I could sure go for a sundae
topped with... crushed nuts.
Yummy.
Cockpuncher!
Fuck him up!
Come on!
I believe you'll be
releasing Norm now.
Not so fast, Cockpuncher.
Cock blocked.
Those clever terrorists.
They blocked their cocks.
<i>Maybe I can be of some assistance.</i>
- Hit it, boys!
- Melissa Cherry!
# Oh, when you love me right up front
You know that I don't mind #
<i># But what I really want is for you
to take me from behind #</i>
<i># Oh, when you love me right up front
You know that I don't mind #</i>
<i>- # But what I really want is for you-#
- Come on, Cherry.</i>
# Oh, yeah #
What the fuck is going on?
Ahman, think unsexy thoughts!
Think unsexy thoughts.
Think unsexy thoughts.
Think unsexy thoughts.
Enough! Your immoral Western sexuality
will not work on us.
Mr. President, the time has come to
give in to our demands.
If we do not hear from you in 10 seconds,
we will kill everyone in this studio.
We might be fucked, sir.
Ten, nine, eight...
seven, six...
five, four, three, two, one!
<i>- Not so rápido.
- Peruvians.</i>
- Daddy, what's a Peruvian?
- It's kind of like a Mexican.
<i>- ¡Viva Perú!
- Qué viva.</i>
<i>Cockpuncher, amigo-</i>
<i>You know, Ahman,
violence is almost never necessary.</i>
<i>I admit, I've punched thousands
upon thousands of cocks in my life...</i>
but I've never killed anyone.
<i>Because no matter what
your religion might be...</i>
no matter
what your politics might be...
no matter how much
money's involved...
<i>there's never any reason
to take human life.</i>
Human life is the most
precious thing there is.
Fuckin'-A, man.
That's some cool shit, man...
You know what?
You are absolutely
right, Cockpuncher.
Violence is not the answer.
<i>Terrorism never solved anything.
To hell with terrorism.</i>
Yeah! Yeah.
I'm sick and tired of
living in a fucking cave.
I'm sick of doing nothing
but cursing the West all day.
Jesus H. Allah!
I like the West!
God bless America.
<i>I like TV! And I like
bacon double cheeseburgers!</i>
- Whoo!
- And I like the rapping music!
But most of all...
I like this big-budget
blockbuster action hero.
Long live the mighty puncher of cocks!
<i>¡Qué viva!</i>
Yeah! Whoo!
Hey, Norm. Some crazy shit, huh?
Look, with all due respect,
we just wanted to ask, um...
what were you gonna say
during your speech?
Yeah, we were wondering what
the conclusion that you came to was.
Well, I was going to say, " I'm mad as hell
and not going to take it anymore."
- But after what just happened...
- Shh.
I think I've learned a little lesson
I won't soon forget.
As a matter of fact, I think we've all learned
a few things in the past 90 minutes.
We've learned that Irishmen
have huge nipples.
We've learned that film-critic intellectuals
are a bunch of gaywads.
And, most of all, we've learned...
that creeping corporate
influence over the news...
protects us from terrorism.
<i>Hey, everybody, we're all gonna get laid!</i>
Um, I can't help but think...
it must have taken a lot of courage
to make such a provocative film.
And joining us
to discuss just that...
<i>is the man who green-lit the film.</i>
Thanks, Kenneth.
Pleasure to be here.
So, uh, now, while you gave the makers
of this film tremendous leeway, obviously...
still, there was some material
that you simply refused to allow?
That's true.
Basically, as committed as I was to letting
these guys be free to do their thing...
there were simply some images
that I just didn't feel comfortable with.
Mm-hmm. But I understand
you did bring some clips.
That's right. Uh, I would like to show
some special bonus material.
These are scenes that didn't
make it into the movie.
Great. Let's take a look.
So what we do is we get the kitty...
and we put it in
a simple egg batter.
Careful. Okay. Shh. That's fine.
And then we just simply roll it around...
making sure we cover
the whole thing.
It's all right, baby. It's okay.
Get him completely covered in
an her bed bread-crumb batter here.
I see. Okay. Oh!
Thank you.
And into- Oh- into the canola oil.
You know, I think you have to
draw a line somewhere.
