Thankyou very much.
If you justjoined us,
today's topic is...
''Myfather is evil, and he
wants to take overthe world.''
OK, let's meet Scott Evil.
Hi, Scott.
Nice to have you with us.
Tell us aboutyourfather.
My dad is the head of
a worldwide evil organization...
with aspirations
of world domination.
Pretty serious stuff.
Where is he now?
He's, like,
cryogenicallyfrozen...
orbiting the earth or something.
That's whatyou think.
We have a surpriseforyou.
Let's bring out
Scott'sfather Dr. Evil!
What?
General,
we've got a situation here.
What is it, Sergeant?
Hello, Scott.
Daddy's back.
How could you do this to me,
on national television?
Well,throw me
africkin' bone here, Scott.
Why'd you run out on me?
Because you're not quite
evil enough.
Well, it's true.
You're quasi-evil.
You're semi-evil.
You're the margarine of evil.
You're the Diet Coke of evil.
Just one calorie.
Not evil enough.
What are you,
some kind offreak?
-Shut up,you--
-OK, come on.
l'll kickyour...punk.
Bring it on, skanky--
All right, come on.
No one talks to my son
like that. lt's OK, Scott.
You mother--
You were born in your mother's--
l'm OK. All right.
You were born in your mother's--
l'll kill you both!
There you go!
Great!
l gotyour hood!
Settle down.
lt's OK.
lt's only a television show.
Calm down.
l'm all right. l'm easy.
-Everything OK?
-OK.
Getthis jerk out of here.
l'll give you--piece of--
He's biting me!
The...is biting me!
The world is mine,you--
You've got mail.
Hello, Basil.
Hello,Austin.
How was your honeymoon?
ltturns out
thatVanessa was afembot.
Yes. We knew all along, sadly.
Anyway, l have
a new assignmentforyou.
You're scheduledfor
a photo shoot...
and one of the models
worksfor Dr. Evil.
Groovy, baby!
Shaguar, ho!
Show me to the models, baby.
Letthe magic begin.
Who have we gottoday?
OK, great.
Austin Powers,
l've heard a lot aboutyou.
l'm Rebecca Romijn.
l don't believe
l've had the pleasure.
Well, of course
you haven't had...
the pleasure, Rebecca.
We just met, baby. Yeah.
Who are you, baby?
lvana.
lvana Humpalot.
Excuse me?
And l vanna toilet
made out of solid gold...
but it's just not
in the cards, is it?
You know...
OK, everyone, let's get started.
Yes, beautiful. Feeling it!
Let's get some smiles.
lt's all in here.
That's it. Yes!
Let's letthe inside out.
OK,you're an animal!
Yes,there we go.
You're a tiger!
You're Tony the Tiger!
You're grrreat!
Very good. Loving it.
Now you're a lemur.
Running as a pack.
We go left.
We go right.
There's a predator
out of the jungle.
What's going on?
Burrow!
That's right,you're a lemur.
That's all you've got.
You don't have sharpteeth
capable of biting.
Make an interconnected series
of tunnels like the Viet Cong.
And look.
l'm not even shooting you.
lt's crazy.
And l'm spent.
Right,that's a wrap, everyone.
Miss Humpalot.
Da, darling?
Shall we?
Give me moment, hmm?
Dr. Evil, several years ago...
we invested in a small
Seattle-based coffee company.
Today Starbucks offers
premium quality coffee...
at affordable prices.
De-lish!
If we shift our resources...
awayfrom evil empires
and towards Starbucks...
we can increase
our profitsfive-fold.
NumberTwo,
l make the decisions here, OK?
l demand a little respect.
Dr. Evil,
you have a little of the...
Silence!
l will nottolerate
your insolence!
Frau Farbissina,
wie geht es ihnen?
Sehr gut, Herr Doktor.
How are things?
l have come to embrace the love
that dare not speak its name.
To my right is my lover.
We met atthe LPGA Tour.
Her name is Unibrau.
Right on.
Welcome, Unibrau.
What?
A little milk...nose...mustache.
l know.
Meantto.
That's how we drink it
in Belgium.
Called a Belgian dip.
While you werefrozen...
we began a program to clone you.
Cool.
Send in the clone!
He is exactly like you
in every way.
Except one eighth your size.
Breathtaking.
l shall call him...
Mini-Me.
Your stock is rising,
NumberTwo.
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth.
Mini-Me, are you hungry?
Something to eat?
Not even a Hot Pocket?
An Eggo?
No,we don't gnaw on our kitty.
Leave Mini-Mr. Bigglesworth
alone.
Just love him and stroke him.
As you know...
every diabolical scheme
that l have hatched...
has been thwarted
by Austin Powers.
And why is that,
ladies and gentlemen?
'Cause you never kill him
when you getthe chance to...
and you're a big dope.
Down, Mini-Me.
Austin Powers always defeats me
because he has mojo.
Mojo?
The libido. The lifeforce.
The essence. The right stuff.
Whatthe French call
a certain...
l don't know what.
Ladies and gentlemen...
l've developed a device
fortraveling through time...
which l call a ''time machine.''
Using this ''time machine...''
l'm going backto the Sixties
and steal Austin Powers' mojo.
If you have a time machine...
why notjust go back
and kill Austin Powers...
when he's sitting
on the crapper or something?
How about no, Scott?
OK?
Why not use your knowledge
of thefuture...
to play the stock market?
We could make trillions.
Why make trillions
when we could make...
billions?
A trillion is more
than a billion, numnuts.
All right, zip it.
-You can't even--
-Zip it.
Zi-i-i-p.
Look, all l'm--
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, ex-zip-it ''A.''
NumberTwo,
would you please back me up?
-Look, l'm Zippi Longstocking.
-l can't--
When a problem comes along
You must zip it
Zip it good.
Frau,would you please--
Subtitle: ''Zip it.''
-l'm justtrying to--
-Zip.
Would you like to have
a suckle of my zipple?
-l wantyou--Stop--
-Zip.
Listen--All--You know--
You're like a child--
Talk in--If you--
Just--One time--
Zip it.
Unveil the time portal.
As you know...
Austin Powers
wasfrozen in 1967.
Therefore,
l will travel to 1969...
two years after he wasfrozen.
He'll be helpless.
Ladies and gentlemen...
l'm aboutto travel
through time.
l bid you adieu.
l'm OK.
Notturned on, l suppose.
Do you thinkyou could...
Yeah,thanks.
Come, Mini-Me!
Don't be scared, Mini-Me.
Welcome to 1969.
Thankyou, NumberTwo.
You look so healthy
and youthful.
Well,thankyou.
Herr Doktor.
And Frau,you look so...
Right.
l received your memo
from thefuture.
Your new lair is up and running.
ls it a hollowed-outvolcano
like l askedfor?
Of course.
Good.
Then it's all going
perfectly to plan.
Yeah, baby,yeah!
When did you getthe Clapper?
November 1964.
Dutch East lndies. Shore leave.
Do you know how we keepwarm
in Russia?
l can guess, baby.
We play chess.
l guessed wrong.
lttakes a keen intellect
to play chess.
l assume you know how to play.
Of course, baby.
Whatto do,whatto do.
Let me askyou a question.
And be honest.
Do l make you horny, baby?
Do l?
Do l make you randy?
No more games.
Dr. Evil sent me here
to kill you...
but lfind you so...
sexy and...
Just make love to me.
Now,Austin Powerovich.
Hurry!
You're hairy like animal!
Grr, baby! Very grr!
Make love to me, monkey man.
Dr. Evil, l don't understand...
how we can hope to steal
Austin Powers' mojo.
We've tried this before.
The security around Powers
isfoolproof.
Butthis time
we have an operative...
inside the Ministry of Defense.
Really?
Yes, really.
He's stealing Austin Powers'
mojo even as we speak.
Really?
He's a disgruntled
Scottish guard...
knownfor his lethal temper
and his unusual eating habits.
He weighs a metric ton.
His name...Fat Bastard.
We've had reports there's a spy
in the Ministry of Defense.
The contents of this room
are vital to the country.
Be on special alert.
Yes, sir.
And try to lose some weight,
for God's sake.
Mr. English colonel
tellin' me to lose weight.
l'm a hard case, he says.
Well, listen up, sonny Jim...
l ate a baby!
Oh, aye, baby.
The other otherwhite meat.
Baby: lt's what'sfor dinner.
l've gotyour mojo now,
sonny Jim.
What's wrong?
Crikey!
l've lost my mojo.
Austin,
the test results confirm...
thatyou've lostyour mojo...
and it couldn't come
at a worse time.
We have evidence that Dr. Evil
has developed a time machine...
and has traveled back
to the year 1969.
Luckily,we,too...
have developed
a time travel device...
to transportyou
backto the Sixties.
This is where you
inputyour destination.
Wait a tick.
Basil, if l travel backto 1969
and l wasfrozen in 1967...
presumably, l could go visit
myfrozen seIf.
But if l'm stillfrozen
in 1967...
how could l have been
unthawed...
in the Nineties
and traveled back--
Oh, no, l've gone cross-eyed.
l suggestyou don'tworry
aboutthis sort of thing...
and just enjoy yourseIf.
That goesforyou all,too.
This is smashing, Basil.
l go backto the Sixties,
recharge my mojo...
defeat Dr. Evil,
and be back in timefortea.
Swinging Sixties,
here l come, baby,yeah!
Move! Move!
Sorry.
l betthat's expensive.
Sorry.
Easy!
Stop it now,Austin!
Here we go.
Yeah, baby,yeah!
Godspeed,Austin Powers.
l'm home!
l'm back in the Sixties,
baby,yeah!
Getyour hands
off my Heine, baby.
Who are you today, baby?
My name is Robin Swallows.
Swallows.
That's an interesting name.
Maiden name's Spitz.
Which is it, baby,
Spitz or Swallows?
Those are skintight.
How do you get
into those pants, baby?
You can start
by buying me a drink.
l want! l want!
Better play it cool.
Yourfriend worksfor Dr. Evil.
And justwho
do you workfor, baby?
Tell me, Mr. Powers...
do you swing?
Are you kidding, baby?
l putthe ''Grr!'' in ''swinger,''
baby!
Then why don'tyou come right...
over here.
l can do that.
Prepare to die, Powers!
Use the machine gun!
Say good-bye, Powers!
Use the bazooka!
Thefall will kill us both,
Powers!
You can'twin, Powers.
Why won'tyou die?
Carefor a ride?
Go!
Austin Powers, l presume.
Powers by name,
Powers by reputation.
Felicity Shagwell, ClA.
Shagwell by name...
shag-very-well by reputation.
Oh, behave!
Not if l can help it.
You know what's remarkable
is how much England...
looks in no way
like Southern California.
Crikey!
We've got company! Looks like
one of Dr. Evil's assassins.
Steady now.
Hands up!
Do you remember me,
Austin Powers?
l don't recall your name
butyour...
fez isfamiliar.
My name is Mustafa.
And l'm the man
who will be killing you now.
Daktari!
Who sentyou?
You'll have to kill me.
Who sentyou?
Kiss my ass, Powers.
Who sentyou?
Dr. Evil.
-Thatwas easy.
-Thatwas.
Why did you tell us?
l can't stand to be asked
the same question three times.
ltjust irritates me.
Where is Dr. Evil hiding?
Why would he tell me?
l'm just one of his
low-levelfunctionaries.
Where is Dr. Evil hiding?
You'll have to torture me.
l'll nevertell you.
-Where is Dr. Evil hiding?
-Damn! Three times.
He's hiding
in the secretvolcano lair.
Where's Dr. Evil's
secretvolcano lair?
l spit atthe question.
Do l really have to askyou
two more times?
Go to hell, Powers!
Fine. Where is Dr. Evil's
secretvolcano lair?
l will take it
to the grave with me.
You have to answer.
He asked you three times.
The second question was...
''Do l really have to askyou
two more times?''
Thatwould be thefirst question
in a new line of questioning...
and wouldn't count in
the other line of questioning.
He's right.
However, l'm justtrying to
get informationfrom you, man.
l don't need any consistency
in the questions, do l?
No. You're preaching
to the converted--
If l'm preaching
to the converted...
then why are you
being so slavish...
to the three-questionform?
You're not even
looking at me, man.
Now you're just being rude,
you know what l mean?
You're not listening, man.
Oh, crikey!
Well,Austin, l thinkthis time
you havefinally metyour match.
Oh, no, baby.
l've beaten Dr. Evil before,
and l'll beat him again.
l was talking about me.
Hello upthere!
l seem to havefallen
down a cliff.
l'm still alive,
but l'm very badly injured.
l think my legs are broken.
l'll try to stand.
Yes,they are broken.
Perhaps you could
toss me a band-aid...
or some antibacterial cream.
l'm in an extraordinarily
large amount of pain.
The bone has
gone through the skin.
lfear it might be gangrenous.
The wound is beginning to smell
a little like almonds...
which is not good.
Please?
No one?
Sorry.
l'll try the other leg.
Two of my assassins are dead.
l will nottoleratefailure.
l'm the man who will
maintain the dignity...
of this evil organization.
Whatthe hell was that?
Volcanic eruption!
May l presentto you my spy
in the Ministry of Defense...
Fat Bastard.
Firstthingsfirst!
Where's your shitter?
l've got a turtle head
poking out.
Charming.
l'm not kidding.
l got a crap on deck
that could choke a donkey.
lt's squidgey!
Christ, l'm getting
all emotionalfrom it,you know?
Right.
Fat Bastard,
could l have my mojo, please?
Where's my money?
All right, give him his money.
Jesus Christ, he's tiny!
l've had bigger chunks of corn
in my crap.
Wait a minute.
He kinda looks like a baby.
Come here! l'm gonna eatyou!
l'm biggerthan you.
l'm higher on thefood chain.
Get in my belly!
Come on!
You're lucky,wee man!
Can l have a hug?
Let me make you a deal,
all right?
You getthe mojo,
you keepyour money...
and l'll getyour baby.
Right.
l want my baby back, baby back
Baby back, baby back,
baby back ribs
l want my baby back, baby back
Baby back, baby back,
baby back ribs
Excuse me.
Chili
Baby back ribs
Dr. Evil,what are we
going to do about Powers?
Austin Powers
is no longer a threatto me.
l have his mojo.
All right, everyone,
you're dismissed.
Private time.
Dr. Evil, l don'twantthis
to interfere with ourwork.
Don'tworry, mama.
Things won't getweird.
Onefor me...
and onefor my homies.
Herr Doktor.
So what happened here?
Apparently a rogue agent
named Fat Bastard...
infiltrated the unit...
assigned to guard
your cryogenic chamber.
He used some sort of nerve gas.
These men don't
remember a thing.
Captain,why don'tyou...
cross-check
Fat Bastard's profile...
with the mainframe at Langley?
Yes, ma'am.
Can l borrow that, please?
Thankyou.
Look at me.
l'm a sexy bitch, baby. Yeah!
You're a Popsicle,yes.
And l'm spent.
Let's go, baby,yeah!
Hey there. How are you?
Come on, Felicity.
Yeah, babe.
Shall we sit down?
This is great.
Groovy!
So,Austin,

Well,

and the Earth is ruled
by damned dirty apes!
Oh, my God!
Had youfor a second.
You can have mefor even longer,
if you want.
You're one groovy baby...

Too many ''babies.''
Don'tyou dare move.
Ladies and gentlemen,

You're quite good on yourfeet.
l'm even better off myfeet.
Oh, behave, baby.
-Hi.
-Hi there.
How are things?
Good, Herr Doktor. And you?
Great.
Justtaking a break?
Try the Hot Pockets.
They're breathtaking.
lt gotweird, didn't it?
-Ja.
-l knew it.
You haven't called.
We talked aboutthis.
We promised each other
itwouldn't getweird.
l can't let myfeelings
foryou interfere...
with my taking overthe world,
you know that.
You know,
l will never love another man.
Yes,that's true.
Dr. Evil, l'm late.
No,you got here right on time.
No, l mean ''l'm late.''
Dad.
Hey there, sport.
What are you doing here?
l was justthinking that maybe
we could work all this out.
After all,you are myfather.
Scott,you had your chance, OK?
l already had someone
created in my image.
He's evil, he wants
to take overthe world...
and hefits easily
into most overhead storage bins.
Him?
Look at him, he's crazy.
He's like a vicious
little Chihuahua thing.
He'll kill me
thefirst chance he gets.
Probably.
l love you.
l am a sexy bitch. Yes.
Felicity,
make yourseIf at home, baby.
What do you think of
my shag pad, darling?
lt's amazing,Austin.
Wait a tick.
That's how my mojo was stolen.
Fat Bastard.
She's a professional agent.
She's not interested
in shagging!
Please, God.
Spectacles,testicles,
wallet, and watch.
Austin, l'm waiting.
How about one of
yourworld-famous massages?
You mean a sensual massage?
Right,then.
OK, here we go. Yes.
Wait a minute,
something's itching me.
That's better.
Crikey.
How does thatfeel, baby?
Lower.
How does thatfeel, baby?
What?
You don't have to be cute
with me.
We're way pastthat.
We are?
What do you think?
Listen, Felicity...
l'm sorry.
l can't do this.
l have to go.
ls it me?
l can't explain.
Hello,Agent Shagwell.
Where's Austin?
l must've said something wrong,
so he just left all of a sudden.
Listen, l don'twantyou
getting too close to Austin.
lt's not meantto be.
l don't gettoo close
to anybody, Basil.
My interest in this case
is purely professional.
Good.
Then you won't mind tracking
down Fat Bastard tonight.
No problem.
We need you to plant
this homing device on him...
by any means necessary.
No problem.
Keep upthe good work.
Remember,
by any means necessary.
Look atyourseIf.
You used to be so virile.
You were a swinger, man.
And now you're nothing.
But at least
it can't get any worse.
Well, surprise, surprise, huh!
Look atthat meal.
l'm dead sexy.
Look at my sexy body.
Oh, look, l'm like a singer.
Oh, sexy man, sexy man
Eating like a sexy man can
By the way,
would you like some chicken?
l've got more.
No,thanks.
What have we got here?
Done with that.
All right,that's done.
Remember,
by any means necessary.
Frisky, are we?
Give it up!
Ladies and gentlemen...
we're aboutto begin phase two
of our evil project...
or is it phase--
l don't know phases.
Anyways,this is the phase...
in which we put
a giant ''laser'' on the moon.
As you know,the moon rotates
around the Earth, like so.
When the moon reaches...
its appropriate
lunar alignment...
itwill destroy
Washington D.C.
You see, l've turned the moon...
into what l like to call
a ''Death Star.''
-What?
-Nothing, Darth.
What did you call me?
Nothing. Rip-off!
Bless you.
Anyways,the key to this plan
is the giant laser.
ltwas invented by the noted
Cambridge physicist Dr. Parsons.
Therefore,we shall call it
the Alan Parsons Project.
Oh, my God.
What now?
The Alan Parsons Project is a
progressive rock band in 1982.
Why don'tyou just call it
''Operation Wang Chung,'' ass?
What should we--
l'm sure ''Operation Bananarama''
will be huge.
What are you saying?
-If you wanted--
-Shh!
Trying to be hip--
''WWW.shh.com.org.''
-You're so--
-Shh!
If we could put aside
thefamily squabbling...
l thinkwe could get down
to some serious business here.
-Really?
-Yeah.
l don't like that insolenttone.
-l meant nothing by it.
-You wantto run things?
No, not at all.
You wantto be Daddy,
is that it?
NumberTwo,you wantto wear
the Daddy pants?
You gonna cry?
You gonna cry?
What are you doing?
Are you gonna squirt some?
You gonna cry?
See,you were gonna cry.
You're a big man now, huh?
Yeah,thought so.
Aboutwhat happened last night--
You don't have to explain.
You don't understand.
You see...
l've lost my mojo.
Oh, so that's why you--
l thoughtyou didn't like me.
Oh, no, baby.
You're very shagadelic.
l just didn'twant
tofall in love again...
and l thoughtyou'd never
love me without my mojo.
lt's notyou.
You'refab, switched on,
a bit of all right. Yes!
That is so great.
There's something
l should tell you,too.
Last night, l planted
a homing device on Fat Bastard.
Smashing, baby.
Then we can track down
Fat Bastard...
get my mojo,
go backto my place...
hop on the goodfoot
and do the bad thing. Yes!
Butthere's more.
ln orderto get close
to Fat Bastard, l had to--
Hello, hello.
The signal's coming through.
He's at Paddington Station.
Let's go!
-We're close, baby.
-This way.
Straight--no, no, left.
Through here.
We've got him.
Private, bring upthe ram.
Go, go, go!
Where is he?
Oh, my God!
Fat Bastard left afloater!
ln the name
of all things sacred...
that is the most
foul-smelling thing ever!
Somebodyflush it down!
No, nobody touch anything.
We have to getthe sample
to the labto be analyzed.
l'm gonna give.
Austin,there you are.
Has the sample been analyzed?
Cor, baby.
You lookvery shagadelic!
But do we really have
to be here, Felicity?
l mean, it's so boring.
l don't believe in science.
When it comes to the spy game,
to me, it's all instinct.
-Hello, everybody.
-Hello, Basil.
The results are in.
We've discovered trace elements
of a rare vegetable...
found only on one island,
here, in the Caribbean.
What does it all mean, Basil?
lt means thatthis is
the location of Dr. Evil's lair.
Smashing, Basil.
Cor!
This coffee smells like shit.
lt is shit,Austin.
Oh, good,then it's notjust me.
lt's a bit nutty.
Excuse me, Dr. Evil.
l have to speakto you
aboutthis Mini-Me.
He's notfitting in?
ls he giving off too much
of a creepy Oompa Loompa vibe?
No, it's justthat he bites.
He's a biter.
What's wrong, Mini-Me?
Something you wantto tell us?
Teething.
Get me the president
of the United States of America!
Oh, he's on.
What do you want, Dr. Evil?
Mr. President,
in twelve hours...
l will destroy Washington D.C.
with this giant ''laser.''
Whatthe--?
Mini-Me, stop humping the laser.
OK, honestto God...
why don'tyou and the giant
laser get africkin' room?
Mr. President, after
l destroy Washington D.C...
l will destroy another major
city every hour on the hour.
That is, unless, of course,
you pay me...
one hundred billion dollars.
Dr. Evil,this is 1969.
That amount of money
doesn't even exist.
That's like saying, ''l want
a kajillion bajillion dollars.''
Come on, Mr. President,
show me the money.
Show you what money?
Show me the money,
show me the money.
You had me at hello.
Tear. Nothing? No?
Psst! lt's 1969.
''Jerry Maguire'' won't come out
for anotherthirty years.
Nobody knows what
you're talking about, ass.
Scott, Daddy's working, OK?
And when you're
in the main chamber...
try and use
the big boy voice, OK?
Thankyou.
Mr. President,
allow me to demonstrate...
the awesome lethality
of the Alan Parsons Project.
Fire the laser!
Damage report! Damage report!
lt's OK.
lt's all right. Come on.
Actually,thatwasfootage
from ''lndependence Day...''
butthe real laser
would be a lot like that.
Yeah, scary.
Now, Dr. Evil--
Talkto the hand, 'cause
theface don'twantto hear it.
What hand? Talkto your hand?
You ain't all that
and a bag of potato chips.
What are you talking about?
Don't go there, girIfriend.
Whose girIfriend?
Don't mess with me,
l'm one crazy mo-fo.
l had to pop a cop...
'cause he wasn't giving me
my props in Oaktown.
No? l heard that somewhere.
You're an idiot.
Mr. President, l think
we have an understanding.
Dr. Evil,what are our plans
regarding Austin Powers?
Austin Powers?
He's the snake to my mongoose.
Orthe mongoose to my snake.
Eitherway, it's bad.
l don't know animals.
But l do know this--
This time it's personal.
Kill him.
There's Dr. Evil's island.
Let's set up camp.
Be careful with that bag!
There's explosives in it.
This could be dangerous.
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us
Well done,very good.
Dr. Evil,thatwasfantastic.
Thankyou, NumberTwo.
l wrote that,yeah.
Dad, he putthis in my bed.
Who?
Your stupid mini-you.
He put road kill in my sheets!
What--Mini-Me,
don'tyou ever do that again.
You hear me,
don'tyou ever do that again!
l can't stay mad atyou.
Look atthat punum.
Dr. Evil's headquarters
is right overthat next ridge.
Let me look.
Damn it. How do we get in?
Hello, Mummy.
Can l have some chocolates?
l want some Mars Bars.
Don't smack my bottom, Mummy.
Sorry, love.
l got stuck
in your dirty pillows.
Let's look atthe map.
Austin,what's our plan?
According to this map...
the entire island is crawling
with Dr. Evil's guards.
l wantto make sure
the explosives didn't getwet...
but l can'tfind them.
Look in the bottom.
OK, l'll dig a little deeper.
Wow,this bag is reallyfull.
Just keep digging, darling.
l'll justfeel aroundforthem.
Good lord,Austin.
What do you keep in here?
Anything that catches
myfancy,you know.
Give it a good tug.
Do we really need this?
l'll askyou notto open that
inside,thankyou very much.
Oh, my God.
Oops, itwent off.
Yes, it does that
from time to time.
Eww. Yuck.
Yeah,that's nasty.
Yeah, sorry aboutthat.
Smelly.
These people make me sick.
Can you snap me a beer?
What is it?
lt's a gerbil.
How did that get in your bag?
l don't know.
Dr. Evil,we have a problem.
Austin Powers is on the island.
Bring him to me...alive.
You.
Hit it!
This is
a very sensitive subject.
Justthe two of us
Justthe two of us
From the moment l heard
Frau say l had a clone
l knew that l'd be safe
'cause l'd never be alone
An evil doctor shouldn't
speak aloud about hisfeelings
My hurt and my pain
don't make me too appealin'
l'd hoped Scott
would look upto me
Run the business of thefamily
Head an evil empire
just like his dear old dad
Give him my love
and the things l never had
Scottwould think
l was a cool guy
Return the love l have,
make me wantto cry
Be evil,
but have myfeelings,too
Change my life with
Oprah and Maya Angelou
But Scott rejected me,
c'est la vie
Life is cruel,
treats you unfairly
Even so, a God there must be
Mini-Me,you complete me
Justthe two of us
We can make it if we try
Justthe two of us
Justthe two of us
Justthe two of us
Building castles in the sky
Justthe two of us
You and l
You've gotthis packed
really tight.
Are you OK?
Yeah, l just got a bit
of a back cramp,that's all.
Just keep packing it in.
God.
lfound the explosives.
Help me checkthem.
You're surrounded!
Dropyourweapons!
Hands up!
Move out!
Ladies and gentlemen,
in just afew moments...
we're going to place
a giant ''laser'' on the moon.
From my ''Death Star...''
l will destroy
every city on the planet.
Get off of me.
Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell...
welcome to my
hollowed-outvolcano.
This is my associate
Fat Bastard.
Felicity, l thinkyou two
may have already ''met.''
Unfortunately.
ls that all the thanks l get
forthe night of hot sex?
l'm dead sexy.
You were crap!
ln your dreams.
Felicity would never
sleepwith you.
Right?
l did what l had to do.
l'm a secret agent.
What?
All right,that's enough,
Fat Bastard.
As much as l like
seeing Powers in agony--
and l do--
the thought of you naked
is just gross.
You can't stop me now,
Mr. Powers.
l have your mojo...
and l'm taking itwith me
to the moon.
Putthem in a jail cell.
My mojo! l'll getyou, Dr. Evil!
Look at me, l'm shaking
in my little space boots.
l want my mojo!
Great plan, Einstein.
You're gonna put him in a cell
with one inept guard...
and they'll escape!
God,you do this every time!
You know, Scott...
l've been africkin' evil doctor
forthirtyfrickin' years, OK?
Cut me somefrickin' slack.
Youforget, Scott,
we're in a volcano.
We're surrounded
by liquid hot magma.
What are you drawing?
lt's just a good-bye card,
that's all.
lt's sweet.
Hey, get him. Getthe baby!
Back off.
Simmer down. Simmer down.
He's my posse.
You take special care of him.
He's my special boy.
Attention, preparefor launch.
Repeat, all technicians

Colonel,you better

What is it, son?
l don't know, sir.
But it looks like
a giant--
-Dick!
-Yeah?
Take a look out of starboard.
Oh, my God,
it looks like a huge--
-Pecker!
-Oh,where?
Wait,that's not a woodpecker.
lt looks like someone's--
Privates!
We have reports of
an unidentifiedflying object.
lt is a long, smooth shaft,
complete with--
Two balls! What is that?
That looks just
like an enormous--
Wang! Pay attention.
l was distracted by
that enormousflying--
-Willie...
-Yeah?
What's that?
Well, it looks
like a giant--
-Johnson?!
-Yes, sir.
Call British lntelligence
and letthem know aboutthis.
What do we do?
Why don'tyou just shag
Fat Bastard again?
This is no time to getjealous.
How could you do it?
l was just doing my job.
No, l mean literally,
how could you do it?
The man's sofat...
the sheer mechanics of it
are mind-boggling.
Don't lay your hang-ups on me,
just 'cause you lostyour mojo.
Ouch, baby.
Very ouch.
Look,Austin,
we're running out of time.
l'm sorry.
l just did what l thoughtyou
would do in the same situation.
You're the reason
that l became a spy.
l thought l wanted to be you,
butthen l realized that...
l wantto be with you.
You do?
Hang on, baby.
Alleyoop!
We should talk aboutthis later.
Firstwe need to get past
that one inept guard.
Right, here's the plan.
What if l pretend to be ill
withfood poisoning?
The guard, drawn by my cries
of pain, comes to investigate.
Meanwhile,you dig a pit...
line itwith makeshift
punji sticks...
madefrom sharpened
toothbrushes.
The guardfalls in,
Bob's your uncle,we escape.
What do you think?
That mightwork,
butwhat aboutthis?
What do you think of these?
Mommy.
What a...burn?
That sort of thing
could get a man...fired.
l think he was...
hot...for...you.
-That's enough.
-Yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my moon base.
You've all been chosen to be
part of my elite moon unit.
Which is divided into
two divisions...
Moon UnitAlpha...
and Moon Unit Zappa.
ln exactly six hours...
the moon will move
in its orbit around the earth...
bringing Washington D.C.
within range of my giant...
''laser.''
Begin ''laser...''
ignition sequence.
Begin laser ignition!
Attention, Moon Unit Zappa
tofiring stations.
lnitiation sequence in progress.
OK, all right.
All l askedforwas africkin'
rotating chair, OK?
Getting a little afraid.
l need an old priest
and a young priest.
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.
Sick as a dog now.
Gonna vomit.
We need to hitch a ride
to the moon, baby.
Apollo Eleven is good to go.
Crew to all stations.
We will have liftoff
in T minusfive seconds...
four...three...two.
We have liftoff.
Apollo Eleven
has cleared the tower...
and is heading
for a rendezvous with the moon.
Arm the ''laser.''
Arming the laser!
Attention,
arming the Death Star.
Battle stations.
Laser on!
All crew at battle stations.
Get me the president.
You're gonna like this part,
Mini-Me.
This is the partwhere
we threaten the world leader.
l know we do it every time,
however it is importantto--
Where are you?
Can someone put africkin' bell
on him or something?
Great!
Somebody getthe stick.
Just grab on to the hook,
all right?
You complete me.
l love you.
Hang in there, Mini-Me.
If anything
should happen to you...
l don't know what l would do.
l'd probably move on,
get another replica.
Butthere'd be
a ten-minute period there...
when l would just be
inconsolable.
We have your money, Dr. Evil,
but itwasn't easy.
Papa has to do some work, OK?
Well,you have exactly
thirty minutes to get itto me.
Ciao.
Jiminy jumpin' Jesus,
l can't believe
we're gonna pay that madman.
l got nukes upthe ying-yang.
Just let me launch one,
for God's sake.
Are you suggesting
thatwe blow upthe moon?
Would you miss it?
Would you miss it?
Mission control,
the swinger has landed.
Airlock, open.
Repressurize.
Let'sfind Dr. Evil.
Enjoy your stay on the moon.
There he is.
l'll coveryour rear.
No,you go ahead.
This time it's personal.
No more.
l can'ttake it anymore.
Peace?
You brought my glasses.
Bless your little heart.
Well,that's not right.
Don't--That's just--
Now l'm pissed.
Judoflip!
Poor little bugger.
He's so small.
He's like a dog or something.
Poor little bugger.
Get off!
Get out of my suit!
lttickles. lttickles.
Gotcha!
Poor little bugger.
l salute you.
All right, slap-head.
Turn around.
Where's my mojo?
Well, it looks like you
have a choice, Mr. Powers--
save the world...
or save your girIfriend.
Don'tworry about me,Austin.
You've gotto save the world.
Kill him!
Fire the ''laser.''
Target locking.
God!
Laser settofull vitality.
Judo kick!
You may have won the battle,
Mr. Powers...
butyou lostthe war.
Wake up, Felicity. Wake up!
Escape pod ninety-five.
l love you, Felicity.
l love you.
Dr. Evil! l'll kill him!
Gotcha!
You shot me,you a-hole.
And now l'm going to kill you.
Before you do that...
know this...
l am yourfather.
Really?
No, not really.
l can't backthat up.
Right. ldiot. Yes.
But isn't it interesting,
Mr. Powers...
thatyou would rather kill me...
than save
your precious Felicity?
What do you mean?
Remember,there's a time portal
in the main chamber.
You could go back and save her.
l'll do that.
Good work!
Well, it looks like you
have a choice, Mr. Powers--
save the world
or save your girIfriend.
Don'tworry about me,Austin.
You gotta save the world.
l choose love, baby.
Wait a tick. Who are you?
l'm you,ten minutesfrom now.
Damn it! You are handsome.
l was justthinking the same.
We are sexy.
We are sexy bitches. Yeah!
All right.
This is ri-goddamn-diculous.
Kill them both!
Fire the ''laser.''
Listen, pastAustin...
can you save the world
while l go getthe girl?
Sure,Austin-from-
ten-minutes-from-now.
Lock in target.
Laser settofull vitality.
Come on. Are you all right?
Yeah, come on.
You all right?
You OK?
Say,what's the policy
on ménage a trois?
You are adorable!
Lookingforthis, Mr. Powers?
My mojo.
SeIf-destruct in
two minutes and counting.
Watch out!
See you in hell, Powers.
Hey,Austin-from-
ten-minutes-from-now!
This place is gonna blow.
Let's go. Come on.
Thirty seconds and counting.
Twenty-nine...
-Let's go.
-My mojo!
We have to go now.
My mojo. l'm useless without it.
You've had it all along.
What do you mean?
You defeated Dr. Evil,
you saved the world...
and believe me,
you're gonna getthe girl.
All rightthen, maybe later.
Yeah, come on.
Go!
l'll setthe controlsfor 1967.
Felicity,why don'tyou come
with me to 1999?
l don't know.
The Sixties were so groovy.
l wantto see what happens
in the Seventies and Eighties.
The Seventies and the Eighties?
You're not missing anything.
l looked into it.
There's a gas shortage
and a Flock of Seagulls.
That's about it.
Let's go.
l love you,Austin Powers.
And l love you,
Felicity Shagwell.
Whereverwe go...
there we are.
Special delivery.
Surprise, surprise.
Listen, missy,
do youfancy another go?
'Cause once you've hadfat,
you never go back.
You shutyour mouth,
you bastard...
who isfat.
Yeah,that's very good.
Before you kill us,
let me askyou one question.
Are you happy?
What kind of stupid ass
question is that?
l'm rich, and l'm dead sexy.
You didn't answer my question.
Are you happy?
Of course l'm not happy.
Look at me, l'm a bigfat slob.
l've got biggertitties
than you do.
l've got more chins
than a Chinese phone book.
l've not seen my willie
in two years...
which is long enough
to declare it legally dead.
l can't stop eating.
l eat because l'm unhappy.
l'm unhappy because l eat.
lt's a vicious cycle.
If you'll excuse me...
there's someone l have to get
in touch with andforgive.
MyseIf.
Oh, God.
Sorry, lfarted.
lt's a long road ahead.
Who am l kidding?
l'm going to kill you anyway.
Judo chop!
Right in the mommy-daddy button!
That'sfor calling me crap,
youfatty.
Listen, baby, l don't care
if he is a Fat Bastard...
you don't give a man
a shot in the pills.
lt's just not cricket.
Do you think l'll be happy
here in the Nineties?
Well, l know the Nineties
might sound boring...
but asfar as l'm concerned...
l've broughtthe best part
of the Sixties backwith me.
You.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
Did we get Dr. Evil?
No. He got away in that rocket
that looks like a huge...
Penis.
The male reproductive organ.
Also known as tallywhacker,
schlong, or...
Wiener?
Any of you kids
want anotherwiener?
Dad,what's that?
l don't know, son,
but it's got great big...
Nuts! Hot, salty nuts!
Who wants some?
Lord almighty!
That looks just like
my husband's...
One-eyed monster.
Step right up and see
the one-eyed monster!
Hey,what's that?
lt looks like a big...
Woody! Woody Harrelson?
Can l have your autograph?
Sure, no problem.
Oh, my Lord. Look atthatthing.
lt's so big.
l've seen bigger. That's...
Just a little prick.
lt's aflu shot.
You've been
in the coldness of space.
l don'twantyou to get sick.
lt's one thing to attack me.
lt's quite another
to attack my Mini-Me.
l'm gonna getyou,
Austin Powers.
l'm gonna getyou.
Thankyou. Welcome back.
Today we're doing afollow-up...
to a segment
we did several months ago...
on ''Fathers who are trying
to take overthe world.''
Let's begin with Scott Evil.
What's going on with your dad?
Well, my dad tried to take
overthe world...
with a giant laser on the moon.
l know.
We have a surpriseforyou.
What, my dad?
No, it's notyourfather.
lt's your mother.
Come on out.
Mom?
Scott,you are my love child
with Dr. Evil.
l thought
l was a test-tube baby.
Lies. All lies!
l love you, Mom.
l love you,too, son.
Thankyou.
You know,
what have we learned here today?
Perhaps it's that
no one can take your mojo.
You can look around
all you want...
butwhatyou're really trying
tofind is on the inside.
Take care of yourseIf
and each other.
l think l'm gonna like it
in the Nineties.
l never knew
it could be this way!
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
That's good.
How could you?
l thoughtthat--
PastAustin?
Technically,
it's not cheating, baby.
Felicity, l can't blame you.
The man is handsome, baby!
We're just plain handsome, man.
Am l wrong,
butthis makes me horny, baby.
Very randy!
Well, one thing'sfor sure--
l've got my mojo back.
lt's definitely back.
Hello. You all right?
Me spuds are boiling.
Come on, darling,
let's hop on the goodfoot...
and do the bad thing.
Paging Dr. Freud.
Hello upthere.
ls the movie over?
l'm still down here...
and l'm still in
quite a lot of pain.
Maybe someone in the lobby
could call an ambulance.
Oh,the pain
is really quite severe.
l'vefashioned
a makeshift splint.
Here goes nothing.
