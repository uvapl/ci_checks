<i>Hip-hop hooray, ho</i>
<i>Hey, ho</i>
<i>I just read that
money as we know it is dead.</i>
Soon the world is only gonna buy
and sell products using bitooins.
It's like a complicated
math equation.
So, one day we're
gonna buy things
with numbers from
a math equation?
Dope, right?
<i>Malcolm Adekanbi is a geek.</i>
<i>Malcolm lives with
his single mother</i>
<i>and has only one memory
of his father.</i>
<i>Malcolm lives
in Inglewood, California,</i>
<i>in the Darby-Dixon neighborhood
referred to as the Bottoms.</i>
<i>You drew</i> a <i>picture of my
morning but you couldn't make my day</i>
<i>I'm rockin' and you're yawnin'
but you never look my way</i>
<i>I'm lickin' down your darlin'
In every single way</i>
<i>Your funny flow is foreign And
your green card's on the way</i>
<i>This ain't got
to do with shampoo</i>
<i>But watch your
head and shoulder</i>
<i>Brother, older, bold enough
To fold ya, yo, I told ya</i>
<i>A raid, afraid of what I made
and played it plus a funky fit</i>
<i>So save your flips And tricks for
that music and the monkey bit</i>
Give me your bike, nigga!
<i>Malcolm's friends,
Jib and Diggy, are also geeks.</i>
Yo.
Shit.
All I want to do is a zoom,
zoom, zoom and the boom, boom.
Word.
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy</i>
<i>are all deeply obsessed
with '90s hip-hop culture,</i>
<i>submerging themselves
in the music,</i>
<i>watching old Yo! MTV Raps
episodes for fashion tips,</i>
<i>and using the slang.</i>
Huh?
Bro, that shit
was whack.
What?
They were biting Brand Nubian.
That's not
even possible.
Ah, jackpot, niggas.
Gushy, gushy.
Mmm.
<i>Oh, did I mention
that Diggy was a lesbian?</i>
<i>Although from the way
she dresses,</i>
<i>you might not have
noticed she's a girl.</i>
Save her, Lord!
Yo, hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
<i>Every Sunday, her grandmother asks
the church to lay their hands on her</i>
<i>in order to pray away the gay.</i>
Praise the Lord!
So, did it work?
You know.
I was watching Justin
Bieber the other night
and I got a little moist.
Yeah?
So maybe.
That's just because
he's a little ho, though.
That's true.
- He's a very pretty nigga.
- Yes, he is.
What's up, boss?
<i>For most geeks,
a bad day might be</i>
<i>being the butt of jokes
in class,</i>
<i>the occasional food prank, and the
worst, being beat up by a jock.</i>
<i>But when you live
in the Bottoms,</i>
a <i>bad day might be
accidentally getting killed.</i>
<i>Like Wytony Johnson,</i>
<i>who got shot buying
a pastrami cheeseburger</i>
<i>from Jimmy's Burger
on Centinela.</i>
Hey! It's the Rollin 60s,
dumb-ass niggas!
<i>The real tragedy is,</i>
<i>that he was seconds away
from defeating Ganon.</i>
<i>He had a hell of
a comic book collection.</i>
<i>Jib has been trying to talk Wytony's
mom into giving them to him</i>
<i>for the past two weeks.</i>
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy don't play
sports and they aren't in a gang.</i>
<i>They're always getting
ridiculed by their peers</i>
<i>because they're
into white shit,</i>
<i>like skateboards, manga
comics, Donald Glover,</i>
<i>and for listening
to white shit</i>
<i>like TrashTalk,
TV On The Radio,</i>
<i>and for doing white shit</i>
<i>like getting good grades
and applying to college.</i>
<i>Malcolm, Jib and Diggy used to
be in the school marching band,</i>
<i>but quit in protest after refusing
to play the Harlem Shake.</i>
<i>They arranged to use
the music room during lunch</i>
<i>for their recently formed
punk band, Awreeoh.</i>
One, two. One, two,
three, four!
Yeah
<i>First day of school
Hey!</i>
<i>Good grades are cool</i>
<i>Trying to find
a new way to rule</i>
<i>And land a new major boo</i>
<i>My, my, is that why</i>
<i>Bumping young jeezy inside</i>
<i>I march to the beat
of my own drum</i>
<i>And tomorrow don't care
about the outcome</i>
<i>lt's time to get live, live
I mean fucking live</i>
<i>Adrenaline on overdrive
Come on!</i>
<i>Life at home is hard to
survive Come on, Jib!</i>
<i>Your friends come over
to give you a ride</i>
<i>Hey! So hot, you

<i>So much anger

<i>Then you say,
'sup with this?</i>
<i>Storm out of

<i>Fuck this shit!</i>
<i>I won't act like

<i>But no, you can't

<i>It seems that lately</i>
<i>Your homeboy's

<i>Stay acting shady</i>
<i>My ego might just make me</i>
Go ahead

Go ahead
<i>Make some noise
Make some noise</i>
Hey, hey! You know
the program, niggas.
Shoe program.
Turn around.
Let me see what the fuck
you working with.
Oh, shit, man.
All these motherfucker <i>s</i> got
small feet around this bitch.
God damn! Nigga, I don't
know why you was looking.
Hey-hey!
My nigga, my e.
Oh, man.
Where the fuck
you goin', man?
God damn!
What's up with you?
Hey, them last shoes you gave
me, man, I was feeling them.
Classics. The Force 2s?
Yeah, I was liking those.
What's these you got on?
Bro, these are straight
from the flea market.
Shut the fuck up,
nigga.
These the J3s, with
the red mark on 'em.
Oh, yes.
Come up out
those right now.
Right now, nigga!
You speak English?
Do I gotta beat the shit out
of you again and take them?
Damn.
This nigga's speaking
African or some shit,
like he don't
speak what we speak.
This nigga always...
Hey!
Go, Dig! Come on!
Dig! Go!
Come on, Dig!
Oh, shit!
Hey, hey.
Hold up, hold up.
Get your fuckin'
hands off me, man!
Don't think I won't
beat your ass, Marquis!
I came up with your daddy.
You better ask him
about Stacey.
And see what's what
around this motherfucker!
Let's go, man.
I'm gonna get the other one,
you little, bitch-ass nigga.
Go, man.
Malcolm, when I see stuff
like this personal essay,
I think you're not taking
the process seriously.
I'm... I'm taking it seriously, Mr.
Bailey. I promise.
I'm talking about
something that I love.
I mean, it's well-reasoned,
supported with historical data,
it shows creativity,
critical thinking.
If Neil deGrasse Tyson
was writing about Ice Cube,
this is what
it would look like.
I suggest you go
in a different direction.
Write something
personal about you.
Your family, your life.
I mean, I... I could
write about the typical,
"I'm from a poor,
crime-filled neighborhood,
"raised by a single mother, don't
know my dad..." blah-blah.
It's cliché.
This here, this, this is...
This is creative. This
shows that I'm different.
This is the kind of essay
that Harvard wants
from their students.
Malcolm, I'm gonna be
honest with you.
You're pretty damn arrogant. You
think you're gonna get into Harvard?
Who do you think
you are, hmm?
You go to high school
in Inglewood.
To the admissions committee, your
straight A's, they don't mean shit.
If you're really serious
about this exercise
and you're not
just wasting my time,
or yours,
then it's gonna be about
your personal statement,
your SAT scores,
your recommendations.
And most importantly, your
alumni interview tomorrow.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
You'd better be.
I just found out you're
interviewing with Austin Jacoby.
He's from Inglewood too,
so he'll be able to relate
to your circumstances.
Jacoby Check Cashing?
Harvard? Really?
I'm sorry. They don't all
go on to be president.
<i>NARRATOR'. On this day,</i>
<i>their usual route home is
blocked by a Blood gathering.</i>
<i>They were shooting a video
for their YouTube channel.</i>
Well, where do
you want to go?
Some nigga really
needs to invent an app
like Waze to avoid
all these hood traps.
<i>The only way to get
home is down 104th street.</i>
<i>But that's where
the dope dealers are,</i>
<i>who, for sport, routinely
try to steal their bikes.</i>
Go!
Hey, little nigga.
<i>Such is the life of</i> a <i>geek
in the Bottoms- Come</i> here.
<i>A daily navigation between
bad and worse choices.</i>
Hey! Come here,
little nigga.
Yo, man.
I be seein' you
and your little friends
with y'all flattops
and MC Hammer pants,
riding around
in this shit,
looking like y'all came out
of a DeLorean or some shit.
Fuck is up with
that shit anyway?
You know, the '90s was like
the golden age of hip-hop.
<i>Everything from
It Takes A Nation Of Millions</i>
to The Blueprint
was killing it.
I guess me and my friends just
wish we grew up back then.
<i>It Takes</i> a <i>Nation
came out in</i> '88.
<i>Blueprint</i> came <i>out</i> 2001.
What the fuck are you
talkin' 'bout right now?
Technically, um...
But, you know, the spirit of the
music was definitely still '90s.
<i>I mean, It Takes a Nation,
Straight Outta Compton,</i>
<i>Paid</i> in Full
was ahead of their time.
And then you got Snoop,
Biggie, Wu-Tang.
They took the game
to the next level.
Blueprint was kind of like
the punctuation mark.
Let's not forget, the '90s also
gave us Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer.
And we can't forget
about the Fresh Prince.
Everything in the '90s
wasn't great, but...
Oh, shit.
But you gotta admit
Summertime was a classic.
What's your name,
little nigga?
Uh, it's Malcolm.
Look here, Malcolm. I want
you to do a favor for me.
You see that green apartment there
in the middle of the block?
There's a nice
little piece over there.
I want you to go up to her and tell
her that Dom wants to talk to her.
Uh, that's... That's it?
Yeah, nigga.
Can you handle that?
Uh...
Yeah.
Get to pedalin', nigga.
Drop that up here.
Yeah.
You gonna say something
or just stare at me?
Um...
Dom says that he would like you
to come over and talk to him.
Well, why don't you tell Dom
that if he wants to talk to me,
he can come over here
and be a fucking man,
and not send a little
kid to talk for him.
Tell him just like that.
She said that shit?
And that Dominique was way
cooler before he became Dom.
And, um, that if you
think that she cares
about your dope money,
she... She doesn't.
Listen, tell her
that I'm throwing
a birthday party
at Verse tonight,
and l would really enjoy the
pleasure of her company.
Go ahead, nigga.
You should, uh... You
should work inside out.
Do the stuff in the brackets
first and then square the sum.
Yep-
Okay. Thanks.
Oh! Um...
Dom says he's throwing a
birthday party tonight at Verse.
Mmm-hmm.
He said he'd really love the
pleasure of your company.
That nigga did not
say that.
He did. I...
I swear. He...
Lord.
Well, I'll go if you go.
I'll save you a dance.
<i>You are going.</i>
We are going.
She metaphorically showed you her
pussy and said, "Come and fuck me."
- Jib, um...
Mmm-hmm.
...this is Dom
we're talking about.
We're not going to a drug
dealer's birthday party.
That's... You're trippin'.
We're in our senior year,
bitches. Okay?
It is time we started
expanding our horizons.
No.
Call your mom
and tell her you're...
You're studying late
at my place.
Come on. Dig? Huh?
Look, it's better than what you
normally do at night, so...
Mmm-hmm.
<i>Don't stop, pop that pussy</i>
Oh, hey, ladies.
Hey, ladies.
Oh, looking beautiful.
<i>One, two and tres.</i>
Been working on my spa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What you doing?
You let them in
without checking the list.
What's up?
Okay, uh, let me
educate you real quick.
lam the gatekeeper, I'm the
grandmaster, the authority
in keeping a proper
nigga-to-ho ratio.
You understand
what I'm saying?
So unless you little niggas
got some pussies,
I'm gonna need y'all to get the fuck...
I have one.
I know y'all some bitches, but you
ain't gotta say you got pussies.
No,no,no,no.
She... She's a girl.
What?
This little nigga's a bitch!
Like... Like <i>Boys</i> Don't Cry
like a motherfucker.
Remember when we
was seein' that shit?
Yeah, I remember that.
Nigga, what the fuck.
Let us in.
Oh, well, yeah, yeah.
You know, it's 21 and older.
I'm gonna need some ID,
some verification.
Uh. Uh.
Aw, wait.
Y'all don't have no IDs?
Sorry! I'm gon' need
y'all to get the fuck off.
Come on.
Get the fuck off.
There's a Baskin-Robbins down the street.
Enjoy yourselves.
Hey, man,
don't this dude look like
the dude that danced
in Santa Monica?
Breakdance? Don't he look like...
What the fuck.
You're coming in, right?
Get the fuck
outta here, man!
Get the fuck
outta here, man.
Old Coolio-looking
motherfucker.
Hey, baby.
You're looking good.
Oh, thank you.
Digs. Digs. Digs. Jib. Jib.
Come on, come on.
Hey. Hey, Wait... Hey!
Yo, yo, yo. It's cool.
It's cool. Let 'em in.
Look,I...
I can't let you do that.
These kids are underage
and I cannot lose
my license tonight.
Not tonight.
I don't mind having
this discussion with you.
I actually enjoy the
thoughtful exchange of ideas.
And you do bring up a valid point.
Know what I'm sayin'?
But see, you put me in
a bit of a spot, nigga.
'Cause I can't have you back-talkin'
me in front of my niggas
without at least
fuckin' your ass up.
You feel me? Oh, look, you
don't have to do that.
I kind of do though. I mean, I don't
want to. It's my birthday and shit.
But there's principles to this
shit, and I'm a principled man.
Hey, look, they in, Dom.
It's all good.
I know they got in.
That's my point.
But I got this nigga
telling me what he
can't let me do and shit.
Like I give a fuck!
Man, if I let this shit slide, we got
what they call a slippery slope.
You know what
a slippery slope is, nigga?
No.I don't..I don't
know what a slippery...
- Anyone?
Mmm-mmm!
Do it got anything
to do with skiing?
Nigga, sit your
ass down, man.
I know using your brain
is a challenge and shit.
You said slope,
you ski on a slope...
You might fuck around,
give yourself a concussion.
It's a small event that leads
to a chain reaction of events
with unintended consequences
that were unforeseen at the
time of the inciting event.
See, this is a smart little
nigga right in here, bro.
You probably got one of them
"photogetic" brains or some shit, huh?
You mean
photographic memory?
Nigga, what I just say?
I mean, yeah, you said it.
I'm reiterating that...
I'm still a little shaky on the concept.
Basically, if I let
this nigga slide, man,
then I'm going to have
the next nigga coming along,
thinking they can pop off and
shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
And so on and so forth.
Damn!
Oh, shit.
Hey, little nigga,
you coming in?
Yo, it's cool.
You coming in, Malcolm?
Nigga, come on.
Yeah.
Nigga, school's out. What the
fuck you doing with a bag on?
Hey, throw this behind the
bar for my little homey.
Yo, let me get
a round of shots.
Cheers.

Damn, nigga, that was ill.
This nigga doesn't know what hit him.
Check this nigga out.
He's walking his jihad dog and
shit, scratching his nuts.
Yahtzee, nigga.
Oh, this shit crazy.
Yo, man, straight up, I really used
to think Obama was a bitch, man.
Drones, though, nigga?
That's some gangsta shit. I
need one of them motherfuckers.
That shit ain't funny.
It's fucked up if you
really think about it.
How, nigga? He killing all
them al-Qaidas and shit.
Nigga, that ain't
all that gets killed.
And that nigga's saying he can
drone-strike Americans too.
They killed an American working
with them niggas in Yemen.
Man, he was a terrorist, dawg.
So it's like set trippin'.
You can't
decide to be a Blood,
and then get mad if the Crips
try to kill you and shit.
Man, all I'm saying is,
this shit started somewhere
like Pakistan or some shit.
And before you know it, they'll start
saying that we're the terrorists.
They're gonna have planes
riding all around Inglewood,
droppin' bombs on
Crenshaw and shit, man.
Ah! Slippery slope-
Exact, nigga.
Shit, I wish a nigga would try
to fly drones in my hood.
Fuck that
Hell yeah.
I wish I would see one of them
motherfuckers in Inglewood, man.
For real. Don't let them
niggas come to my hood.
What you got there?
Breakfast club, nigga.
Molly Ringwald.
So, this the latest and
greatest shit, huh? Yes, sir.
Pure as a nun's pussy.
Know what I'm sayin'?
This ain't like
that ghetto shit

<i>Lookin' for your ticket
Now let's all go</i>
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Malcolm!
Shit.
Come on. I drove.
Thanks for helping me.
Most of those niggas just
saw me and stepped over me.
Luckily for you, I'm not
one of those niggas.
Oh, really?
What are you, then?
I don't know.
I'm just...
I'm black as fuck, right?
I guess I'm just
used to hearing that
niggas don't listen to this,
niggas don't do that,
niggas don't go to college unless
they play ball or whatever.
It's just time to accept it.
I'm just not
one of those niggas.
Well, me neither, then.
'Cause I'm going to college.
Just gotta get my GED first.
That's what
you were studying for.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
If I pass, I'll go to El Camino
or Santa Monica or something.
Transfer to Dominguez
or Northridge.
Well, you shouldn't
sell yourself short.
You could do better.
You hardly know me.
So how can you say that?
I can just tell.
You shouldn't settle
for what's expected.
Like Dom, right?
L...
I didn't say that.
Don't try and be slick.
You're trying to
block him.
So, you two...
You guys...
It's complicated.
But trust me,
he's got nothing on you.
You probably got all the girls lined
up asking you to prom and shit.
You making fun of me?
No, no.
I'm sorry.
Hey, I didn't go
to my prom.
You didn't go to your prom?
Seriously.
I had one guy ask me.
Anthony Davis.
And he fucking stood me up.
I didn't even care
about missing prom.
I was more mad about not going
to Six Flags the next day.
All my friends had dates.
I didn't want to go alone.
Would you want to
go to prom with me?
l mean, I...
I know that I'm not
complicated or... But...
It's just with
studying and all,
I don't think
I'll have time.
But thank you.
What if I helped you study?
And what if
you passed the GED?
Would you go with me then?
I'll think about it.
0kay.)'-
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
<i>MB". Three words.</i>
Did you fuck?
Oh, man, you're a pussy, nigga.
Come on, man.
She let me feel her titties
and finger-bang her.
Bullshit.
No, I'm dead-ass serious.
Smell my fingers.
I don't smell shit.
Yeah!
Just cream. You never
smelled pussy before.
Wait. I have.
I don't smell shit.
See, she don't
smell shit either.
'Cause you only
know your pussy.
Exactly!
Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute. You two go
back through, one at a time.
One at a time.
What's getting into you?
Come on.
Hey, hey. Calm down.
Go. Everybody else wait.
Turn around, go back.
We gotta do pat-downs.
The machine is broke.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Yo, yo, yo.
Oh, shit!
What's wrong? What?
Oh, shit.
Fuck!
Is that real?
Boy, how'd you
get this shit?
I have no fucking clue, Jib.
No fucking clue.
What do you mean you don't
have a fucking clue?
I have no fucking clue
where that gun came from.
Or the drugs.
Drop your weapons!
Oh, shit.
Get the fuck outta here.
Let's move. Go!
Last night at
the fucking party.
At the party. Dom put that
shit in my bag. Had to be.
Well, we gotta
get rid of it, then.
You know? Dump it, or...
Yeah.
Or take it to the police. Yeah.
Let's take it to the police.
Are you joking?
You want three niggas
to take a bag full of dope
and a gun to
the fucking police station?
Like, "Here you go"?
I...
And you don't expect Dom
to find out who snitched?
Well, what do you
wanna do with it?
Yo, that's a lot of weight.
It's like 20, 30 keys.
I don't know.
It's a lot of shit, right?
I don't know, Dig.
I don't know
anything about this shit.
All I know is Jeezy paid LeBron
and Jay paid Dwyane Wade.
What?
He was talking
about dope?
Shit.
I answered it.
You did what?
I don't want that shit.
Oh!
Shit.

<i>A nigga</i> hungry. Yes. Yes, I...
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Baloney sandwich.
Mmm-hmm.
<i>Baloney.
It got cheese on it?</i>
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
<i>We talking about
the same sandwich, nigga?</i>
<i>'Cause I ain't
ask for no cheese.</i>
<i>I find that my fucking
sandwich got cheese on it,</i>
<i>I'm gon' kill your ass.</i>
I don't know.
You just... You know, there's a bag and...
<i>What? What?</i>
<i>You're the one wanted to get
all cute, talkin' 'bout</i>
<i>baloney sandwiches and shit.</i>
<i>I just asked you
if you had my lunch.</i>
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
Your lunch. It's right here.
I'm looking at it right now.
<i>Coolio.</i>
<i>Now, after school, you're gon'
see a red El Camino parked,</i>
<i>and this
handsome-ass nigga inside.</i>
<i>That ain't Lance Gross, nigga.
That's yours truly.</i>
<i>Just walk up, hand me the baloney
sandwich and be on your way.</i>
<i>You have a nice,
happy, productive life</i>
<i>with a hell of
a story to tell.</i>
<i>You got it?</i>
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Red El Camino
after school. Cool.
<i>It's almost over,
little nigga. You did good.</i>
What the fuck did we
get ourselves into, man?
I don't see it.
Where is it?
Yo, he's over there.
- Where?
- To the right.
Oh, I see him.
You good?
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
You good? All right.
Yeah.
He asked for you alone,
you know?
I got your back and all.
It's just I don't wanna mess
with his explicit instructions.
You'll be fine, bro.
Right?
You're just dropping it off.
You're good.
He's good. He's good.
Uh...
Hey. Yeah.
I'm, uh...
l got your lunch.
I'm walking to
the red El Camino right now.
What you <i>say?</i>
Who's this?
<i>This is Dom, man.</i>
<i>Look, do you have
what I left in the backpack?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.
You in the red El Camino?
<i>What the fuck
you talking about?</i>
Somebody called me earlier saying
I need to bring him the sandwich.
<i>Nigga, why the fuck are you talking
about sandwiches right now?</i>
The... The backpack.
He... The guy, he said that I needed
to bring it to him after school.
He'd be in
a red El Camino.
Yo, McFly,
I want you to listen to what I'm
about to tell you right now.
Somebody snitched.
<i>I'm in county right now. I don't
know who the fuck called you.</i>
There's two possibilities.
Either the motherfucker
in the El Camino is po-po.
As soon as you give him the
package, he gon' arrest you.
<i>Or that
motherfucker's the snitch.</i>
<i>In that case, he'll take
the package, kill you,</i>
<i>then I'm headed to Chino
with a price on my head.</i>
Look, I'm gonna
need you to trust me
right about now,
you understand?
<i>Do not take that
backpack to the nigga</i>
<i>in the whip, else we both fucked.
Hear me?</i>
I'm gonna text you
this address.
Go there, ask for A.J. Tell
him it's about the boys club.
<i>Give him the package. Tell him
it's from me. You hear me?</i>
<i>Nigga, run. Get the fuck
out of there, nigga.</i>
<i>Run. Go now! Get the fuck out of there!
Oh, sh“.</i>
<i>Go!</i>
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Go! Let's go!

Oh, shit!
Let's go! Let's go!
Move the fucking car!
Let's go!

Yo, man,

Who the fuck was that?
Dom.
What?
Dom! That nigga
called me
and said that the nigga
that called earlier
isn't with him.
Well, then who is he?
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
How the fuck

Yo, let's go.
Jib! Dig! Bus!
There. Right here.
Right ahead.
It's that bus.

Let's go, let's go,

Open the fucking door!
Open the fucking

You see
three little niggas

a couple stops ago?
I don't know. Lot of young
niggas get on this bus.
Don't get smart.
I'm just asking you
a motherfucking question,
all right?
Man, I don't see shit
but the road.
He's here.

Excuse my dumb-ass

What up?
Are you A.J.?
No, that's my dad.
I need to
speak to him.
It's about boys club.
Right. Right.
Uh, well, my dad's at his
office for a couple of hours.
But y'all can
hang out here
until he gets back
if you want.
Um...
No.
You know...
<i>Hey, you wanna come 'm'?
MALCOLM". Yeah.</i>
Yeah. Yeah.
Y'all come in.
You Piru?
Crenshaw Mafia?
Uh...
I'm just Malcolm.
That's your hood, though.
Right? Right?
Fuck crab-ass niggas!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.

I fuck around with it, you know.
I do my little thing.
My style is, I'm like
a Dilla meets a No l.D.
with a little bit of
splash of Rick Rubin.
Right.
Know what I mean?
I actually got something
that I did the other day.
Check this out.
<i>Yeah, ridin' in
my whip Left on Imperial</i>
<i>Hos trying to milk a nigga
Just like bereal...</i>
Wait. "Bereal"?
Yeah, what the fuck is "Bereal"?
Oh, shit. Look.
I meant "Cereal."
But that's how much I hate crab-ass niggas.
You know what I mean?
'Cause my mind,
it thinks these C-words,
but my mouth won't
let me say them.
Okay, so, you replace words
that start with C's with B's?
Like Crip dyslexia.
Criplexia.
But only soft C's, 'cause
you said "Crab" no problem.
That's true. Why won't
your mind tell your mouth
to say "Brab"
instead of "Crab"?
I don't know.
It's a case-by-case thing.
Not
"Base-by-base"?
See, you would think
this hard "C"
would be the issue,
but no.
That's interesting.
Fuck y'all. I'm just tryin'
to rep my set. That's it.
Ladera
doesn't have a set.
What the fuck you mean?
Huh? Does that make me any
less of a nigga than y'all?
No.
Because my dad was from the Bottoms.
Yeah.
My uncle, everybody on my side
reppin' the Inglewood family.
- 'Cause that's where my heart is.
- Yeah.
- Even though my... My body's right here.
Mmm-hmm.
It's cool.
It's "Bool."
Fuck all y'all.
'Cause I was in a good mood
and shit, all right.
Can't <i>bring
</i> me down Oh-ay-oh
What was that?
A song that we...
You just reminded us
of something we was writing.
"Was"? Let's...
Let's get to it.

Let's record.
Let's record what?
The song.
Quit fucking around.

If you want, you can just

Or I could have Marta
cook us up something.
Ooh! Can she cook
chili-cheese fries?
Chili-cheese fries. Yeah.
Marta! Yeah.
Right?
Where you get 'em at?
Jimmy's Burgers on Centinela

Yes, um, cuatro érdenes

Niggas, let's roll.
You coming, Malcolm?
No, I think
I'm gonna stay here.
<i>I'm your drug, baby
Come and take</i> a <i>dose of me</i>
So, you're a boy
from the hood?
Good thing you found
the boys club
and have such an amazing
mentor <i>as</i> my father.
I'm bored as fuck.
Will you play with me,
my little boy from the hood?
Yeah.
Yeah, we...
I can...
Well, what do you
want to play?
How about we play
Mother May I?
You remember
that game, right?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Ask me a question.
Um...
What's your name?
Lily.
No, you're supposed to
ask me something like,
"Mother, may I
take two steps?"
If I say yes, you take
two steps toward me.
Or I may say,
"No, you have to take
three steps back."
Now it's my turn to
ask the questions.
Okay.
Got it?
Yeah.
May I take off
my clothes?
Yeah.
Yeah.
May I walk over to you?
Yeah.
May I touch you?
Yes.
Are you a virgin?
No.
Don't.
Don't do that.
There are too many liars
and bullshitters in
this house, Malcolm.
I can tell
you're not like that.
Not like him.
Don't start now, okay?
Okay.
Yes, I'm a virgin.
I gotta pee.
Jaleel keeps rubbers
over there.
I want you ready
when I get back.
Go.
Can we get some
chili-cheese fries?
Some burgers too.
All right, we'll get...
Yo, can I get
a grilled cheese?
What the fuck is this?
We got a problem, Blood?
Listen to this motherfuckin'
Abercrombie & Fitch-ass nigga.
You little niggas were supposed

Um, I haven't fucked

Okay,.
Okay. All right.

<i>Mr. Jacoby's just
wrapping up</i> a <i>staff meeting.</i>
He'll be a few minutes.
Dom?
Is that... ls that Dom?
Oh, shit.
Austin Jacoby.
Nice to meet you,
Malcolm.
Take a seat.
Come on, relax.
So, uh,
Malcolm Adekanbi.
Did I pronounce that right?
Yeah? Great.
You're Nigerian.
My dad, um...
He... He went back to
Nigeria before I was born.
Sorry to hear that.
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.
That's why I spend
a lot of time
and a lot of money
with the boys club.
Those, uh, those kids...
Are they your kids?
Yes, they are.
Not too much older
than you.
So you know Dominique?
Excuse me?
You... You probably
know him as Dom.
No. Sorry.
Why do you ask?
Dom gave me something
to deliver to someone.
As crazy as it seems,
I think that someone is you.
This Dom person,
what did he say that
I should have to do
with this delivery?
I don't know.
I just know that he told me
to deliver it to A.J., so...
And why did you do it?
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, come on, Malcolm. Come on.
You always have a choice.
You could have done a lot of
things with that package.
You're a smart kid. I'm sure
you thought about all of them.
But you chose to make the
delivery for this Dom person...
Because you thought it was,
what, in your best interest?
So, you should
take responsibility
for the choice
that you've made.
Now, you know I'm not
the person or persons
for whom this delivery
was intended.
Something happened
along the way.
It's like, uh, Amazon.
If you order a Rick Ross
or Macklemore CD...
I would not order
a Macklemore CD.
That wouldn't happen.
All right. Who, then?
Casey Veggies.
Casey Veggies?
That's... That's an artist?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. All right.
So, you order a Casey Veggies
CD from Amazon, right?
No, you don't order
a Casey Veggies CD.
You just go online
and you download it.
Yeah, okay. All right.
But you are aware that Amazon
does ship discs, right?
And if you
order that disk
and it does not come
in a timely fashion,
you're gonna call them and you're
gonna say, "Where's my stuff?"
And Amazon has to
assume responsibility.
But it's just one CD.
But what if it's 100 orders
and 100 CDs don't show up?
Or a thousand? Or 10,000?
It's a slippery slope.
Slippery slope-
So, Amazon has got to assume
the full cost of the loss.
But most importantly,
they have to deal with the
loss of their reputation.
A reputation that has taken
a long time to build.
You understand
what I'm saying?
So let's do this.
Let's reschedule
this interview
for a few weeks from now.
Give it a little time.
Go out there.
Make the delivery for which you
have claimed responsibility
to the appropriate
consumers,
so that the suppliers
of this product can be whole.
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.
If you're able to do this,
it shows me more about you
than any interview ever could.
And I would then
make it my business
to make you a man of Harvard.
<i>I want you to get out
of the Bottoms just like I did.</i>
<i>I know from growing up there,
it's very, very dangerous.</i>
<i>And that your family
or your friends</i>
<i>could get killed
at any moment</i>
<i>just by being in the wrong
place at the wrong time.</i>
I'd hate for that
to happen to you...
<i>Or any of your family members.</i>
Getting on?
Looks like you and I had
the same kind of day.
How'd the interview go?
Okay,.
Well, sit down.
My shift's almost over.
I'll take you home.
Thanks, Mom.
<i>A junkie

<i>I'm on my way home</i>
<i>I left three days ago</i>
<i>But no one seems
to know I've gone</i>
<i>Home is where the hatred is</i>
<i>Home is filled with pain</i>
<i>And it might not be

<i>The incident took place
today at Seven Bucks coffee,</i>
<i>apparently the side effects of the
popular club drug MDMA, or "Molly."</i>
<i>Tannehill James was a witness
to this bizarre scene.</i>
<i>So, I'm here at
the Seven Bucks,</i>
<i>drinking my
vanilla chai latte,</i>
<i>and eating me
some pound cake.</i>
<i>'Cause you know niggas
don't eat scones, right?</i>
<i>When all of a sudden, this crazy
little naked ho comes up,</i>
<i>and she squatted down right in front
of me and she pissed right there.</i>
<i>I swear to God.</i>
<i>Pissed right there
for a long time.</i>
<i>So, now, you tell me how am I
supposed to eat my pound cake</i>
<i>after witnessing
something like that?</i>
<i>Reporting live,
Karen Myetta, Channel 10 news.</i>
<i>Up next,</i> a <i>fight over
lunch turns deadly in Inglewood.</i>
Did he actually say,
"I'll kill you
"and your friends if you
don't sell these drugs"?
Or just you? What?
Don't act like
you weren't curious, too.
Not directly.
He was talking about Amazon
and Rick Ross CDs not
getting to their customers.
Niggas don't even
buy CDs anymore, dawg.
Jib, that's not
the fucking point!
Are you gonna go
and sell on the corner?
'Cause we're
a bunch of bitches, man.
Speak for yourself, Jib.
Yes.
I am a bitch-ass nigga.
I don't give a fuck.
I own that shit. Who are you
trying to impress, Diggy?
We're talking about Molly,
Jib, not fucking heroin.
All we gotta do is
find the white people.
Go to Coachella, Lollapalooza.
Yeah, yeah.
We can backpack
and hitchhike
and sing
Mumford & Sons songs
and all that
folk fucking shit.
Fuck you. Okay? I'm just
saying it could work.
Yeah, yeah. Why stop there, you know?
Why not hit Bonnaroo also?
Bitcoins.
- That's how we do it.
- Do what?
Oh, shit.
There's these sites
where you can...
You can sell everything
from fake credit cards
to illegal guns and drugs.
And they use bitcoins
so they can't be traced.
We don't have to
stand on any corner.
Dark web. Could work.
Way better than Coachella.
Guys, the FBI can track us.
The police...
No, they can't.
Uh-uh.
Not if you use
a Tor browser.
What the fuck is that?
Onion routing.
Layered encryptions.
It's like a game
of Whac-a-Mole
with thousands
of computers.
What the fuck
is a Whac-a-Mole?
Look, these dark web sites
run off these
secret IP addresses.
Like LulzSec-level shady.
We need to find one somehow.

<i>Malcolm,
Jib and Diggy</i>
<i>met William at Band Camp
three years</i> ago.
Yo, if you niggas
need some weed,
I got you. Good shit.
Fair prices.
<i>William assured them
that he the used the word "Nigga"</i>
<i>only as
a term of endearment,</i>
<i>as explained by Q-Tip in the
classic song,</i> Sucka Nigga.
That's your room
right there.
<i>After that,
they all hit it Off.</i>
<i>Though he never used that word
in front of them again.</i>
<i>The mission at Band Camp was to give
kids from different backgrounds</i>
a <i>chance to exchange music and
experiences unique to their cultures.</i>
Wait. Okay, so you're saying
white girls will suck dick,
yet still claim
they're virgins?
Yeah, man.
I'm serious.
Really?
Dude, check it.
I've been getting head
since I was,
like, 12, all right?
I've been hitting hos in the
ass since I was, like, 14.
It's true, man.
These chicks will let you fill
any hole, except the pussy,
with a dick, no problem.
So, technically,
you're still a virgin too.
Yeah.
Right.
But here's something to
wrap your brain around, man.
I've never had intercourse
with a pussy.
Mmm-hmm.
Only asshole and oral.
Okay? JIB: Mmm-hmm.
So the question isn't,
"Am I technically a virgin?"
What the question
could be is,
"Am I technically gay?"
Oh. That's deep, nigga.
Yeah. I don't know.
<i>William went
to prep school,</i>
<i>where he smoked a pound of
weed a week, skipped classes,</i>
<i>and had a 1.9 GPA,</i>
<i>yet got a perfect
score on his SAT.</i>
<i>He was accepted to his father's
almamater under academic probation,</i>
<i>which meant he had to maintain
a 3.0 grade point average.</i>
<i>So, William hacked
into the database,</i>
<i>erasing all grades from the
entire freshman class.</i>
We out
Small-batch, craft-brewed,
40-ounce malt liquor.
<i>It ain't
nothin' like that</i>
tha same year,
he archieved his dream
<i>of having sex
with a black girl.</i>
You ever fucked
on Molly before?
No.
Hey, nah,
it's good, man.
It's like... It's like
being fucked by God.
<i>I'm no joke
when I stroke for</i> a <i>client</i>
You know, everybody is going
to Black Market Reloaded
and a bunch of
smaller sites.
But, dude, that shit is
getting mad sketchy now.
If you nigga...
If you guys want drugs,
I can get you good shit
way less expensive
than online.
Nigga, we don't
need to buy anything.
We need to set up

What? Nah, really, dude.
What can I get you, man?
I'm dead-ass

Dead-ass serious.
Okay,.
Okay.
All right. Wait.
'Cause this is

Why the fuck,

Yo, look, we already
went over this.

the shit out of you again.
I don't want to do that.
See, that's not even right.
I mean, like, really.
You know I'm not the one, all right?
This is all love here.
Look, let's...
Let's get back.
Hey, you asked me to
do something for you.
I'm like, "What?" I'm down.
I don't give a fuck.
Because you're my people,
all right? You're my n...
And this is where
I would insert that word.
It's nothing personal.
You're still my nigga.
But I gotta slap the shit out
of you based on principle.
Let's get back to what's goin' on.
No, no, no. Wait. Principle?
Okay, you want
to talk principle.
What about Jib here, man?
This dude isn't
African-American.
He's like fucking Latino
or Moroccan or some shit.
Where's this
conversation going?
Technically, he shouldn't
be able to say the word.
Why can he use it? Okay.
Because I'm 14% African.
Four... 14?
That doesn't...
Shit, I'm probably 14%.
I am 14% African.
Ancestry.com.
Look, we don't give a fuck.
For real? Just say the
damn word, okay?
It doesn't matter.
It's cool, right?
- I don't give a shit.
- I give a fuck.
Don't say that shit. I will
slap the shit out of you.
No, no, no. No, you won't
because you have been
outvoted by your peers.
I'm George W. Bush. I don't
give a fuck what the vote says.
Dig.
What the fuck?
Let him say it.
All right, you can say it.
Thank you.
And I appreciate that.
I really do.
Now, like a nigga
was saying...
What the fuck!
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Yo, it was a reflex.
Reflex? A fuckin' reflex? Dig!
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry.
Look. Will, we need your
help to sell this shit.
That's why we're here.
Whoa. How did
you guys get this?
It's a long story, man.
We need to know if
you're gonna help us.
Why? I mean, you guys could set
that type of shit up easily.
Nah, nigga, not like you.
Okay?
I need to go ghost. None of
this shit can point back to me.
The type of protection I need for
this shit requires a hacker.
Anon shit.
You broke into
the fucking USC database.
Hey, hey. No,
no, no. Okay?
Samo did that. I don't
know shit, all right?
Whatever, nigga.
Look, we don't know
shit about selling dope.
Nothing.
Nothing about the units,
the terminology,
the pricing.
None of that shit.
I don't even know how much
this fucking bag is worth.
You do.
Okay,.
But if this is
a Samo-type job,
man, I can't just
do this as a favor.
What do you want? A
percentage of the profits?
<i>Fuck that.</i>
Pay me in Molly.
<i>Slam!</i>
Cut up the shit. You're gonna
want to measure it out...
So you can bag it up in
grams, sell it that way.
But, you know,
what a lot of the kids
are liking nowadays
is the pill form.
<i>Da-duh-duh
Let the boys be boys</i>
<i>Slam, da-duh-duh
Da-duh-duh</i>
So, where we
setting up shop?
Here.
Here?
Yeah. Here.
Are you fuckin'
retarded?
No. It's actually
genius, bro.
<i>We have</i>
a <i>science lab.</i>
We want to enter the
Google Science Fair.
All we need you to do
is open up the science labs,
and we can do
everything else.
Don't lose
that shit, okay?
<i>We have a computer
lab which nobody ever uses.</i>
<i>I'm eating good</i>
<i>Can't bring me down</i>
<i>And all the supplies
laying around the band room</i>
<i>would be perfect
for shipping.</i>
Can't <i>bring</i> me down
And the best part,
watch.
<i>Can't
bring me down</i>
Oh-ee-oh
<i>But not them
probably black on the outside</i>
<i>White in the middle</i>
<i>I want to feel love
I want to just giggle</i>
Nobody's going to
suspect a thing.
We're just geeks
doing what geeks do.
<i>I'm eating good</i>
Right? That's what
I'm saying, bro.
You're into it, bro.
<i>Can't bring me down</i>
<i>What's up?</i>
Yo.
What's up?
<i>Hey, congratulations
on getting the store set up.</i>
<i>Now, uh, we gotta get you
guys some customers, right?</i>
Yeah.
<i>Check it out.
My house is having a party.</i>
<i>We could use a cool band.</i>
<i>Who the jiggy nigga
with the gold links?</i>
Okay. Say we're, like...
Vvhat about if you're
quoting, like, rap lyrics?
<i>Say we're</i> all <i>listening</i>
to <i>The Chronic, Doggystyle.</i>
We're all rapping along.
Like, what are we
supposed to say?
<i>'Cause I never hesitate
to put an N-word on his back</i>
I'm sorry. That's bullshit, dude.
Yes.
What about
the artist's intent?
Dude, that is exactly
what I'm talking about, man.
Dude, I saw your bitch,
Lily, on YouTube.
Okay. Well, Lily is not
my bitch anymore, so...
Hey, then can I
get at her, dude?
'Cause I gotta find out
what she was on.
Nigga, I don't give
a fuck. All right?
Go for it, dude. Hey, but for
real, she was using this.

<i>Lily, dude, that

Principal Harris
tells me that
there are
three young men...
who actually joined
the Google Science Fair.
Please.
Proof
that the public school system
is still a ladder to success.
Half an ounce
for Joe Patterson.
We have an ounce
for John Smith.
We have an eighth
for Ashley Down.
- Susan Thompson.
- Steve Burke.
<i>Yeah, this popped up
about</i> a <i>few weeks ago.</i>
Look at what
they're moving.
It's major volume, too.
I don't know why they're
calling it "Lily."
Maybe, uh, 2 Chainz
called it that on a mixtape.
He's a rapper. Yeah, you
know, the Birthday Song-
"Big booty ho."
Okay, never mind.
Forget it.
Hi.
Um, is that offer
still on the table?
Help.
If you're busy, loan come
back tomorrow or later.
No, um, no. They're...
They're about to leave.
Yeah. Yeah,
we were stepping.
Okay, cool. Thanks.
Bye. Bye, guys.
Have fun.
<i>They say
one door open</i>
<i>When another door close</i>
<i>I'm prayin' That's
the way that it goes</i>
<i>'Cause right
when I'm about to</i>
<i>Turn the doorknob</i>
Thanks for helping me.
No problem.
You're a fast learner.
Aw.
Thanks.
Shit's been real crazy
since Dom got locked up.
A few of his boys got smoked
on the corner the other day.
I don't want
to go back there.
Sorry. I just don't
have people
I can talk to
about this stuff,
that understand,
you know?
I know.
Thanks.
Dom called from jail
the other day.
He asked about you.
That's why you showed up
all of a sudden.
What's that
supposed to mean?
It means that Dom sent you
here <i>as</i> his messenger.
All this crying on
my shoulder? Bullshit.
You're supposed to put
your feminine wiles on me,
and find out about
the fucking dope.
Right?
Right?
Wait. I...
And here I was,
stupid enough to think that you were
different than these other niggas.
Nakia, Nakia, Nakia.
FUCK you!
"Feminine wiles"?
<i>Good</i> morning.
Today you're going to
take the SAT.
The SAT is your chance to show how
prepared you are for college.
You will have 25 minutes
to work on section one.
Yo, what the fuck was that?
What do you mean,
you don't know?
Drug search, dawg.
They do it randomly,
like, every month or so.
It's all for show.
I mean, it's not like
somebody is stupid enough
to put some shit
in their locker.
Can I go to the bathroom?
Yes, but you will
not be given more time.
<i>Without</i> a
<i>pause, I'm lowering my level</i>
<i>The hard rhymer
where you never been I'm in</i>
<i>You want styling
You know it's time again</i>
<i>"D" the enemy
Telling you to hear it</i>
<i>They praised the music
This time they play the lyrics</i>
<i>Some say no
to the album, the show</i>
<i>Hey, yo, Chuck</i>
<i>They think we takin' shorts</i>
<i>Show 'em This is cold medina,
man come on, kick it</i>
Terminator X
<i>Terminator X</i>
<i>Terminator X</i>
Man.
Come on, man.
What in the hell
are you doing?
Um, SAT's.
SAT's?
I, uh, had to use
the restroom,
and I'm kind of late
getting back.
You know?
Thank you.
Good luck, little man.
<i>Bring that beat back!
One, two, three, four!</i>
<i>Hit it!
The set ain't over!</i>
<i>Come on, y'all
Let's get busy</i>
<i>Come on. Say "Yeah!"</i>
<i>Say "Hell yeah!"</i>
<i>Ain't it funky?</i>
<i>I'm not doing
this shit no more.</i>
Bro, I can
fix this shit.
I can
fix this shit.
The bag is almost done.
The shit is almost gone.
I mean, I can't sell
this shit no more.
We almost just got
fucking caught.
Look, I don't want
to go to jail.
I want to go to
fucking college.
I want to get a good job.
I want to help my mom!
Dig?
That's cool.
It's my fault,
my weight to carry.
Yo, that's bullshit.
We all wanted to go to Dom's party.
Especially you, Jib.
It's our weight
to carry too.
We've got your back
to the end, right?
Right?
Fuck.
There it is.
<i>Gracias.</i>
All right, so, when we get
the bitcoins, then what?
I need cash.
Well, you would have to do
a currency exchange
to get the US dollar
equivalent,
but, I mean...
That kind of
defeats the purpose
of a non-fiat currency,
right?
Okay, see, I don't give
a fuck about all that
Aaron Swartz
Occupy Wall Street shit.
Okay, well,
you'd have to link
your Bitcoin account
to a bank account,
and then there's this
infinitesimally small chance
that it could be traced.
I mean, the Feds
would have to know
exactly what they're
looking for, you know.
It's not something they could
just stumble upon randomly.
Basically, I would
just have to make
a stupid-ass mistake
for them to trace it.
And do I look like
the type of nigga
that makes
stupid-ass mistakes?
Um...
So, uh, you want me to
set up that exchange?
I'm... I'm good.
I'll do it.
Um...
What if I want
zero chances of trace?
Well...
If you want zero trace,
you gotta go
black market, homey.
<i>Yeah, you got to put
the bitcoins on</i> a <i>drive.</i>
<i>And make
a hand-to-hand exchange.</i>
<i>You get cash minus
the transaction fee.</i>
<i>If you really want
to go that route,</i>
<i>and I really
don't suggest it,</i>
<i>I know a dude in
the garment district.</i>
<i>Ask for Fidel.</i>
<i>If you pass his test,
he'll help you.</i>
<i>If you don't...</i>
<i>Well, just pass his test.</i>
One of these Alligator bags
was made here.
One is from the store.
Which one is which?
The right one,
I mean, 'cause it's...
Poofier. They both
look the same.
The reality is,
I sell 90% of my stuff
to white hos.
Most aren't rich enough
to afford retail.
Why do you think that is?
I don't know.
They know.
They know the only difference
between these two bags
is the person rocking them.
So, when they rock 'em,
people are gonna
assume it's real.
And the flip of that is,
it doesn't matter if
you had the receipt
from Barneys
sewn into the bag.
People gonna assume it's fake.
Only you know the truth.
So, what are you, man?
Are you a real?
Are you a fake?
That's what I need
to find out.
I'm just Malcolm.
"Just Malcolm"?
Who the fuck is Malcolm?
Show me. I want you to hit
me <i>as</i> hard as you can.
Hey! Don't look at them.
This is between you and me.
I'm-a give you
five seconds.
You can either man up or run out
like the little bitch you is.
One!
Malcolm, let's just go.
Listen to your
friends, boy. Two!
You can't be serious.
I'm more than serious,
motherfucker.
Three!
I need that money.
You ain't gettin' shit.
Four!
Yeah, you see your
pussy friends leaving?
They're running like
some little bitches.
Run, PUSSY-
Five! Five! Five!
Hit me, man!
Five, motherfuck...
Oh, man. You...
Drive.
Where?
Give me the drive!
Shit.
Come here, man.
Now I know who you are.
A man that does not
give a fuck.
Hey, Blood! Don't you owe
me another shoe, nigga?
Shit!
Get on the ground,
bitch-ass nigga.
- Get the fuck off me!
- Malcolm!
Get off us! Malcolm!
Stay the fuck down, nigga.
Malcolm!
Bitch, nigga. Yeah.
Yeah!
Jib,
get the fucking bag.
Come on!
Oh, shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hold on.
Give me the bag.
Please,
just give me the bag.
I don't even want
that shit, Blood.
Let's go, nigga.
All right. Come on.
We out, we out, we out.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
Let's go.
That's 10%.
Consider it a proffer.
The rest is in
a Bitcoin account.
Bitcoin?
It's an untraceable
internet currency.
There are web sites
that sell a lot of things
that people would get
in trouble for selling.
They use bitcoins.
Kind of like Amazon.
So you sold on the Internet?
No.
No. You did.
Excuse me?
You set up a store on
Black Market Reloaded.
Very successful.
Very successful.
I mean, you moved
your entire inventory.
See, the market's
been pretty volatile,
but <i>as</i> of right now, you
have $97,267 and 31 cents
in your Bitcoin
exchange account.
$10,000 in cash.
Now, as long as your bitcoins
stay in the exchange account,
they're safe, untraceable.
Now, if you were to exchange
the bitcoins into dollars
and transfer that money into your
Jacoby Check Cashing corporate account,
there would be a really, really
small chance of it getting traced
by the DEA or FBI.
I mean, that would only happen
if you were idiotically sloppy
while setting up the
Bitcoin exchange account.
So, uh, you want me to
set up that exchange?
I'm good. I'll do it.
I mean, that...
I mean, it would
almost have to be...
Intentional.
And why should I believe
any of this, Malcolm?
Is your Jacoby APS
shipping account number
<i>5x4578?</i>
<i>California regional
bank number 267856783?</i>
Federal tax id 95...
Hey, you really should just
upgrade your firewall, you know?
I actually know a guy.
He's kind of familiar
with your system already.
You're all out of
toilet paper, hon.
Courtside, okay?
Courtside.
Gotta have it.
No, come on.
Now, what if I report
to the authorities
that my securities
have been breached
and my identity
has been stolen?
As I've just learned, it doesn't
matter if this bag is real or fake.
Because of where
I come from,
everybody's going
to assume it's fake.
So, since you and I come
from the same place,
what is the DEA going
to assume about you?
And because you and I are
from the same place, Malcolm,
you should know
what a person like me
can do to a person
like you.
Yeah.
But that's not what
a Harvard man would do.
Nah, see, a man of Harvard
is smart enough to see
that would set off
a chain of events
that would inevitably come
back and destroy him.
<i>And everything he's built.</i>
<i>That would be a shame.</i>
So, I think you should take this
opportunity before you very seriously.
Do everything in your power
to ensure that I become
a man of Harvard,
and make sure nothing happens
to a hair on my gorgeous head.
Can you dig it?
<i>I'm eating good
Can't bring me down</i>
<i>Can't bring me down
Can't bring me down</i>
Malcolm, you forgot your bag.
It's fake.
Malcolm.
You're pretty damn arrogant.
You think you're gonna
get into Harvard?
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>
Let me tell you
about two students.
<i>Student "A"
is</i> a <i>straight-A student</i>
<i>who lives in the suburbs
of Los Angeles.</i>
<i>He plays in a punk band
with his best friends.</i>
<i>He loves to skateboard
and ride on his BMX bike.</i>
<i>His favorite TV show
is Game of Thrones</i>
<i>and his favorite band
is The Thermals.</i>
<i>He's a '90s hip-hop geek.</i>
<i>Student "B" goes to
an underfunded school,</i>
<i>where teachers who would
rather not be there</i>
<i>teach kids
who really don't care.</i>
<i>He lives with
a single mother,</i>
<i>doesn't know his father
and has sold dope.</i>
<i>Now close your eyes.</i>
<i>Picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see.</i>
<i>Be honest. No one's
going to judge you.</i>
<i>Now open your eyes.</i>
So, am I student
"A" or student "B"?
Am I a geek or a menace?
For most of my life, I've been
caught in between who I really am
and how I'm perceived,
in between categories
and definition.
I don't fit in.
And I used to think that
that was a curse,
but now I'm slowly
starting to see
maybe it's a blessing.
See, when you don't fit in,
you're forced to see the world
from many different angles
and points of view.
You gain knowledge,
life lessons
from disparate people
and places.
And those lessons, for better
or worse, have shaped me.
So, who am I?
Allow me to
reintroduce myself.
My name is
Malcolm Adekanbi.
I'm a straight-A student
with nearly perfect
SAT scores.
I taught myself how to play
guitar and read music.
I have stellar
recommendations
and diverse
extra-curricular activities.
I am a Google
Science Fair participant,
and in three weeks,
I helped make
over $100,000 for
an online business.
So, why do I want
to attend Harvard?
If I was white, would you even
have to ask me that question?
<i>It's my
turn now It's my turn now</i>
<i>This might burn now
It's my world now</i>
<i>It's my turn now
It's my turn now</i>
<i>This might burn now
It's my world now</i>
<i>It's my turn now
This might burn now</i>
<i>It's my turn now</i>
<i>How come
you don't hear me, ma?</i>
<i>Tell me where
your hearing went</i>
<i>How are you just
going to leave me</i>
<i>In this social experiment?</i>
<i>Wonder why we
take these pills</i>
<i>Everything we want is sick</i>
<i>Heart is like a toilet bowl</i>
<i>Mama, I want so much shit</i>
<i>Young, black, and I want
that dreams of Americana</i>
<i>The girl I like
want niggas to buy</i>
<i>So sorry, Mama, but I want
to till 6:00 in the morning</i>
<i>Ain't rolling with no army</i>
<i>And I've got that
ping-ping on me</i>
<i>Dreams like my money, mommy
Can't take it from me, mommy</i>
<i>I've been waiting
in the dark here all night</i>
<i>Waiting for some inspiration
to pass by</i>
<i>Got my head straight
and finally my vibe's right</i>
<i>But that don't concern you
It's my turn now</i>
<i>It's my turn now
This might burn now</i>
<i>It's my world now
It's my turn now</i>
<i>It's my turn now
This might burn now</i>
<i>It's my world now
It's my turn now</i>
Nice haircut.
I like it.
I'm... I'm sorry
for all the stuff
that I said.
There was a lot
going on at the time.
And that wasn't me.
Yeah, it was.
You might have all these other
folks fooled, but not me.
You're...
Complicated.
Anyway, I just came by
to say thank you.
Thank you?
You... You passed?
Mmm-hmm.
You passed.
You were supposed to go
to prom with me.
No.
I told you I wasn't mad
about missing prom.
<i>HEY-</i>
I was mad about
missing Six Flags.
I'll pick you up
in the morning.
<i>It's my
turn now It's my turn now</i>
<i>This might burn now
It's my world now</i>
<i>It's my turn now</i>
<i>Oh, do me, baby</i>
<i>Oh, do me, baby</i>

Yes, sir</i>
<i>I want the everydays to know
Come on</i>
<i>Even though I'm one of
their kind Yes, sir</i>
<i>And this encounter is close
Come on</i>
<i>I'm-a lay it down on
the line Yes, sir</i>
<i>Till I'm eternally a ghost
Come on</i>
<i>The opportunity is to dine
Yes, sir</i>
<i>So right now It just

<i>Watch how a nigga destroy
Come on</i>
<i>Life is surrounded by signs
Yes, sir</i>

it difficult Come on</i>
<i>Nothin' in their life
ever rhymes Yes, sir</i>
<i>And then they wonder why
they never grow Come on</i>
<i>They would rather grow
like vines Yes, sir</i>
<i>Six seconds, then they go
Come on</i>
<i>But I would rather
be a bonsai Yes, sir</i>
<i>And then never grow with
the flow and tell them</i>
<i>Come on</i>
<i>I'm eating good</i>
<i>Can't bring me down</i>
<i>I'm in a good mood</i>
<i>Can't bring me down</i>
<i>Awreeoh

<i>Sure to blow,
but not them probably</i>
<i>Black on the outside,
white in the middle</i>
<i>I want to feel love
I want to just giggle</i>
<i>About this world
The bullshit in front of it</i>
<i>Make a nigga just
want to get steamrolled</i>
<i>Steamrolled</i>
<i>Everybody say "Steamrolled"</i>
<i>Steamrolled</i>
<i>Oh, man, I'm rollin',
rollin', rollin', rollin'</i>
<i>I'm rollin',
rollin', rollin', rollin'</i>
<i>I'm grin din ',
I'm bitin' down</i>
<i>I'm grindin'
to light and sound</i>
<i>And I'm grindin'
It's tightenin' now</i>
<i>And I'm signin'
Because I'm bright and loud</i>
<i>I'm feelin' good</i>
<i>Can't bring me down</i>
<i>I'm in a good mood</i>
<i>Can't bring me down</i>
