Yes. That's right.
The whole court is in turmoil.
Couldn't have happened
at a more inconvenient time.
No, Dan doesn't know.
That's why I'm calling you. I've got
to get through to him right away.
- Just a moment.
- Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.
- This is the file you asked for.
- Oh, yeah.
Thank God I caught you, Christine.
Have you any idea where he went?
What makes you think I'd
know where he is? Dan?
Dan?
No, he's not here. I just walked
through the door, C.J.
- <i>Oh? Where have you been?</i>
- Europe, as usual.
Stanley left some instructions that
involve Dan, and I've got to find him.
He surprised the hell out of me in
Brussels. He sent me a postcard.
The only part I can make out is
"Dear Christine".
At least I think that's "dear".
You know what his handwriting is like.
And then there's something
here about climbing a mountain.
Did he happen to
mention which mountain?
See that peak straight ahead?
That's where we'll be
tomorrow at this time.
Grab a couple of lungs full of this.
Pity the poor bastards in the cities
who don't get to taste
real air anymore.
Can we take a rest?
Another 30 minutes.
I know a great place for lunch.
Just hold on. I'm looking for it.
- "D. Snow". Would that be it?
- <i>That's it.</i>
Mr. Snow is a justice of the
United States Supreme Court.
Do you have a number there?
I do. I do indeed.
Area code, 202-252-3271.
- Hello? Do you read? Over.
- <i>Yes, I read you.</i>
Press the button to talk.
The little one on the top
with your thumb. There.
Hello, hello. Come in, please.
Come in, please.
Dan?
<i>Hold on, Washington. I'm patching</i>
<i>you through on another channel.</i>
- <i>Go ahead, Highport.</i>
- <i>Do you hear me there? Hello?</i>
- Dan Snow here. Is that you, C.J.?
- We need you back here, Dan.
Couldn't hear that. Say it again,
will you, C.J.?
<i>Stanley Moorehead</i>
<i>died this morning.</i>
Are you still there, Dan?
I say, Stanley Moorehead
died this morning.
- I'm still here. I heard you.
- You gotta press to talk.
Heard you, C.J. Tell Alice I'm sorry.
Well, how fast can you get back here?
You see, Stanley asked if you...
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Hello, Jeff?
Up here, CB patches
pick up a lot of DX noise.
- You want me to try to get him again?
- No. We'll be getting down the hill.
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.
I don't really know...
When Stanley left instructions
that he wanted me to...
What do you call it?
Say a few words. I was surprised.
Mr. Justice Moorehead and I disagreed
on upon a lot of things in our lifetimes,
and I guess it's only natural that
we'd keep right on disagreeing.
I know seven other men
who could do this better,
but I'm not about to file
a dissenting opinion.
Stanley Moorehead was
a gentleman of honest mind.
You can't say that about many
men in this city, in this century.
Stanley and I were like
a pair of flying buttresses.
Leaning on opposite
sides of a Gothic cathedral,
we helped keep the
roof from caving in.
If we'd been on the
same side all the time,
we might have pushed
the building over.
Don't have to agree with a man
in order to respect him.
Stanley and I had one argument
over and over again.
I never won it. I never could win.
He used to ask me,
"What in God's name is the practical
use of mountain climbing?"
One time I said to him,
"Well, on a mountaintop, maybe
you're a little bit closer to God."
He laughed and said, "Dan, what
the hell do you know about God?"
I do know this.
Mr. Justice Stanley Moorehead is not
in a box about to be covered by earth.
He's at the top of a mountain,
higher than I have ever climbed.
Fire!
Ready! Aim! Fire!
Ready! Aim! Fire!
Ready! Present arms.
We should've hired
a limousine like the others.
Nonsense, the fresh
air will do you good.
- Alice looked awful.
- Know what burns me?
Today's <i>Star</i> brushed
off Stanley's life
with 2 inches and printed two
full pages of smart-ass speculation
- about his replacement.
- Been a terrible ordeal for her.
I bet it's a surprise,
somebody nobody thought of.
- She doesn't have many close friends.
- It's always a surprise.
Especially to the guy
who gets tapped.
Maybe I'll plan a dinner party
for her after a week or so.
President gave me the nod, I was
so surprised I couldn't talk.
I don't think I could stand one of
those teas, with all those wives.
Could be anybody. Lot of good
men around. Lot of lousy ones too.
If I were Alice, I'd go to Europe,
the warm part.
- How was Europe?
- Wet.
- How was your mountain?
- High.
You have any idea who's
gonna be appointed?
- To what?
- The court.
I never try to second-guess
a president.
Man moves into the White House,
you have no idea what
happens to his mind.
I just hope he has an active
membership card in the human race.
- Waldo.
- Hey, Dan.
Feels like the first day
of school, doesn't it?
- Hope I never graduate.
- Don't know what we'd do without you.
Morning, Radabaugh.
Anything happen?
All that's happened is on
your desk, Mr. Justice Snow.
- Still got the same cold?
- Sinus.
Who's that?
Mason Woods, sir.
May I come in, sir?
Of course. What the hell do
you think you're here for?
Thank you, sir.
Don't knock. It's highly unlikely
you'll ever catch me
on the couch with
Miss Radabaugh.
Yes, sir.
Well, we got one complaint about you.
You're too goddamn polite.
And stop being scared of me, Mason.
You got the job.
Yes, sir. Would you care for some tea,
Mr. Justice, or a Scotch?
Maybe I'd better have both. No, I don't
wanna overdo it. Forget the tea.
Yes, sir.
Now, this supports your position
on <i>Abbott v. Omnitech</i>.
Forget Omnitech.
But it's at the top of the order list.
- It's gonna get struck.
- Why?
My brave brethren on the court
are too chicken-hearted to hear it.
That's why. When I'm getting
ripped off, Mason,
I want to know who's doing the ripping.
How much can these multinational
monsters get away with?
I don't know. Neither do you,
because they hide
behind all those TV commercials,
saying how goddamn holy they are.
Even the C.J. Is scared
to hear Omnitech.
He says, "It's like telling God
you wanna examine the books."
Peace, up to a point.
Mason, the most dangerous
thing in the world is to be cautious.
People who fall down are the
ones who are afraid they'll trip.
- Take a chance.
- Yes, sir.
And don't always agree.
If you think I'm wrong and don't say so,
then what the hell good are you?
I like law clerks who argue with me.
Yes, sir. No, sir.
I mean, I'll try to do that, sir.
Not to do that, sir.
- What's this?
- <i>Collins v. California</i>, the kinky one
from the 9th Circuit, the Berkeley
student who wore a T-shirt that said
"Fuck the White House".
- Did he have his pants off?
- It doesn't say.
I don't see any clear and
present danger that he intended
to implement the opinion
of his T-shirt.
The 9th Circuit held it was
offensive to public sensibility.
Just being offensive
is not an offense.
One man's pornography
may be another man's poetry.
Yes, sir.
Yes, yes, yes. Lady Purity, speaking
from the cloisters of California.
"Free speech is not, ipso facto,
filthy speech.
"Dirt is a splendid
environment for earthworms,
"but it is a grave for
the human mind."
I wish to hell she didn't
write so goddamn well.
You see, Mason, that's what
this court is for,
to restrain the Ruth Loomises
of the world.
Sir, I found this opinion
on surveillance,
but you won't have to read it.
- Why not?
- You wrote it.
Well, read it to me. I might have
forgotten it or changed my mind.
"When God created the world,
"he did it alone, in private,
all by himself.
"No monitors,
no hidden microphones.
"He made it how he wanted, but what
if someone invaded God's privacy?
"Would he have put the world
together the same way? I doubt it.
"He would've made it a popular
world, and the Garden of Eden
"would have turned out like
Las Vegas or 42nd Street."
- Would you like to take any calls, sir?
- Miss Radabaugh will get that.
No, she won't. Chambers of Mr.
Justice Snow. Oh, yes, Mrs. Snow.
It's your wife, but she
doesn't want to bother you.
You're interrupting me,
but you're not bothering me.
<i>How should I seat them</i>
<i>this evening?</i>
I don't care how you seat them.
Try chairs.
Hello? Hello?
- What happened to Radabaugh?
- She left early.
- Sinus?
- She looked terrible.
Radabaugh's been with me for 23
years, and she always looks terrible.
- How do you do that, sir?
- Do what?
Reach in there and find what you're
looking for in the middle of all that...
Mess? To you, it's a mess. To me,
it's a wilderness of free association.
Don't ever straighten up my desk.
I'd never be able to find anything.
I've always been
suspicious of neatness.
If there's nothing on top
of a man's desk,
he probably shoved all
the clutter into the drawers.
And if his drawers are empty, what
the hell does he need a desk for?
- May I come in, Dan?
- Sure, C.J.
- How are you, Mr. Chief Justice?
- I'm not sure.
Mind if I lie down on your couch?
Mason. See if those T-shirts
are available on the open market.
- I'd like to wear one under my robes.
- What T-shirts?
None of your goddamn business.
Do I ask you about your underwear?
Hey, how come your couch is so
much more comfortable than mine?
You know something, C.J.?
Maybe I'll give you that couch
as a going-away present.
Who's going away?
Think of how many people would
bust a gut with joy if I retired.
You wouldn't do that to me, Dan.
I won't quit when you're
short-handed.
I'll wait until you got nine
men on the bench again.
Yeah.
Who's the president going to pick?
He's already been appointed?
Who is he?
Mr. Justice Snow, I'm going to have
to ask you to rephrase that question.
A woman.
He picked a woman. Great.
Good for him. It'll be fun.
Who is it? Who is she?
Who? Who?
The president has sent up to
the Senate Judiciary Committee
the name of Judge
Ruth Hagadorn Loomis
of the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals.
Get off my couch.
I have to lie down.
Now, now, Dan...
You're joking. It's a joke, isn't it?
The president, I am told, thinks he
has made a great, progressive step
in the history of mankind.
Ruth Loomis? The mother superior
of Orange County?
What goes through a man's head
when he makes an appointment
like that?
I guess he was trying
to be evenhanded,
president of all the people.
The Senate will never go for it,
will they? Will they? Forget it.
Where's Miss Radabaugh?
Chambers of Mr. Justice Snow.
It's a reporter. Any comment
for <i>The Washington Post</i>?
No comment from
Mr. Justice Snow at this time.
You're better than Miss Radabaugh.
President wants a woman on the
court, why not pick Miss Radabaugh?
She'd be perfect.
She'd never show up.
Jeff, why in God's name do I get
a sinking feeling in my gut
every time I think about that
woman sitting on this court?
It's not because she's a woman.
I like women. My wife's a woman.
The bench will smell better
with a little perfume on it.
But Ruth Loomis?
How can you just let it ring?
A telephone has no constitutional
right to be answered.
Don't pay any attention to it.
It'll go away.
See?
- I hear she plays tennis.
- Hitler played the harmonica.
Oh, she may not be so bad.
She's young.
We could use some young
blood around here.
And she isn't stupid.
Fix yourself a drink.
I just might do that.
Here she is now. Come in.
Is it true?
Jack Anderson's on the phone.
Either of you care
to say anything to him?
Ask him where I'm spending
my vacation next summer.
I don't know, but he probably does.
I'll just tell him neither of you
is available for comment.
How does a newspaperman like
Jack Anderson find out what happens
in the Oval Office so fast?
Simple. He's got a friend
in the Soviet Embassy.
And I'm ten minutes late.
Only one thing, Dan.
Before you consider resigning...
Resigning?
Who the hell is gonna resign?
You think I'd leave you here alone to
get sprayed down by the Lysol Lady
of Orange County?
If that holy junta at the White House
picked her
to replace Stanley Moorehead,
who in God's name do you suppose
they'd send up to take my seat?
Shirley Temple?
- Five-two.
- Change sides.
I'll let you take the sun for a while.
Not bad for a beginner, am I?
Let me take you someplace
where I can win.
Isn't a year long enough
to be a practicing widow?
Seven months. Don't rush me.
- Am I on the list?
- You're at the top.
<i>Judge Loomis. Telephone.</i>
<i>Long-distance call for Judge Loomis.</i>
Sorry, Bill.
I'm sorry these proceedings
are taking so much time,
but we're breaking
ground here.
I trust the committee's questions aren't
embarrassing you, Judge Loomis?
I don't embarrass easily, senator.
Judge Loomis? Judge Loomis,
about your interests and equities,
would they influence your
decisions on the high court?
The financial statement in front
of you is complete, senator.
When I was appointed to the
9th Circuit, I disposed of anything
that might raise a question
of conflict of interest.
- Thank you.
- But you were still married
to a very active and successful
corporation lawyer.
Was I expected to dispose of him?
According to this FBI report,
you and your husband were partners
in the law firm of Loomis and Loomis.
Yes. Excuse me, senator.
Why do you keep bringing
up my husband?
When I was appointed to the federal
bench, he took over the practice.
It was a tremendous burden on him.
It's probably what killed him.
Did you represent
Omnitech International
or its chairman, Donald Richards?
No, senator.
- You're sure about that?
- Quite sure.
<i>After you left, is it possible</i>
<i>the firm represented them?</i>
<i>I'd have no knowledge of that.</i>
<i>Since your husband's death, you've</i>
<i>had no contact with any firm member?</i>
<i>None. Oh, that's not quite true.</i>
<i>I do play tennis once in a while with</i>
<i>Bill Russell. That's William Russell.</i>
<i>He joined the firm</i>
<i>after I went to the bench.</i>
<i>You ever discuss legal business</i>
<i>with him?</i>
<i>No, senator.</i>
Do you think, perhaps, you're a
little too young, Judge Loomis,
to take these responsibilities
on yourself?
As I recall, Mr. Justice Snow was
a year younger than I am
when he was appointed
to the court.
Do you feel your decisions on
the high court might be influenced
by the fact that,
well, you're a woman?
I hope so. Aren't a man's decisions
influenced by the fact that he's a man?
For two centuries, this court has
expressed men's opinions.
Perhaps it's time for the majority of the
population to have one voice in nine
in the rulings
of the Supreme Court.
Is the lady implying
that male justice is perverted?
<i>Haven't we outgrown those fears</i>
<i>about the periodic instability</i>
<i>of the female of the species?</i>
<i>Eggs are not the seeds of insanity.</i>
<i>A woman can ovulate</i>
<i>and think at the same time.</i>
<i>We're striving to be objective.</i>
<i>But, really, what does sex have</i>
<i>to do with being a judge?</i>
<i>Somebody with the capacity to</i>
<i>bear children is gifted, not crippled.</i>
<i>A uterus is like absolute pitch.</i>
<i>Some people have it, some don't.</i>
Well, according to this fact sheet,
Judge Loomis has never
had any children.
Does the Constitution say a Supreme
Court justice has to be a mother?
Judge Loomis, we don't mean
to probe into your personal life.
Why not? My entire life is public.
The FBI is wrong in reporting to you
I have no children. I have hundreds.
We are the parents of our ideas.
And so my children,
in other words,
my opinions, my decisions
are the result of conception.
And the delivery
is sometimes painful.
You may not like my children.
You may find them ugly.
But, by God, your ideas and mine
have equal rights to live together.
To grow, to change, even to die.
If there are no further questions,
the committee will consider
an executive session of what it will
recommend to the Senate.
<i>Thank you, Judge Loomis.</i>
<i>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</i>
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>
Now let's check it just once more.
Mr. Justice Carey is now on this end.
- That's correct.
- And Mr. Justice Webb?
- Webb.
- Mr. Justice Quincy?
- That's him.
- Mr. Justice Snow?
- That's right.
- The C.J. Stays in the center.
- And then Mr. Justice Halperin.
- OK.
- Mr. Justice Clewes?
- That's him.
- Mr. Justice Thompson?
- That's right.
And the new chair for
Justice Loomis on this end.
That's correct.
Does the lady need this?
We'll tell her it's a wastebasket.
- Good afternoon.
- Welcome to Washington.
- Thank you.
- Everything's ready.
- Great. Is the phone in?
- Yes. The man left an hour ago.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Hello?
- Ready for your coronation?
- <i>Bill?</i>
- Yes.
How did you get this number?
I don't even know it.
<i>I do. If it ever slips your mind,</i>
<i>give me a ring.</i>
- In the bedroom, please.
- In the bedroom?
I'm talking to the bellman, you idiot.
- It's sweet of you to call.
- <i>I wanted to be the first man</i>
<i>in history to ask</i>
<i>a Supreme Court justice for a date.</i>
So noted. The clerk will
put it on the docket.
- <i>That'll take two years.</i>
- Not now that I'm in charge.
- Mr. Agronsky.
- Yeah?
Whenever you're ready.
Tape is rolling.
This is a historic day for the nation
and for the Supreme Court
of the United States.
The court has been in session
since the first Monday in October,
which, according to the
Judiciary Act of 1789,
marks the start of a
new term each year.
<i>No camera has ever photographed</i>
<i>the traditional robing ceremony</i>
<i>in the sanctum sanctorum</i>
<i>of the court,</i>
<i>and none is there today.</i>
<i>Since the death of</i>
<i>Justice Stanley Moorehead,</i>
<i>this has been an eight-man court,</i>
<i>which, as Justice Daniel Snow</i>
<i>has pointed out,</i>
<i>resembles a four-man</i>
<i>basketball team.</i>
- <i>Today, the vacancy is filled.</i>
- How are you?
- <i>But this remains an eight-man court.</i>
- Well, where is she?
Maybe we ought to sound
the warning buzzer sooner.
I suppose she has
things to do that we don't.
After all, I don't have anything
to do with my hair.
This is an historic occasion.
Like the Jesuits going coed.
Suppose she'll want to hang chintz
curtains everywhere? I hate chintz.
Why am I nervous?
She should be nervous.
Things aren't going to
be different from the way
they've been every
two minutes to ten in court history.
We've got to think of her
as one of the brothers.
Good morning.
Justice Loomis, welcome.
Welcome to the court.
- Thank you. Good morning.
- Nice to have you with us.
Thank you for the lovely roses.
You don't send me roses
anymore, C.J.
It's 9:58, gentlemen
and Madame Justice.
We shake hands like this every day,
just before we take the bench.
Like nine boxers coming into a ring.
We shake hands before
we knock each other out.
The honorable, the chief justice
and the associate justices
of the Supreme Court
of the United States.
Oyez, oyez, oyez.
All persons having business
before the honorable,
the Supreme Court
of the United States,
are admonished to draw near
and give their attention,
for the court is now sitting.
God save the United States
and this honorable court.
Today's orders of the court have
been certified by the chief justice,
filed with the clerk and
will not be announced orally.
Probably the peak of
every lawyer's career
is that moment when he
is presented and accredited
to plead before the
highest court in the land.
Only lawyers ever plead
in that hallowed chamber.
<i>But today, all eyes are focused</i>
<i>on the court's newest newcomer,</i>
<i>who has just received confirmation</i>
<i>from the Senate of the United States.</i>
<i>Court watchers will be fascinated</i>
<i>in the weeks and months ahead</i>
<i>by the figure in the leather chair</i>
<i>farthest to the left of the chief justice.</i>
<i>How will this feminine presence</i>
<i>affect</i>
<i>what, for two centuries, has</i>
<i>been an all-male preserve?</i>
Because so many states have
accepted pornography as a way of life
does not mean that we are willing
to compromise our values
in the sovereign state of Nebraska.
Ergo, I beseech
this distinguished body,
in its infinite and scholarly wisdom,
to uphold the exalted
standards of morality
which this lofty court
so fervently advocates.
And how rare it is to find
judicial minds
so attuned to the higher
reaches of the spirit,
so understanding of the basic
values we so dearly cherish,
so incredibly sensitive
to the deep strains of decency,
which constitute the lapping
tidewaters of our heritage?
The state of Nebraska contends
that Herbert G. Maloney
knowing and willfully
perpetrated an obscene and foul...
Your time is up.
- May I be permitted...?
- No.
Any questions, gentlemen?
Madame Justice?
I get the impression that the state
of Nebraska would like to see this film
confiscated, burned
and the ashes sent into space.
Is that the idea?
If the court so recommended.
Is it your contention
that the Constitution gives
this court any such power?
This court is the judge
of its own power.
Until we actually examine
the film in question, I think...
May it please the court,
I respectfully submit that my client's
rights under the First Amendment...
The First Amendment
doesn't give anybody the right
to commit acts which are harmful
to the public good.
But this is an educational film.
A major documentary,
a work of art.
How can we judge that
until we've seen it?
Do any of the justices object,
besides Justice Snow?
I think it's essential
that we see the film.
Then the clerk will schedule a showing
of the film at some future date
which is not in conflict with the
schedule already on the calendar.
<i>If you saw Lois walking along</i>
<i>in the sunshine of Beverly Hills,</i>
<i>you might think she was just</i>
<i>a healthy, ordinary girl,</i>
<i>but Lois has a problem.</i>
<i>Like the alcoholic</i>
<i>who cannot stop with one drink,</i>
<i>like the compulsive eater who must</i>
<i>consume one dessert after another,</i>
<i>Lois can never be satisfied,</i>
<i>can never get enough</i>
<i>of what she craves.</i>
- Why isn't Mr. Justice Snow here?
- He never comes to these showings.
<i>The average young woman wants</i>
<i>one man, but Lois is insatiable.</i>
- Have we missed much?
- The lady's just getting started.
You guys get over there.
And shut the door.
<i>We asked a distinguished physician</i>
<i>to give his opinion of Lois' condition.</i>
<i>He has asked</i>
<i>that his name be withheld</i>
<i>because of his high standing</i>
<i>in the medical profession.</i>
<i>Dr. X, from the point of view</i>
<i>of a man of science,</i>
<i>what can be done for Lois?</i>
<i>This sort of affliction</i>
<i>is difficult to treat.</i>
<i>Let's look at the other sex</i>
<i>as Lois sees them.</i>
Oh, let's not.
<i>Can Lois ever be cured?</i>
<i>Or is she doomed to a life</i>
<i>of ever-increasing frustration?</i>
I don't know about Lois,
but I'm cured.
Haven't we seen enough?
<i>During the next hour,</i>
<i>we will try to show you...</i>
No, I don't think so.
Projectionist, will you stop
the film, please?
Please.
Thank you.
- Does anyone object?
- No.
Are you stopping the film because
there's a woman in the room?
- That's not why I'm uncomfortable.
- You think I'm offended?
Of course I'm offended, but that's
no reason to stop the film, is it?
C.J., just a moment, please.
Madame Justice Loomis, as a man,
I am somewhat embarrassed
that you have to sit here
and watch this thing.
I certainly can understand
how Harold feels.
I wouldn't want to sit through it
with my wife
or arrange a special showing
for Mother's Day.
But your wife and mother
haven't been appointed to this court.
Time is the point,
gentlemen and Madame Justice,
and we have a responsibility
not to waste it.
I have seen enough
to make my decision.
- Me too.
- Hear, hear.
- I do apologize, Justice Loomis.
- Why?
Something is very wrong here.
You're all so polite to me.
- I'm not being too outspoken, am I?
- No.
No, we want you to speak up.
Speak right out.
Raise hell if you want to.
You may be sorry you said that.
Actually, I do have one question.
How can Mr. Justice Snow
pass judgment on something
without even seeing it? Hasn't he
disqualified himself on Maloney?
Would you like to suggest that
to Justice Snow?
I don't think that's one of my privileges.
Isn't it yours?
- Well, yes, I suppose it is.
- And Mr. Chief Justice,
I'd like to examine the rest
of the film,
just to see if there's a shred
of redeeming social or artistic value.
Projectionist, would you
continue the film, please?
Thank you.
5:30 will be fine.
Howdy, Ben.
Good afternoon, Mr. Justice.
- How are you feeling?
- Just fine, thank you. Just fine.
How's Ester?
- Better and better.
- Good.
- The usual, Mr. Justice?
- Sure.
- Dan.
- Hi, Waldo.
I want you to know I'm not gonna
support madame's motion.
- What kind of motion is she making?
- Oh, I thought you knew.
Knew what?
You better get it from the C.J.
- We'll do this later, Ben.
- Yes, sir.
Hi, Dan. Missed you at lunch.
- What's she up to?
- What's who up to?
How many "she's"
do we have on the court?
Oh, that. Well, it's just that
a question came up.
Yeah.
Or more accurately,
a suggestion was made.
- Yeah?
- Well, what it amounts to is,
should...?
Should attendance be obligatory
at these obscenity screenings?
Who wasn't there besides me?
- House was packed.
- What's her beef?
Well, the lady wonders
whether a justice who hasn't seen
any part of the film hasn't, in effect...
She wants me to disqualify myself
because I won't go down there
and sit through that pile of crap.
- Well...
- So it's crap. What if it is crap?
That's not the point.
Crap's got the right to be crap.
Drop the legal language, Dan.
Are you, as chief justice,
suggesting that I disqualify myself
from voting on Maloney?
No, I'm merely suggesting
that it's been suggested.
Where are you going?
I've got a present
for Madame Just-ess.
Not roses.
And have a look
at <i>U.S. V. Albertson</i>, 1954.
It's in Volume 348, U.S.
Maybe 349.
- Is she in?
- Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Justice Snow.
Just hold on a second.
- Yes?
- <i>Madame Justice,</i>
<i>Mr. Justice Snow</i>
<i>would like to see you.</i>
He would? When?
He's here.
Just check those references.
I'll get back to you. Thank you.
Tell Mr. Justice Snow I'll be happy
to see him in a minute.
She'll be happy to see you
in a moment.
Thank you.
Ask Mr. Justice Snow
to come in, Mr. Robinson.
- You may go in, Mr. Justice.
- Thank you.
No, no. Please. Please don't get up.
Don't get up.
You'd stand, Mr. Justice,
if I came to call on you in chambers.
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that.
I can't tell you how grateful I am to you
for seeing me like this
on no notice whatsoever.
- It's my honor.
- Is it?
Well, I suppose it is.
Say,
that's quite a desk,
and so neat.
Do aircraft land here frequently?
What is it that you wanted
to see me about?
Nothing earthshaking.
By George, I was a little startled to see
that you got a male law clerk out there.
Mr. Robinson. He's not my law clerk.
He's my secretary.
Well, well, well, well.
What a generous gesture.
Letting men into a field
previously dominated by the other sex.
I'm glad you're in favor of men's lib.
Say, let's relax.
Do you feel like relaxing?
Madame Just-ess, I hope you aren't
finding our national capital too dull,
after the grandeur of Disneyland.
You don't think much of California,
do you?
Oh, I try not to think of it at all.
Why don't you try climbing
some of our mountains.
Oh, I have, I have.
I admire your mountains.
It's your valleys
that make me nervous.
Now, Madame Just-ess, I would like
your opinion on a point of law
concerning that great American
art form, the motion picture.
Help yourself.
Oh, thank you.
Now, I was wondering if, by any
chance, you'd seen a film called...
<i>The Naked Nymphomaniac</i>?
That's the one.
Now, you probably didn't even notice
I wasn't there.
- I noticed.
- Oh, you did?
Well.
Well,
I wonder if you found anything
unpleasant in the picture.
First of all, I see no reason
to overturn the lower court.
Anyone who'd seen that film
would realize that
<i>The Naked Nymphomaniac</i>
is a total offense
against the public sensibility.
It's sickening, degrading, disgusting...
My, my, my, my, my, my.
As bad as all that?
I wonder if you can put your finger
on exactly what it was
that offended you?
Was it the title?
Some particular word
in the title? "Naked", is that it?
What if they called it
<i>The Fully Clothed Nymphomaniac</i>?
Or maybe it was the other word
that bothered you?
"Nymphomaniac".
Supposing they called it
<i>The Naked Methodist</i>?
Or <i>The Naked Daughter</i>
<i>of the American Revolution</i>?
Are you finished?
Madame Just-ess, I am a long way
from being finished,
but I'll pause briefly, in case
there's something you'd like to say.
Thank you.
Let me ask you something.
Would you call a female governor
a governess?
Is a woman composer
a composeress? No.
And her sex
is entirely beside the point.
And a justice of the Supreme Court
is a justice, not Madame Just-ess.
Now, Mr. Justice, I submit that we
are failing in our duty on this court
if we don't try to stop the avalanche
of prurient slop...
- Madame, if you'll...
- I'm not finished!
Which is about to bury us.
Are we doing our job
if we permit anything?
What are we permitting?
Violence in the streets,
kids on drugs, filth, pornography...
Who slaps the labels on? You? Me?
- Somebody better.
- No, thank you.
I think it's unconstitutional
to set myself up as a censor.
Refusing to look at something
is censorship.
I don't look at television.
That doesn't make it illegal.
That's not the point.
Seeing that film is material
to making a judgment.
If you'd spent ten minutes
in that screening room, five minutes,
you would see how obscene,
how outrageous...
Censorship is an outrage!
What about a training film
for terrorists?
A free lecture, <i>How to Make</i>
<i>a Nuclear Bomb in Your Basement</i>.
Do you condone inciting
to violence?
- No, ma'am.
- What about inciting to decadence?
- Define "decay".
- That's what we're here for.
- Not me.
- We'd better try.
The people of this country have only
one absolute protection against chaos:
The law.
You and I were appointed
to this court for only one reason:
To uphold and sustain that law.
Watch out, you can't turn the law
into a straitjacket.
The law's gotta be a suit of clothes
a man can wear.
It's gotta fit easy.
Be comfortable.
Law shouldn't strap a man in
at the throat or the brain or the crotch.
That's vivid.
You're making Maloney
more important than the law.
- He is more important.
- This court doesn't try men.
We put their trials on trial.
That's it. We're constantly examining
the witness who isn't there.
All we ever get to see are lawyers,
cold records, cold briefs.
Where's the human being? Where's
the pain? We've gotta touch flesh.
I'll tell you where the pain is.
It's in the people who get hurt.
The innocent kid
who sits in a dark theater
while Maloney's filth pours over him.
That's where the pain is.
You're on the right track.
You're beginning to look at people.
When you let a little more humanity
into your thinking,
you might make
a damn good justice.
But I won't bet on it.
You're just being sweet to me
because I'm a woman.
Do I have any appointments
this afternoon?
- 3:15, Miller of security...
- Cancel it!
- Mrs. Snow just called.
- Call her back.
Tell her I can't talk to her.
And blow your nose, please.
I don't wanna talk to anybody.
I gotta work, concentrate.
Yes, sir.
He says he doesn't want...
I wouldn't dream
of disturbing Justice Snow.
I'm looking for Herbert G. Maloney,
film producer.
- There you are, Mr. Maloney.
- What?
A respected colleague of mine,
Mr. Justice Snow,
feels that this court is doing you
a great injustice
by not meeting you face to face.
We ought to hear your voice,
bask in your personality.
What was the expression he used?
Oh, yes. We should "touch flesh".
Mason, call the guard.
Don't go, Mason. This might be
quite educational for all of us.
Would you care to take
the witness stand, Mr. Maloney?
- You gonna swear me in?
- You gonna lie to me?
Maybe you better swear me in.
I, Herbert G. Maloney,
do solemnly swear
the testimony I'm about to give
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,
so help me, Loomis.
Let's get right to the point,
Mr. Maloney.
Are you aware that you broke a law?
No, ma'am.
You didn't realize that Nebraska
has statutes prohibiting pornography?
Doesn't the First Amendment
apply to guys like me?
Isn't it an umbrella that's supposed
to keep all of us from getting wet?
Or is there a hole in it
over Nebraska?
But the people of Nebraska have
the freedom to protect themselves
against your abuse of their freedom.
That's what this case is all about.
Look, lady, I'm a businessman.
I don't see where
the government's got any business
telling me how to run my business!
I'm relieved.
For a while, I thought you might be
thinking of yourself as an artist.
I do recall the word "art"
plastered across your film.
Tell me, Mr. Maloney,
do you honestly believe
<i>The Naked Nymphomaniac</i> is art?
Sure. Why not? Who's to say it isn't?
What's art anyway?
Artists don't even know,
let alone lawyers.
Exactly what was your motivation in
filming <i>The Naked Nymphomaniac</i>?
Money. You can't have much pursuit
of happiness in this country
unless you pursue a little money.
Anything unconstitutional about that?
Does the Constitution give you
the right to do anything for money?
Does it give you the right
to shove me into bankruptcy?
The lawmakers of Nebraska
want to stop the pollution of the minds
and morals of the public
by films like yours.
My colleague on this bench,
Mr. Justice Snow...
Fine man. Know him very well.
He feels strongly about profit-pursuing
conglomerates which pollute the air.
Air's different. You gotta breathe.
You don't have to go to the movies.
State and local governments have
a right to set community standards.
People can say, "I don't want this
in my neighborhood."
Is it OK for people to say, "We don't
want Baptists in our neighborhoods"?
Your film, it's called
an exploitation film, is that correct?
Right. You're keeping me
from exploiting it.
Aren't you exploiting women?
The act of love?
Giving a distorted picture of sex
to young people?
- Who am I hurting?
- I'm not talking about bodily harm.
Has anyone died from seeing
<i>The Naked Nymphomaniac</i>?
What about injury to the spirit?
Doesn't your celluloid poison
attack all human dignity
- and decency and beauty?
- I don't think you like my picture.
I think somebody had better set
some standards. Some...
...voice had better say,
"This far, and no farther."
You're talking like a woman,
not a justice.
You're talking like a justice,
not a witness. Sit down, Maloney.
Have you been to New York lately?
Times Square, 44th, 45th Street?
It used to be a decent place to visit.
Unforgettable music, powerful plays...
Today, right around the corner,
on Eighth Avenue,
your picture is probably playing
alongside a lot of other pornography
and filth.
Watch out, lady. Scratch me,
put me out of business,
and who else gets scratched?
The same end of the eraser
can wipe out your unforgettable music
and your powerful plays.
You're sharp, Maloney.
You pull every sleeve inside out.
You want the liberty
to dirty up my liberty,
my security against the profiteering,
two-legged cockroaches of this world,
my right to live in a sweet and decent
society, and not some kind of sewer.
Even in New York,
you have to clean up
after your dog shits on the sidewalk.
It's a perversion of the Constitution
to shove our faces into excrement
masquerading as art.
Oh, I'm glad I met you, Mr. Maloney.
I feel I have a much better
understanding of you
and Justice Snow.
He may want the absolute freedom
to go straight to hell. That's his right,
but he has no right to force the rest
of the country to take the trip with him.
You may step down.
Yeah, you make
a pretty good trial lawyer.
- Too bad you had to give it up.
- You make a very good actor.
I may always feel there's
a pornographic producer
under your robes.
It makes me sick to my stomach
to have to defend a principle
as noble as the First Amendment
on the basis of that can of film
you found so offensive.
But, by God, as long as I have tongue
and tonsils and the ability to talk,
I'll defend everybody's right to speak
and every man's right to be wrong.
I yield to you as the authority on that,
Mr. Justice.
She's dangerous.
That woman is positively dangerous.
The men on this court
have got to stick together.
After all, there are only eight of us left
against all of her.
- Should we smile a little?
- Good God, no.
Who'd trust a happy justice?
Should the lady be standing
while the five of us are sitting?
This is where the newest member
of the court is supposed to be.
Ready, everybody? Please
don't look directly into the camera.
And I think if you seem
to be looking out into space...
- Into the future?
- I can't see that far.
- I didn't bring my glasses.
- You'll need more than glasses.
My wife always hates these pictures.
She says we look stuffed.
Why don't we take a snapshot
of our convictions.
It'd have to be a moving picture,
if convictions mean anything.
- My convictions don't move.
- Neither did the dinosaurs.
Here we go.
Oh, no, no. Come on.
Tear that one up.
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
Would somebody suggest
to our great dissenter
that he curb his celebrated
sense of humor?
He'll need all his wits to keep on
writing minority opinions.
A man's gotta decide whether to be
on the right side or the winning side.
Once in a while, they're the same.
This court won't reverse
the 7th Circuit on Omnitech.
We sure won't
if we don't even hear it!
Now, come on.
Hold that for the conference room.
You can wreck the whole business
establishment, Mr. Justice Snow,
with your damned socialist ideas...
I'm about as much of a socialist
as Donald Duck,
and you know it,
you brainwashed Brahman!
Now, come on, come on, come on.
Harold, come on. Sit down there.
Come on, now.
Dan, behave yourself.
Here we go.
- Destroy that negative.
- Yes, sir.
Now, Harold, try to remember
what you did with your face last year.
- You looked pretty good.
- I did?
Just look trustworthy.
Somebody in Washington
had better look that way.
Is Justice Snow implying that nobody
in this city or this country is honest
except him?
- To hell with the picture.
- Where are you going?
- We've got to finish this.
- Paste me in from last year.
All right, Richard.
We'll try again tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
- It's been a pleasure.
- Good afternoon, sir.
Where are you going?
Not to Europe again.
Much farther than that.
Virginia.
Yes, you can take those too.
I'll bring this myself.
I thought I'd be gone
before you came home.
Usually, that's not very difficult.
I left a note for you
on the dining room table.
I don't want to read any notes.
Then talk it over
with my lawyers.
They thought that would avoid
any unnecessary unpleasantness.
What's so pleasant
about talking to lawyers?
Maybe the court can stand
your bad temper, but I can't!
What do you mean, "bad temper"?
Goddamn it!
I'm the sweetest-tempered son of
a bitch in the District of Columbia!
- Sit down!
- Why should I sit down?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Describe the wallpaper.
- What wallpaper?
- In this room.
- The wallpaper?
- What color is it?
- What design?
- Who memorizes wallpaper?
You can't memorize
what you don't ever see.
Goodbye, Dan.
Pink roses and butterflies,
for chrissake.
How does the great dissenter feel
about our playing tennis together?
I'm not sure. I haven't told him yet.
I must say, Dan Snow has done
a lot for my game.
Every time I get a high one
I can really kill,
that's not you on the other side
of the net.
That's why they go by me so fast.
Go change. I'll give you a lift
to Mount Olympus.
How do you stand his moods,
Mason?
Every time I see him,
he's ready to explode.
Does he ever just relax?
Yeah, he does have strong feelings.
Same as you do.
I hope you're not implying
that we're alike.
No, no, no. I just mean
that you have similar differences.
You both care about things.
Nothing's unimportant,
whether you're making a point
on the bench or on the tennis court.
Does Justice Snow
ever talk about me?
Oh, all the time.
Anything quotable?
Well...
I withdraw the question.
Hearsay evidence. Inadmissible.
Morning.
You're not a double agent,
are you, Mason?
No, sir. We just get in a set
of tennis about once a week.
Before breakfast.
She plays very well for a justice
of the Supreme Court.
- She's got a hell of a backhand, sir.
- Yeah, I know. I've seen it work.
Well, when we found out
we were both tennis players...
- Well, I hope you don't mind, sir.
- Hell, no!
Go ahead. Wear her out.
Yes, sir.
Why are you trying to persuade me?
You know I won't vote to hear it.
All right, all right, all right, all right!
We'll table this one.
- Why not table everything?
- Oh, no. <i>Abbott v. Omnitech</i>.
Oh, come on.
I think putting Omnitech on
the calendar is an exercise in futility.
- Right.
- Oh, is it?
Perhaps if we stop recruiting judges
from the jungles of Orange County,
maybe we can get a 4-5 court
turned into a 5-4 court.
I'm so sick and tired of being on
the short end of the vote all the time.
- We're saving you from that.
- I don't wanna be saved!
I want to keep right on going
straight to hell.
What's Omnitech done?
That's what these little stockholders
are trying to find out.
But, Dan, the momentum engine
doesn't work.
That's what Omnitech says. What
about experts who say otherwise?
But we'll never know, will we?
Because Donald Richards,
chairman of Omnitech,
has bought up all the patents
and buried them.
This action is against Omnitech,
not Donald Richards.
Donald Richards is Omnitech,
for chrissake!
And where the hell is he?
And why has he disappeared?
Lmmaterial.
I don't see any new constitutional
grounds for us to review Omnitech.
If we don't hear it, who in the hell will?
This is the last goddamned stop, lady!
Why does Brother Snow insist on
wasting the court's valuable time?
Because I smell
plenty of unrefrigerated fish here.
Muckraking. That's all it is, Dan.
Do you like being screwed? Because
that's what Donald Richards is doing.
He's screwing you and me
and the whole country.
- You're a troublemaker.
- Yes, I know that,
but somebody has to be, C.J.
Move up Omnitech!
- Good morning, Mr. Justice Snow.
- Morning.
What makes you think
it's gonna rain?
The newspaper said there's
an 80 percent chance of rain or snow.
What do they know?
They're wrong 80 percent of the time.
- That was our floor.
- Yes. Why didn't you get out?
I thought you go first.
How would you like to take
a little trip with me?
That's what we seem to be doing.
- Ever been to the Smithsonian?
- Not lately.
Understand, I wouldn't dream of
changing your mind for the world,
but there's something at the
Smithsonian you ought to look at.
Some early American pornography?
- Good morning, Mr. Justice.
- Good morning.
What have you got in the briefcase,
Harold? Dirty books?
What I want you to see
at the Smithsonian
isn't even vaguely offensive
to the public sensibility.
What time?
- Three o'clock.
- Make it 3:15.
We'll take my car.
What time does
the Smithsonian close?
This won't take long.
Why don't we take my car.
It has a top.
Well, I guess the paper
was right about the rain.
First time they've been right
in 20 years.
Lady, what you are about to see
is a revolution.
Nonviolent, I hope.
This is it.
Spin it. Go ahead, go ahead.
Give it a spin. It won't hurt you.
That is a momentum engine.
Oh, it's a model, of course,
prototype.
Imagine a flywheel 20 times heavier,
revolving 1,000 times faster,
in a sealed vacuum.
This could revolutionize
the entire auto industry.
We could have cars without gas tanks.
They wouldn't need gas to run.
This is what Omnitech
bought and buried.
If you want to change my vote
on Omnitech, no, thank you.
I'm trying to change dead words
on a page into a visual image
to clarify in your mind...
Don't treat me
like a first-year law student.
- I'm just trying...
- To change my mind.
I'm trying to help you
change your mind all by yourself.
That machine is a dandy idea,
and it just doesn't work.
It's never been given a chance to work.
It's been squashed.
Would you go to all this trouble
if I were a man?
- One of the brothers?
- Sex has nothing to do with it.
Because I'm a woman, your male ego
wants to win me over.
Thomas Jefferson said,
"An educated electorate is the basis..."
You're an arrogant,
self-centered, male chauvinist pig!
You're just being sweet to me
because I'm a man.
I only wanted you to see
with your own eyes
that gasoline isn't the
only way to store energy.
Well, don't expect me to believe that
that <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>
whirligig could run a car.
Having trouble, are you?
Excuse me.
Finally got the auto club.
It may be a while.
We could take a cab
if we could get a cab.
- Have you eaten anything?
- No, I just got in here, same as you.
I meant today.
Oh, today, well, I'm not sure.
I don't keep track.
- Know what that does to blood sugar?
- What do you care?
A person can't make
valid judgments.
- Is that anyplace in the Constitution?
- Good evening.
Good evening. I'm not hungry.
Just a cup of coffee, please. Black.
You are hungry and don't know it.
I'm not hungry, and I know it.
I'll order something for you.
<i>Nei gong matyeh wa ah</i>?
You're not telling her to put poison
in my food, are you?
I don't know how to say "poison".
<i>Paiquat.</i>
- <i>Paiquat.</i>
- <i>Ching ching hai.</i>
- <i>Ching ching hai.</i>
- <i>Jingyu.</i>
- <i>Jingyu.</i>
- <i>Gad dimsum.</i>
<i>Dimsum.</i>
I appreciate your concern
about my insides.
Do me a favor, will you?
Put your hand over your eyes.
- Why?
- A test.
- What's on the wall?
- Wallpaper.
- What color?
- Gold.
- Any pattern?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- Cherry blossoms with bluebirds.
- How the hell did you know that?
- I saw it when we came in.
You go around looking at wallpaper
everyplace? My God!
That's what's wrong with you!
Your brains are full of wallpaper.
- Well, your brain is full of...
- Watch that, watch...
People, people here.
I was going to say momentum
engines and Omnitech.
Omnitech may be the most
important case of this decade.
When one group of stockholders tries
to undermine a great corporation...
Big, huge, not necessarily great.
How come the president of Omnitech
didn't show up at his trial?
He doesn't want the courts
to put him out of business.
Rule against them,
and down goes the corporate system.
- Only the abuses.
- In your isolated opinion.
Not so isolated. The first judge
ruled for the stockholders.
- If we try to extend our jurisdiction
- What's fair?
Into legislative area...
Don't you see, Omnitech must win?
- You think that, do you?
- Yes!
It seems, to me, anything can
happen no matter how great the odds.
That's what makes this country
so wonderful.
I absolutely agree with you.
But you know what I believe above
all else? You said it on the bench!
You said, "The noblest purpose
of this high court
"is to keep the government
off the backs of the people."
- People, yes!
- Aren't corporations people?
- Owned by people, run by people?
- Not the large...
- For the benefit of people?
- Not the large...
They may be destroyed by people
on the high court who have forgotten
some of their earlier
and wiser opinions.
To hell with this.
You haven't eaten your dim sum.
- To hell with my dim sum.
- And your blood sugar?
The hell with my blood sugar. All
I wanted is a cup of coffee and a fork.
- Is something wrong?
- Yes! Everything! Give me a check.
- I'll take the check.
- Yes, you do that.
You'll feel better about it. Don't worry
about me. I'll be fine. I'll take a cab.
Good.
It's nothing personal.
He's just very upset.
He's been working too hard.
I don't have any money for a cab.
Good night, Madame Justice.
Would you deliver these
to Justice Snow in the morning?
Justice Snow is still here.
- I don't think so.
- He's in the court, ma'am.
- This late?
- Yes, ma'am.
OK, thank you.
How long have you been here?
Since October.
I'm not sure the lady has enough
seniority to haunt these chambers at...
...1:20 in the morning.
What the hell
are you doing here so late?
Studying for finals.
What about you?
Well, I used to think I lived
in Georgetown,
but I guess this is more
my permanent residence.
I brought you these.
A few opinions of mine
from the lower court.
- I'll read them, thank you.
- You're welcome.
May I ask you a question?
Sure.
Other than my blood sugar
and my bad table manners,
exactly how repulsive
do you think I am?
Do you want my opinion
as a justice of the Supreme Court?
No, no, no, no, no. As a woman.
- Do you want to take the Fifth?
- Maybe one of us had better.
My car runs now.
Would you like a lift home?
No, it's pretty cool around
the Snow household these days.
I heard that. I'm sorry.
It's your fault, you know.
My fault?
My wife thinks that I spend
so much time being furious at you
that I don't have enough energy left
to be furious with her.
And I have a hunch...
...she thinks I consider you
attractive.
There's certainly no evidence
to support that contention.
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that.
I hope you assure Mrs. Snow
that the mere fact
that one of your colleagues
is a woman...
That's no mere fact.
It's an overwhelming fact.
But I've never been prejudiced by sex.
Entertained, yes. Prejudiced, never.
Yes, yes, yes, this is a dandy.
I remember it well.
I don't agree with a word of it,
but it's well-written.
How can you be so goddamn logical
and so goddamn wrong?
What's so wrong
about encouraging the economy?
I've heard you talk over and over
again about
improving the quality of life on this
planet, and I agree with you, Dan.
- Justice Snow.
- "Dan" is fine.
Look what these great companies
have done...
Large companies. Large.
Are we throwing
those benefits away?
Should I take my weekly wash to the
Potomac River and beat it with rocks?
You won't get it very clean.
If we reverse the 7th Circuit
on Omnitech...
If it is so damn important,
why doesn't Donald Richards
stand trial?
- What do you want to know?
- You're not Donald Richards.
He's the one with the answers.
Swear me in.
Oh, you want to play
that game again.
All right, you're sworn.
I am delighted, Mr. Donald Richards,
to have you here at last,
in the flesh, so to speak.
Would you state your occupation,
please?
I'm president and chairman
of the board of Omnitech International.
Why did you refuse to testify in
the suit against your company?
I never received a subpoena.
They have to know
where you are to serve it,
but you deliberately made yourself
unavailable, remained in hiding.
Doesn't an American citizen
have a right to privacy?
Tell me something, sir, I'll bet you have
a share or two of stock in Omnitech.
I'm the majority stockholder.
Yes, I kind of thought you were.
Now, what about all those
little stockholders
who got wind of the appalling notion
that you, Mr. Richards, grabbed up
an earthshaking idea and strangled it?
You know what I find appalling?
That you have the arrogance
to pass judgment
on something
you don't know anything about.
But you do, Mr. Richards?
When we test something,
like the momentum engine,
and we find out it doesn't work,
we drop it.
We spend our time and money
on something that will work.
What about the experts
who say it does work?
You think that I would deliberately
dump an idea
that could make millions
for my stockholders?
But you've got billions committed
to the internal combustion engine.
Omnitech makes spark plugs,
you want to go on making spark plugs.
There's money in carburetors,
you want to go on making carburetors.
You've got vested interests
in 16 oil companies,
you want to go on selling gas.
You have one noble purpose,
Mr. Richards:
To keep things the way they are.
Look, an idea
doesn't just turn into a reality.
Something's got to make it happen.
It takes money to build factories,
grind out a product, advertise it, sell it.
Did you ever hear of a box of cereal
or a tube of toothpaste
going out and giving birth to itself?
Do you know what it takes?
- Capital.
- Capital! You're damn right!
And I'm not going to commit
my corporation to the expenditure
of millions of dollars
on an idea that just doesn't work.
That you say doesn't work.
Look! Thomas Edison
dreamed up the electric light bulb.
The government gave him a patent so
that he could profit from his invention.
Fine! But the light itself
belongs to everybody.
And nobody, nobody has a right
to turn on the darkness.
You dare accuse me, my company,
my companies of practices
that belong in the Dark Ages. I...
Then let there be light! Come out
of the dark, Donald Richards!
Who are you? What do you look like?
Where have you been?
Holy Christ, you know what I think?
I think you're dead, Donald Richards.
I think you've been dead for a long
time. Eight, maybe ten years.
It's been that long since anyone
has seen you.
And if you are dead,
who is running Omnitech?
Who actually holds all that power?
Some cabal of faceless men
without names, without fingerprints,
without Social Security numbers, who
are compounding your suppression
of the momentum engine
by hiding behind a dead man?
- Why would anybody wanna do that?
- Hell of a lot of reasons.
Dodge inheritance taxes,
avoid a power struggle,
hang on to government contracts.
Omnitech is a phantom government
hiding behind a dead man.
We can't see it. We didn't elect it.
It doesn't exist. It never dies!
Why don't we hoist up a new flag.
The Star-Spangled Omnitech!
Omnitech rules the waves!
Omnitech <i>ber alles</i>!
Dan, are you all right?
Yeah, sure.
It was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it.
One, two.
Up.
- What do the doctors say?
- They don't know. They're testing.
- Is he in any pain?
- No. I don't think so.
I don't ever remember
Dan being sick before.
He considers it unconstitutional.
I've never walked into that chamber
without Dan there.
Are you ready,
gentlemen and Madame Justice?
After today's session, I need 24 hours.
I have to go to California.
Something I have to be
absolutely sure about.
Of course.
<i>We are making our descent to</i>
<i>John Wayne/Orange County Airport.</i>
<i>Please be sure your seat belt</i>
<i>is securely fastened.</i>
<i>Golden West Airlines announces</i>
<i>flight 710 from Los Angeles,</i>
<i>now arriving at gate B.</i>
Welcome home, Madame Justice.
You look fabulous.
- Thanks, Bill. Thanks for meeting me.
- Thank you for letting me.
How about your luggage?
- This is it.
- That's it?
I have to catch
the redeye back tonight.
You're kidding?
I had a lot of things arranged for us.
I'm a working girl.
Not even one set? I was planning
on beating you this time.
The court sits tomorrow morning.
Well, you were right.
Loomis and Loomis
did have dealings with Omnitech.
But I don't think it's anything
you should be worried about.
I'd say your husband's relationship with
Donald Richards lasted five minutes.
- Is this all there is?
- That's it.
Now, I've made reservations for lunch
at a new place on the water.
But first, let's stop by the office.
Lots of people there'd like to see what
a Supreme Court justice looks like.
What's the matter?
I never could read
your husband's shorthand.
I can.
- Take me to Bekins Warehouse.
- What for?
Just take me.
Loomis records
are on the left-hand side, at the end.
Why is this one locked?
Big surprise to me.
I never thought of the Supreme Court
as an investigative body.
What's in there?
- You don't wanna know.
- Give me the key.
And don't tell me you haven't got it.
You knew about this all along,
didn't you?
So did your husband.
Reverend Loomis preached
the sermon. I just said, "Amen."
I don't believe this.
- I just don't believe this.
- Good. It's better that way.
Put the file away.
Turn the key, and it never happened.
If you think I'm gonna shove this back
into the dark to protect you or the firm
or myself, you're dead wrong.
Get me the references
on <i>Dalton v. Utah</i>.
I want a fax of the Black letter
that's on my desk,
on the top of <i>Sperry v. Virginia.</i>
Right.
You shouldn't be out of bed,
Mr. Justice.
Nurse, can you lend me a quarter?
Just a minute, operator.
Reverse the charges, will you?
Yes. Just reverse... Make it a...
Mason, tell the operator
you'll pay for the call, will you?
Justice Snow
is at the telephone again.
I'm aware of that, Mason.
I am aware of that.
Just because I'm in a hospital
doesn't mean my mind
isn't functioning.
Listen, don't let them take that
Omnitech vote without me. It's...
<i>Dr. Halloran, please call</i>
<i>extension 429. Red blanket...</i>
<i>Will the head surgical nurse</i>
<i>call the main desk, please?</i>
<i>Dr. Sing, please go</i>
<i>to the Orthopedic Wing.</i>
<i>Dr. Sing, go to the Orthopedic Wing.</i>
You have just dropped
American justice on the floor.
<i>Dr. Foley, please go to Admitting.</i>
Hi.
Come on in.
- How are you?
- How are you?
I'm fine. Pay no attention to the
buzzards circling above the building.
They yanked out my telephone.
How do they expect you to get any
work done here? What are you doing?
I'm not gonna fall out.
They can kill you in the hospital
if you don't stick up for your rights.
You be a good boy, now, Mr. Justice,
and don't give us any more trouble.
Get me another pillow.
Maybe I should talk to you
another time.
Oh, no. No. What's the problem?
Come here.
I just wanted to tell you this before
you heard it from somebody else.
- I went to California for the day...
- Couldn't take it?
I'm resigning from the court.
Why would you do
a damn fool thing like that?
I found out that, Jack, my husband,
and our law firm
were involved with Omnitech.
Good morning, Dan. Morning.
Dr. Parker.
Madame Justice Loomis.
- How do you do?
- It's a pleasure.
Somebody swiped my telephone,
doctor.
No. We took it out, Dan.
We want you to rest.
How do you expect me to rest
without a telephone?
That logic will get you nowhere.
And would you please stop
trying to change the hospital rules?
The First Amendment to the
Constitution doesn't apply in hospitals.
It should.
What the hell are you doing here?
Official business
of the federal government.
May I come in?
Oh, did I get you in the middle
of something? I'm sorry.
What did you do?
Just get up and walk out?
- Yes, ma'am. This is very nice.
- You're still under observation.
- It's bigger than my place.
- They don't know what happened.
They'll have to figure it out.
I can't give them more of my time.
- Dan, if it was a coronary...
- Coronary?!
My heart wouldn't dare attack me.
Now what's all this crap
about quitting?
Do you mind?
- Why don't you lie down.
- That's OK.
- Put your feet up.
- I'll be all right. I don't wanna get...
- Can I get you a pillow?
- Sure. Why not?
- Are you asleep?
- Yes.
Here.
You wanna tell me what's wrong?
Are you well enough to talk?
I'm even well enough to listen.
The other night,
you made an outrageous statement.
You said you didn't think
Donald Richards was still alive.
I got this out of a sealed
Loomis and Loomis file in Santa Ana.
It's Donald Richards'
death certificate.
Holy God.
- Anybody else see this?
- No.
This makes Omnitech
a whole new ball game.
My God, are we gonna shake up
the brothers.
Get your clothes on. We can still make
that morning conference.
- I'm not going.
- What?
I told you,
I'm resigning from the court.
Well, that's idiotic.
It doesn't make any sense.
My husband knew. Jack knew that
Donald Richards died in Costa Rica
in 1973, and he was part
of the conspiracy to cover it up.
Did you know? Did your husband
ever tell you anything about it?
No. Of course not.
Then there's no reason to resign. Get
some clothes on, let's get down there.
If there is the slightest doubt in
anybody's mind that I belong there,
I don't wanna be there.
Lady, that is extremely noble
but goddamn wrong.
What do you think I should do?
What's protocol? Write the president?
You write nobody. Keep your robes on,
let the mud fly. It won't stick.
Quitting the court
without good reason
is spitting in the face of the
government that put you there.
I've got good reason.
Because of what your husband
did that you didn't know about?
When you're married,
you're a part of them.
You're a member of the high court.
When they give you that chair
that you'll sit in for life,
something happens!
"In a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye,
"this corruption shall put on
incorruption."
<i>St. Paul v. The Corinthians.</i>
Et al. Interesting case.
But what if an incorrupt person
finds out that she's corrupt?
That's applesauce, and you know it.
I thought you'd be happy
to have me off the court.
Oh, that was before
you were on the court.
I never thought I'd ever kiss
a Supreme Court justice.
You didn't kiss me. I kissed you.
Make you a deal.
You don't resign, I don't die.
Let me think about that.
Don't we want
the working entrance?
Not this morning.
Right up the front steps.
I can't wait to get into that
conference room.
You really think we can go in there
and I can pick up where I left off?
Hell, no! Every day is different.
You're different, I'm different.
Every morning, fresh beginning,
fresh start.
- First Monday in October.
- Always.
Hey! What about the meter?
- Oh, I don't have any money.
- You liberals never do.
- $4.25.
- Here.
- Keep the change
- Thanks, Your Honor.
You know what's on the calendar
right after Omnitech, don't you?
<i>The First Atheist Church</i>
<i>v. The City of Waco, Texas.</i>
- Ain't gonna miss that one, are you?
- Community standards should prevail.
And religious freedom?
- Atheism is a religion?
- God, yes.
Oh, Dan! What about
<i>Cook County Diocese v. John Doe</i>?
- What about <i>Smith v. U.S.</i>?
- <i>Miller v. Moon</i>?
- <i>Dalton v. Utah</i>?
- We'll have a battle on that one.
- Count on it.
- You shouldn't climb these steps.
Why not? This is my mountain.
Our mountain.
You know something?
You and I make each other possible.
Damn right, we do.
