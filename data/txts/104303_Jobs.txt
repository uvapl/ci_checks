<i>INTERVIEWER: And with that movie
</i> 2001, <i>you're projecting us</i>
<i>into the 21st century.</i>
<i>I brought along
my son, Jonathan,</i>
<i>who, in the year 2001, will
be the same age as I am now.</i>
<i>Maybe he will be better
adjusted to this kind of world</i>
<i>that you're trying
to portray.</i>
ARTHUR C. CLARKE: The big
difference, when he grows up...
In fact, ifwe wanted to
wait until the year 2001,
is that he will have,
in his own house,
not a computer
as big as this,
but at least a console
through which he can talk to
his friendly local computer
and get all the information he
needs for his everyday life,
like his bank statements,
his theater reservations,
all the information
you need
in the course of living
in a complex modern society.
This will be in a compact
form in his own house.
He'll have
a television screen,
like these here,
and a keyboard,
and he'll talk to the computer,
and get information from it.
And he'll take it as much for
granted as we take the telephone.
I wonder, though,
what sort of a life
would it be like,
in social terms?
If our whole life is built
around the computer,
do we become
a computer-dependent society?
In some ways, but they will
also enrich our society
because it will
make it possible for us
to live, really,
anywhere we like.
Any businessman and executive could
live almost anywhere on Earth
and still do his business
through a device like this.
And this is a wonderful thing, it means
we won't have to be stuck in cities.
We'll be able to live out in the
country, or wherever we please.
<i>HERTZFELD: Screen says
it's an unimplemented trap,</i>
<i>but the error code is wrong,
it's</i> a <i>system error.</i>
<i>JOAN</i> NA: <i>So what's the upshot?
HERTZFELD: It's not gonna say, "Hello."</i>
<i>STEVE: It absolutely is
gonna say "Hello. "</i>
<i>HERTZFELD: It's nobody's
fault, it's</i> a <i>system error.</i>
STEVE: You built
the voice demo.
The voice demo is flaky...
Keep your voices down.
I've been telling you that for...
This thing is overbuilt.
It worked last night.
It worked the night before that.
lt worked three hours ago.
It's not working now, so just
skip over the voice demo.
Fuck you.
Everything else is working.
Skip over the voice demo.
We need it to say, "Hello."
You're not hearing me, it's
not going to say, "Hello."
Just fix it.
Fix it?
Yeah.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
In 40 minutes?
Fix it.
I can't. Who's the
person who can?
I'm the person who can,
and I can't.
How bad are you saying?
It's pretty bad.
I don't know
what that means.
It means the demo is more
than likely gonna crash.
You have to keep
your voices down,
Joel Pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house.
I don't care if...
Who's Joel Pforzheimer?
GQ. He's been shadowing you
for a week, did you notice?
Just look like
everything's fine,
he's sitting out
in the house.
H9)'-
What are you guys saying?
Some kind of race condition, but we
haven't been able to track it down yet.
Is the synthesizer
sampling fast enough?
HERTZFELD: No, so the rates are
off, and it keeps crashing.
JOANNA: It's 20 seconds out of a
two-hour launch, why notjust cut it?
We can't cut it.
Yeah, you just cut it.
Two days ago,
we ran a Super Bowl ad
that could've won the Oscar
for Best Short Film.
There are more people
who can tell you about the ad
than can tell you
who won the game.
I understand, but the ad said the
Mac was gonna save the world.
It didn't say it was
gonna say, "Hello."
CUNNINGHAM: We open
the house in five.
Don't open the house.
We're taking a quick break.
Part of the problem is,
we can recompile... What?
...but if it's a hardware problem,
we can't get into the back.
Why not?
Do you wanna tell her,
or should I?
Don't start with me, man.
Why can't he get
into the machine?
You need special tools.
What kind of special tools?
Just take a screwdriver.
He didn't want users
to be able to open it.
You need special tools.
Is this for real?
There are 100 engineers walking around
here. None of them have the tools?
HERTZFELD: In fairness, not many
of them were issued the tools.
STEVE: What about you?
HERTZFELD: I left them at the
office, itwas 3:00 a.m. when I...
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Cut "Hello." No!
What's the first
rule of a launch?
It's not gonna crash.
Itjustdid.
Andy!
Which one?
The other Andy. You're right
there, why would I be calling out?
He needs to talk to you.
CUNNINGHAM: Yeah.
STEVE: The exit signs
need to be off,
or we're not gonna
get a full blackout.
CUNNINGHAM: We've spoken
to the building manager
and the fire marshal.
And?
There's absolutely no way they're
gonna let us turn the exit signs off.
I'll pay whatever
the fine is.
The fine is, they're gonna come
in and tell everyone to leave.
You explained to
the fire marshal
that we're in here
changing the world?
I did, but unless we can
also change
the properties of fire,
he doesn't care.
Steve...
If a fire causes a stampede
to the unmarked exits,
it'll have been well worth it
for those who survive.
For those who don't, less so,
but still pretty good.
Look,LH I need it to go black.
Real black.
Get rid of the exit signs and
don't let me know how you did it.
Fix the voice demo.
JOANNA: You need special
tools to open the Mac?
STEVE: You knew it was
a closed system.
I didn't know literally.
Jesus.
And ifyou keep alienating
people for no reason,
there's gonna be no one left
for it to say "Hello" to.
STEVE: It's not
for no reason.
We blow this, and IBM will own the
next 50 years like a Batman villain.
Remember the phone company?
That's what Bell was called,
"the phone company."
IBM will be
the computer company.
Ten years later, theyWlbe
the information company,
and that's very bad
for the human race.
So we don't have time
to be polite or realistic,
because ifwe are, this
company's next product launch
will be held
in front of 26 people
and a stringer from the Alameda
County Shoppers' Guide.
We haven't advertised
the voice software.
We could pull it
out of the demo,
and no one would
be disappointed.
Do you want to try being
reasonable, just, you know,
see what it feels like?
Okay. Pull the voice demo.
Thank you.
And then cancel the launch.
CUNNINGHAM: I see.
You just tricked me
a little.
STEVE: You can tell me
how unimportant it is,
but if the computer
doesn't say, "Hello,"
then neither
will John Sculley,
who, I promise you,
agrees with me.
Sculley's not gonna cancel the
launch because he's not insane.
He's also not a hack,
and when it comes
to the Macintosh,
he's gonna do
what I ask him to do.
What's in this box?
Nothing you need to worry
about, don't even open it.
STEVE: What the fuck?
Why is there a carton of...
Who did this?
Somebody thought...
Who?
Doesn't matter.
Thought itwould be
a good idea
to have copies
of that Time cover
available at
everyone's seat.
It was nipped in the bud,
and all the copies
are being taken
out of the building,
so, problem solved.
This isn't a Macintosh.
I understand.
Somebody thought it
would be a good idea
to, like, enthusiastically
hand over copies of Time
with a not-a-Macintosh
on the cover
at the launch
of the Macintosh?
What are they handing out
at Hewlett-Packard?
A bushel of apples
with my face on them?
I'm sure the thinking was...
Yeah?
...that since the computer
is Man of the Year
that that's good
for our business,
but like I said, I'm having
them removed from the building.
What I'd like you
to do with them
is to take them,
all 2,600 copies,
and stack them
on Kottke's desk,
and tell him Steve says,
"Happy New Year to you."
0K3)'-
I gave Time magazine full
access, the whole campus.
Bandley, Apple ll, Lisa. I
gave him Sculley, Markkula.
I gave him Woz,
I gave him everybody.
What should I call
the person who thought
it would be a good idea
to hand these out?
I'm not telling you
who it was.
It was done without malice,
it's been taken care of.
You have a half hour, and we
have things to talk about.
Like what?
(SIGHS)
Like a million
in the first 90 days.
Joanna“. 20,000 a
month after that.
Look. Those are the forecasts.
I'm begging you.
Because this is my field,
I'm begging you to manage
expectations out there.
I'm fanning expectations.
We're not gonna sell a million
in the first 90 days.
Everyone, everyone, everyone.
Everyone is waiting
for the Mac.
Maybe.
But what happens when they
find out that for $2,495,
there's nothing
you can do with it?
We were competitive
at $1,500,
but once you replaced the
Motorola 6809 with the 68000...
Which is what
supports menus, windows,
point and click,
high-res graphics...
Yeah, because everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners.
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class.
I don't have the first fucking
idea what that means,
but this is how
it got to $2,500,
which is the price point on the
PC, which can do a lot more!
STEVE: Who's gonna want a PC?
What idiot is gonna want...
If I wanna tell you
there's a spot
on your shirt,
I point to the spot.
I don't say there's a spot 14
centimeters down from the collar
and three centimeters to the
right of the second button,
while I try to remember what
the command is for club soda.
That's not how
a person's mind works.
If the goal was ease of use, maybe
you should've given it some memory.
You can complain about memory,
or you can complain about price,
but you can't do both
at the same time.
Memory is what costs money.
And I'm glad you're telling me
your feelings about the Mac now
because we have
a half hour left.
We can redesign it.
I'm just asking you
to manage expectations.
Look at their faces
when they see what it is.
They won't know what they're
looking at or why they like it,
but they'll know
they want it.
Not instantly.
<i>When people</i> heard
<i>Rite of Spring,</i>
they tore the chairs
out of the theater,
they didn't buy the record.
<i>STEVE: Rite of Spring
happens to be</i>
the most revolutionary and provocative
symphony of the last century.
<i>JOANNA: Ballet.
It was</i> a <i>ballet.</i>
But Igor Stravinsky didn't say he was
gonna sell 20,000 units a month.
I don't know why we're
talking about Stravinsky,
when what I care about
is Dan Kottke
sodomizing me
in Time magazine.
Look. Obviously...
Let me say this.
Obviously, Daniel didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.
By talking to Time
about it?
Yeah.
I don't know
what that means.
You said, when you told me the story...
You said, you said to Dan,
"Did Time magazine ask you if
I had a daughter named Lisa?"
And Dan said, "Yeah."
<i>My point was that he answered
you simply and honestly</i>
<i>because he didn't think
he'd done anything wrong.</i>
Except, Joanna, except,
I don't have
a daughter named Lisa.
And this story is now about how I'm
denying paternity and took a blood test.
And that's why
there's a picture of...
I don't know what
the fuck that is.
That's why there's a picture
of a PC on the cover
instead of a picture of me
and the Mac.
I don't know
what to tell you.
I was supposed to be Time
magazine's Man of the Year.
And then Dan Kottke
was born.
Well...
What?
She's waiting for you.
Who?
Chrisann.
Brennan?
<i>JOANNA: They're out
in the hall.</i>
<i>They've been
sitting in the back</i>
<i>of the auditorium
since 7:00 this morning.</i>
I'm not having a session
with Chrisann right now.
We issued 335 press
credentials for the launch.
Steve, you piss off Chrisann,
she's gonna stand inthelobby
and give 335 interviews,
and you, pal, will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke.
(SIGHS)
Let me
get this over with.
But don't leave.
You're gonna stay here.
What? No, I'm not.
No. There's less of
a chance of a scene
ifyou stay here,
she'll be cool.
I find all this excruciatingly
personal and...
(STAMMERS)
I'm not staying.
Come on.
I don't wanna be in a room
alone with Chrisann.
This is me and you.
Fine.
H9)'-
Steve.
This is a surprise.
Why don't you come on in?
Thank you.
You coming too?
Yes, I'm not gonna
leave her in the hallway.
Okay. It's a safe hallway,
but anyway.
You remember Joanna Hoffman? She's
the head of marketing for the Mac.
Good to see you.
Nice to see you.
Hello, Lisa.
We've met before, and you told
me you like the way I talk,
and that was my favorite thing
anyone's ever said to me.
You're from Poland.
Yes, I am. Do you
know where that is?
The top of the Earth.
Ithink you're thinking
of the North Pole.
Well, we're a little
pressed for time, so...
lﬂleave
you guys alone.
Why do you wanna leave
when you just said...
I'm gonna check in
with Hertzfeld.
We're trying to get
a computer to say "Hello,"
but right now
it's being very shy.
Would you come help me?
lsthatokay?
Sure.
STEVE: Thank you.
My dad named
a computer after me.
I'm not your...
Actually, do you know
what a coincidence is, Lisa?
No.
Like ifyou met someone.
You made a new friend
and her name was Lisa, too.
That would be
a coincidence.
"Lisa" stands for "local
integrated systems architecture."
L-I-S-A.
It's a coincidence.
You about done?
Yeah.
Okay.
JOANNA: Come.
Let's make that
computer say "Hi."
Go ahead, Lisa.
So it was
the other way around.
I was named
after the computer?
Nothing was named after anybody.
It's a coincidence.
Come on.
(VOICE BREAKING)
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you? Why
are you telling her these things?
Why are you still telling
her I'm her father?
Ajudge told her you're her father.
No, he didn't.
And where the hell
do you get off
telling Time magazine I've slept
with 28% of the men in America?
That's not...
Where do you get off?
That's not remotely
what I said.
(SNAPPING FINGERS)
It's right here.
First of all, can I tell you
something about Time magazine?
Ibefieveifs a training
facility for paid assassins.
"Jobs insists,"
lam quoting...
I didn't invent math.
"'28% of the male population of the
United States could be the father."'
I wasn't saying you've slept
with 28% of American men.
I was using an algorithm
based on the blood test,
which said there was a 94.1%
chance that I'm the father.
You're trying to publicly paint
me as a slut and a whore.
Believe me, I'm not trying to
publicly do anything with you.
Two million people read Time.
How am I supposed...
It would be more ifthey'd
put me on the cover,
but Dan Kottke decided
to kidney-punch me.
I applied for
welfare yesterday.
STEVE: I'm sorry?
Hello!
I said I applied
for welfare yesterday.
The Time article said your Apple
stock was worth $441 million.
And I wanted to ask you
how you felt about that.
Well, lfeel like Apple stock has
been dramatically undervalued.
This would be
a good time to get in.
Your daughter
and her mother...
Chrisann.
...are on welfare.
We're living in
a hovel in Menlo Park.
We can't pay
the heating bills.
She sleeps in a parka.
Your daughter...
She's not my daughter!
Because, as reported
by Time magazine,
I've slept with 28%
of the men in America?
No.
All of them,
exactly nine months
before Lisa was born!
(DOOR OPENS)
I've got Andy here.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Excuse me.
We're there?
Hey, Chris.
CHRISANN: Hey, Andy.
How are you doin'?
Terrible.
STEVE: You guys
caught up now?
Excuse me for saying hello to my
friend who thinks you're a dick.
I don't think you're a...
We're there?
No. It's got a one-in-six
chance of working.
God damn it.
We're not a pit
crew at Daytona.
This can't be fixed
in seconds.
You didn't have seconds,
you had three weeks.
The universe was created
in a third of that time.
Well, someday you'll have to
tell us how you did it.
(CHUCKLES)
Here's what
I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch demo.
I'm gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up.
The bag was designed
by Susan Kare.
The Macintosh font that's
scrolling across the screen
was designed by Steve Capps.
The starry night and
skywriting was Bruce Horn.
MacPaint,
MacWrite, Alice...
Down to the calculator.
And then I'm gonna say, the
voice demo that didn't work
was designed by
Andy Hertzfeld.
(CHUCKLES)
Steve...
Five in six is your chance
of surviving the first round
of Russian roulette,
and you've reversed
those odds.
So unless
you wanna be disgraced
in front of
your friends, family,
colleagues, stockholders,
and the press,
I wouldn't
stand here arguing.
I'd go try and get some more
bullets out of the gun.
Do it, Andy!
Stop. You.
What size shirt do you wear? Me?
Does anyone know
what size shirt he wears?
Does anyone know
what size shirt I wear?
JOANNA: Does anyone know where
the closest psychiatrist is?
The disk fits
in your pocket.
I need a shirt with a breast
pocket, I can take it out onstage.
A shirt?
The disk!
I need a white shirt in my
size with a breast pocket.
Yes. Which one of the no
stores that are open at 8:45
do you want me to have someone run
to and return from in 15 minutes?
Go out in the lobby, find someone my
size who's wearing a white shirt,
tell them I'll trade them
for a free computer,
and they get to
keep my shirt.
Does it have to be a white shirt?
ls blue okay?
No. The Mac is beige,
I'm beige,
the disk is blue,
the shirt has to be white.
Andy?
STEVE: Hello, I'm Macintosh.
Bring me the head
of Andy Hertzfeld.
I tried to get it to say,
"Hello," but it's shy.
Yeah.
So that's it?
STEVE; That's it.
I don't get it.
I know.
What are people
going to do with it?
Lisa, how old are you now?
You know how old she is.
How old are you, Lisa?
Five.
Come sit here for a minute.
Do you know
what this is?
It's a computer.
Can I borrow
your hand for a second?
Point that arrow
and click.
You don't have to, but ifyou
want, you can play with it.
Nothing you can do
will break it,
so just do
whatever you want with it.
What are you doing?
I'm paying you exactly what the
court ordered me to pay you.
$385 a month.
I'm not the one who
decided on that amount.
And I'm asking you
how you feel.
If you feel all right.
If it feels all right to
you that your daughter...
She's not my...
That your daughter
and her mother
are on welfare
while you're worth $441
million for making that.
I'm proud to say Apple donates
computers to underfunded schools,
and we'll be doing more of
the same with the Mac...
What?
Apple donates millions of dollars'
worth of computers to schools.
What does that
have to do with...
Imagine an underprivileged kid that has
their favorite teacher with them 24 hours.
We're minutes away
from being able to do that.
In your head, was that an
answer to my question?
Tell me the question again.
I wasn't the one who sued
you for child support.
No, let...
San Mateo County sued you.
STEVE: No, let me explain
what happened,
because I have
plenty of time right now.
(DOOR OPENS)
Excuse me.
You have a visitor.
Just wanted to say
goodluckl Hey, Chrisann.
Hello, Woz.
Hang on.
(C LEARS TH ROAT)
Just wanted to
say good luck.
Thanks. You, too.
It's a big morning.
Yeah.
You should see
this crowd out there.
This crowd,
it's like, um...
I can't really wait for you to
come up with a metaphor, man.
Yeah. So, uh, listen, I want
to ask you a favor. Yeah?
Can you acknowledge the Apple
ll team in your remarks?
Icannot
Just an acknowledgment.
Have them stand up.
We're launching the Mac.
It'd be a morale booster,
just a mention
so they could get
a round of applause.
Woz...
Just a mention.
Can we stick a pin
in this for a minute?
Sure, yep.
Thank you.
Just talking about an
acknowledgment for the team.
I've got Chrisann in there.
I'll see you in just a second.
Y9K)-
That.
What?
<i>STEVE: You asked me what
people are gonna do with it.</i>
They're gonna do that.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
One of the engineers.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
I'm sorry?
It's an abstract.
(CHUCKLES)
You used MacPaint.
Push that key and the "S"
at the same time.
Now type your name.
(KEYBOARD CLAC KING)
Do you know
which box says "Save"?
Right. Go ahead
and click on it.
I'll put some money
in your account.
And buy you a new house,
someplace near a decent school.
Thank you.
Woz wants a minute.
And Sculley's asking
for you.
We're done?
Could you teach me
more things?
On the computer?
Lisa, wait for me
in the hall, please.
You can put your coat on
in the hall.
Bye, Lisa.
Bye.
CHRISANN: Lisa,
in the hall. Now.
Ijust wanna know,
when you say
you're gonna put
money in my account,
how much we're talking about.
It's a school day.
She needs to be in school.
I'm gonna give you
whatever you need.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Woz wants me to acknowledge
the Apple ll team.
You must be able to see
that she looks like you.
I don't want to
insult Woz.
Ijust think it's backward-looking
at exactly the wrong moment.
I know you heard
what I said.
I heard
what you said, Joanna.
It's just, we're about to
do this thing.
At 9:41, the planet's gonna shift
on its axis, nigh and forever.
Two most significant events
of the 20th century.
The Allies win the War,
and this.
This.
So maybe right now isn't the
very best time to scold me
for not being a better father
to a kid who's not my kid.
The test said I... I don't
care what the test said.
I don't care about 94.1%, or
the insane algorithm you used
to get to 28% of
American men.
I'm buying her a new house.
I'm giving her money.
There's a small girl who
believes you're her father.
That's all. That's all
the math there is.
She believes it. What are
you gonna do about that?
God sent his only son
on a suicide mission,
but we like him anyway
because he made trees.
We're gonna sell a million
units in the first 90 days,
20,000 a month after that.
(SIGHS)
So maybe you could give me
a break, Ms. Hoffman?

Woz.
WOZNIAKI Hey.
There's nothing in that vending
machine that won't kill you.
Just browsing.
STEVE: Let's take a walk.
<i>WOZNIAK: Can I tell you
something?</i>
Yeah. After the meeting in Maui,
the Apple ll team was upset and angry
and down, and do you know why?
Because the Apple ll wasn't
mentioned even once?
The Apple ll
wasn't mentioned...
Yes, that's it.
You have it, yes.
That wasn't an oversight.
They know that.
They know it wasn't.
Look, I don't wanna make
a big deal out of this...
That's entirely
within your power.
The Apple ll is...
The Apple ll is
what was, my friend.
The Apple ll is what pays the bills
around here and has for seven years.
And if you
embarrass these people,
you are going to see a brain drain
at this company, my brother.
Markkula took
you off the Lisa,
not them and not me,
so don't blame...
Markkula took me off the Lisa
because of his strong religious
objection to making it good.
Now, I gave you everything
you wanted on the Apple ll.
You don't ask for a lot? There
wasn't a single fight youlost
Do you concede the slots
are the reason
for the success of
the Apple ll?
We can't possibly still be
talking about the slots.
I have a point.
It's been seven years. The
eight slots on the Apple ll...
You're still doing it, you're
talking about the slots.
There's something
wrong with you.
This argument
started in the garage.
What are you talking about? Why
would you only want two slots?
A printer and a modem.
With eight slots, you...
This is a huge deal that we
were able to add eight slots.
I appreciate the engineering,
but it's not what we're doing.
And thank God I won
that argument... Woz.
...because the open system is what
people love about the machine,
and it's why it sold
and still sells.
An open system. We're not
doing an open system.
Of course we are.
That's what people want, and the
breakthrough on the Apple ll...
People don't know what they
want until you show it to them.
Serious users
want to customize,
they wanna modify,
they wanna jack it up.
They want hardware
engineers like me
to expand its capabilities,
okay?
Keyboards for music,
better sound board,
better display boards,
improved memory cards.
And it's why there are 3,000
people here right now.
The slots are what allowed
the Apple ll to run,
forjust one example, VisiCalc,
which, from my guess,
<i>single-handedly sold between
200,000 and 300,000 machines.</i>
They want slots.
They don't get a vote.
<i>When</i> Dylan <i>wrote
Shelter from the Storm,</i>
he didn't ask people
to contribute to the lyrics.
Plays don't stop so the
playwright can ask the audience
what scene they'd like
to see next.
Painters... We're on the verge of
a tectonic... Hobbyists are...
STEVE: Hobbyists?
A printer and a modem,
two slots.
The Apple ll team
has my affection,
but I'm not loving up a 7-year-old
product at the Mac launch.
WOZNIAK: Computers
aren't paintings.
Fuck you.
I'm gonna say "fuck you"
every time you say that
until you either die or stop.
Steve...
Try it.
Steve.
Say it.
Computers aren't paintings.
Fuck you.
Yes, they are, and what I
want is a closed system.
End-to-end control.
Completely incompatible
with anything.
Computers aren't supposed
to have human flaws.
I'm not going to build
this one with yours.
Steve!
H9)'-
STEVE: Today is about
the Macintosh.
And the Mac is mine.
I give you that.
Thank you.
I give you that.
Just publicly acknowledge
the Apple ll team
becauseifs
the right thing to do.
We'll know soon enough if you are
Leonardo da Vinci orjust think you are,
but in the meantime,
it would be great...
In the meantime,
the Apple ll is done.
Seven years.
It was a great run.
You should go out in the
house and take your seat.
The Mac is Jef Raskin's.
Say it for me.
Computers aren't...
Fuck you.
All right.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
STEVE: We're there?
I need more time.
You can't have it.
Twenty minutes.
It's 8:58.
HERTZFELD: We can start late.
Hear me. We're a computer company.
We can't start late.
Then I have another idea.
What?
It's deceptive and
borderline unethical.
I'm listening.
It'll run on the 512.
You tested it?
Yeah.
Wait.
You're gonna demo
a 128 computer on a 512?
Nobody's gonna know.
And you think that's
"borderline" unethical?
Name my
other choices, please.
Please, you have to tell me why it's
so important for it to say "Hello."
Hollywood, they made
computers scary things.
See how this reminds you
of a friendly face?
That the disk slot
is a goofy grin?
It's warm and it's playful,
and it needs to say "Hello."
ltneedstosay"HeHo"
becauseitcan.
(CROWD CHEERING IN DISTANCE)
We're not committing fraud.
The 512 is gonna ship
in under a year.
Will you absolve me of your
Eastern European disapproval?
The computer in 2001
said "Hello" all the time,
and it still scared
the shit out of me.
Absolve me.
Just for this.
And just for now.
AN <i>NOU</i> NCER: <i>Ladies and

See you

MARKKU <i>LA: And I'm going to take us
through the formal part of the meeting.</i>
<i>The legal part,
if you will.</i>
STEVE: Thank merciful God.
The cavalry's shown up.
SCULLEY: Because I hear you've been
worse than usual this morning.
I didn't think
that was possible,
so I've been dispatched
as the "Steve Whisperer."
This is a '55 Margaux.
It's 9:00 in the morning.
This is a '55 Margaux.
(CHUCKLES)
ls it my imagination, or have
you started to dress like me?
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports.
Instead we should have just
dropped water on the audience.
Just big 10,000-gallon tanks of cold
water, dropped from the ceiling.
Save Mike some money
on index cards.
Oh, just relax.
VVhy?
I don't know. No one's ever
asked me that question.
There you go.
(MARKKULA SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY IN DISTANCE)
You're the only one who sees
the world the same way I do.
No one sees the world
the same way you do.
I'm like Julius Caesar, John.
I'm surrounded by enemies.
No, you're not.
The board...
Oh, "The board."
The board's behind you.
Only because you see
to it they are.
Oh, lthink
it's a good board,
but ifyou want me to push
them out one by one,
we can talk about that.
I want you to
push them out all at once
through a window,
if it's the nearest exit.
The look on their faces
when we showed them the spot.
I couldn't see their faces, because they
were banging their heads on the table.
Yesterday, the day after
it airs once,
the publisher ofAdweek calls it
the best commercial of all time.
Of all time!
And it is.
And if anyone does
one better,
it's gonna be Chiat/Day, who
the board wanted to replace,
and it's gonna be Lee Clow, who the
board thought was out of his mind.

Did we use skinheads

A couple of people
have told me that.
Yeah.
We paid skinheads? I've got

They had a look

The skinheads?
Yeah.

<i>MAN: On January 24th,</i>

SCULLEY: Who else knows?
Who else knows what?
That we paid terrorists
to be in our TV commercial.
John.
They were wrong about the ad,
but they're a good board.
Good people.
Their only problem... Their
problem is that they're people.
People.
The very nature of people
is something to be overcome.
When lwas running Pepsi,
we had a lot of success
focusing on 18- to 55-year-olds
who weren't members
of violent hate groups.
I get it. You're not
surrounded by enemies.
(SIGHS)
We're almost there.
I'm back and forth
on the Dylan.
I might quote
a different verse.
SCULLEY: What are the choices?
"For the loser now will be later
to win," which is what we have.
Or?
"Come mothers and fathers
throughout the land,
"and don't criticize
what you can't understand.
"Your sons
and your daughters..."
"...are beyond
your command."
ljust lost a hundred bucks
to Andy Hertzfeld.
He said you'd change it
to that verse.
We got 45 seconds. I want to
use it to ask you a question.
Why do people
who are adopted
feel like they were rejected
instead of selected?
That came out of nowhere.
"Your sons and your daughters
are beyond your command.
"Your old road
is rapidly aging."
So go fuck yourself, because
my name is Steve Jobs,
and "the times
they are a-changing."
I don't feel rejected.
You're sure?
Very sure.
Because it's not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say,
"Nah, we're not interested
in this one."
On the other hand,
someone did choose you.
It's having no control.
You find out
you were out of the loop
when the most crucial events in
your life were set in motion.
As long as you have control.
I don't understand people
who give it up.
What inspired Hertzfeld
to make that bet?
He was warning me
that being your father figure
could be dangerous.
Keep your 100 bucks.
I'm sticking with
the first verse.
Good.
What the hell does he mean?
Nothing.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you, boss.

GEORGE: All right,

We're gonna have to go up

STEVE: Just one,

If they were respectful, we'd all

Yes.
You said you wouldn't

So, I think it's cool
they're here.
They're suing me.

You know, I'm the one who has
to explain you to people.
$100,000 to Paul Rand
for a corporate logo,
when we didn't even know
what our company made.
A $650,000 mold
for the Cube

be 90.1 instead of 90.
I forbid the angles to
be 90.1 instead of 90.
That box could be on display

(BLUES ROCK lvluslc
PLAYING ON RADIO)
I thought you went to school.
Hang on.
You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago. lthoughtyoulefi.
I didn't wake up my mom
on time this morning.
It's happened before, too.
I wake up with the alarm, and then
I get dressed and eat breakfast,
but sometimes I forget to see
what time it is after that.
Why doesn't your mom just
set her own alarm clock?
It's one of
my chores.
I don't understand what that has
to do with why you're still...
Where's your mother?
LISA: She went to find
a payphone.
An hour ago, she said...
You don't have to
raise your hand.
You said it was off
by a little.
It is.
Ijust measured it.
Joanna“.
Exactly a foot
on all four sides.
There are six sides. But you're
not supposed be here right now.
We know if four of the sides
are equal to each other,
the other two must be
equal as well.
The top, bottom,
right, and left
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back.
They're not,
I measured them.
Lisa, I'm kind of
an expert in design.
And that's a 20-cent ruler. You think
there's a chance it could be off?
If I had another ruler,
I would measure this ruler,
but I really doubt
it's off.
When your mother
comes back,
you have to go to school.
Because it's a ruler!
Why is it off?
Did you hear what I just said?
Yes.
Because sometimes
it seems like you just
keep saying what you want
without listening.
I'm listening.
Is there something
you need?
No.
Why isn't it
a perfect cube?
You've asked me before.
I forget what it is.
It's an optical anomaly.
To the human eye, a perfect
cube doesn't look like a cube,
so we made it roughly a millimeter
shorter than a foot on two sides.
What's an anomaly?
You've asked me
that before, too.
I don't know why
you keep doing that.
It's an exception. Something
that doesn't fit a pattern.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
You have to go to school.
Come in!
(DOOR OPENS)
I think you two
have met.
Hello, old friend.
You look well.
So do you.
So do you.
And they're telling me George is
ready for you to look at the focus.
STEVE: Take a walk with me.
Is this Lisa?
Yeah.
This can't be Lisa.
STEVE: It is.
Lisa's this big. They get taller.
Come on.
Do you remember me?
She doesn't.
I'm your dad's friend,
Steve Wozniak.
I apologize,
I don't remember you.
You're very polite.
Woz?
Yeah.
STEVE: Chrisann's at a payphone.
Would you find her?
JOANNA: Yeah.
(DOOR OPENS)
STEVE: Good turnout.
WOZNIAK: Great turnout.
Yeah.
"Insanely great."
(CHUCKLES) Insanely great.
You know, this is the first time we
haven't played for the same team.
It's like you're releasing
your first solo album.
I appreciate your
inviting me to the launch.
Ijust want to wipe
the slate clean.
That's exactly what I want.
That's why I came backstage.
I want you to know
I'll be out there with you.
Any chance I can get you to
go out there instead of me?
(CHUCKLES)
I love you, Steve.
I love you, too, Woz.
WOZNIAK: You know, some things were said.
They were.
They were said in public.
They were published.
Were you pressured
to do it?
WOZNIAKI Was I what?
STEVE: Check it out.
It's the orchestra pit
for the San Francisco Opera.
Was I pressured
to do it?
I once met Seiji
Ozawa at Tanglewood.
A thunderous conductor.
Godly artfulness
and nuance.
And I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome can't.
Surprisingly, he...
He didn't beat
the living shit out of you?
That's right. No, he said,
"The musicians play
their instruments.
"L play the orchestra."
That feels like something that sounds
good, but doesn't mean anything.
Markkula, Sculley. They ask you
to slag me off in the press?
I had reason
to be angry.
Did they?
Absolutely not.
But they asked you
to talk.
Apple was under siege,
you'd just left the company.
Someone had to talk
to the press.
I'm right here, Woz.
The company left me.
L begg€d YOU-
l begg€d YOU-
The Apple ll accounted
for 70% of the revenue.
What did you think
was gonna happen?
You didn't care enough about
the Apple ll or the Lisa.
Let's be really clear.
I didn't care at all about
the Apple ll or the Lisa.
I wasn't pressured
to do it.
What I said to the press
was an honest, iftempered,
reflection of what lbeheved.
Woz.
Yeah?
What the fuck
is on your wrist?
You wanna know?
I literally can't wait.
Everyone's gonna be
wearing these in 10 years.
It's a Nixie Watch,
made using Nixie tubes.
This is actually
40-year-old technology.
Cold-cathode tubes. They're
operating at 140 volts.
I tilt my wrist 45 degrees,
it's right there.
Hours, minutes,
and seconds.
The way our minds work.
Look at that.
Do me a favor.
Set the watch ahead like you're on a
plane and just changed time zones.
Not a problem.
Unscrew that,
just hit the button.
Excuse me,
flight attendant,
the man next to me would appear
to be detonating a bomb.
You think this looks
like a bomb.
Even right now,
I'm not 100% sure it isn't.
(BUZZING)
I think maybe once people
get used to it...
No.
I was angry.
You were saying things
about the Apple ll,
and the way you were
treating the team...
Woz.
You get a free pass
for life.
I got to get back onstage.
We got, like, two minutes
of rehearsal time left.
Do you understand how
condescending that just was?
Maybe you don't.
I don't want to see you
get dragged off
an airplane in
plastic handcuffs.
I get a free pass
for life from you?
(SCOFFS)
You give out the passes?
You give them to me?
You're gonna have a stroke,
little buddy.
What did you do?
Why has Lisa
not heard of me?
Shit, man, how many
fourth-graders have heard of you?
You can't write code.
You're not an engineer.
You're not a designer.
You can't put
a hammer to a nail.
I built the circuit board.
The graphical
interface was stolen
from Xerox PARC.
Jef Raskin was the leader
of the Mac team
before you threw him off
his own project.
Everything! Someone else
designed the box.
So, how come 10 times in a day I
read "Steve Jobs is a genius"?
What do you do?
I play the orchestra.
And you're a good musician.
You sit right there. You're
the best in your row.
WOZNIAK: I came here
to clear the air!
Do you know
why I came here?
Didn't you just
answer that?
I came here because
you're gonna get killed.
Your computer's gonna fail.
You had a college and
university advisory board
telling you they need a powerful
workstation for $2,000 to $3,000.
You've priced NeXT
at $6,500.
And that doesn't include the
optional $3,000 hard drive,
which people will discover
isn't optional.
Because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything.
And the $2,500 laser printer
brings the total
to $12,000.
And, in the entire world,
you are the only person who cares
that it's housed in a perfect cube.
You're gonna get killed.
And I came here to stand next
to you while that happens
because that's what
friends do.
That's what men do.
I don't need your "pass."
We go back, so don't talk to
me like I'm other people.
I'm the only one
that knows
that this guy here
is someone you invented.
I'm standing by you because that
perfect cube, that does nothing,
is about to be
the single biggest failure
in the history of
personal computing.
Tell me something else
I don't know.
Back onstage?
We're out of time. They've got to
mop the stage and open the house.
If it crashes,
it crashes, right?
You'll make a joke.
I'll make ajoke.
If it crashes,
it crashes.
It's a good slogan. "NeXT.
If it crashes, it crashes."
I'm notjust talking
about the demo, Steve.
If it tanks,
we don't swallow cyanide.
We go back to
the drawing board.
No more drawing boards.
Invent the Edsel twice, you don't
get any more drawing boards.
Tell me
what the plan is.
You have to tell me the
plan, because I don't know.
You're walking around like
you've got "can't lose" cards.
The plan will reveal itself to
you when you're ready to see it.
Will I have to drop acid?
Couldn't hurt.
Is there a plan?
Have I ever let you down?
Every single goddamn time.
Then I'm due.
Is there?
Joanna, there's a plan.
I just don't wanna put you in a
position where you're lying to people.
(SIGHS)
Start 15 minutes late
so Avie can recompile
and give us
a fighting chance.
Jesus Christ! How many times
are we gonna have this...
We're not starting late ever!
Fine!
We're not ever starting late!
"...ever starting late."
But where do you come down
on starting late?
(SNAPS FINGERS)
Lisa's been
doing this thing
where she asks me about stuff
I've already told her.
She asks me questions, and I know
she already knows the answers.
What's that about?
JOANNA: Kids do that
when they're scared
one of their parents
is in a bad mood.
They try to get you talking
about something you like.
It's very common
and can be treated
by talking to her
about things she likes.
Do you have any experience
or training in this field?
No.
Tell them to open the house.
Where's Lisa?
She's around.
STEVE: What does that mean?
CHRISANN: She's running
around the building.
STEVE: An hour ago, you said
you were taking her to school.
CHRISANN: She begged me
to let her stay.
There are fathers
who would so love...
It is wrong, okay? It is morally
wrong, it's parentally wrong.
It is wrong for you to use Lisa as
a way of getting money from me.
She'll know,
if she doesn't already,
that that is your
primary use for her.
And she will hate you
for the rest of your life.
She will see,
if she doesn't already,
that her mother is a woman who
stands up to men. (WATER SPLASHING)
STEVE: By living off
of them.
By not letting myself be
imprisoned and degraded by them.
(FLUSHES TOILET)
Imprisoned?
I can't get rid of you.
I need a doctor,
and I need a dentist.
I dropped out of college after a
semester, but, okay, let's have a look.
You will support your
daughter and her mother.
Did you pay someone $1,500
to bless your house?
Did you hear what I said?
Did you?
I don't remember
how much itwas, Steve.
Itwas $1,500.
They don't do it
for free.
They don't.
They charge $1,500.
How I spend...
Fuck. You know what?
I'm not even...
Were you about to say, "How I spend
my money is none of your business"?
I have a sinus infection, and
I need to see a dentist, too.
So you can see how your "blessing"
budget could have been better spent.
Like on a perfect cube?
Look at me, Chrisann.
What?
You know
who I am, right?
Yes.
And you know
I know people.
What are you talking about?
Look at me.
And you know the people I
know, they know people.
What is this?
If I ever hear again
that you've thrown
a cereal bowl
at Lisa's head...
What? ...my private
line's gonna ring.
And a voice on the other end
is gonna say, "We're all set."
That's how I'll learn that you're dead.
Are you...
I threw the bowl
on the floor.
I didn't throw it
atherhead.
She wasn't even
in the room!
She was nowhere...
I threw the bowl
on the floor.
She's a little girl.
You're scaring her.
I'm a grown man.
You're scaring me.
Taking out the garbage
is a chore.
Clearing the table
is a chore.
Waking you up in the morning
is just fucking creepy.
Please teach me more
about being a parent.
We're all done here.
It means so much coming from
someone who won't admit he is one.
Stop screaming at Lisa.
I give her responsibilities!
Got it. And one day she's
gonna thank me for it!
Probably in your sleep.
Fuck off!
0K3)'-
(DOOR OPENS) I never... I never
threw anything at her head!
Steve...
I never would.
Things don't become so
because you say so.
There'll be more money in your
account by the end of business.
(SOBS)
Were you being nice?
Oh, yeah.
(sossnue)
<i>JOANNA: Andy's next.</i>
Hertzfeld or Cunningham?
Hertzfeld.
He's playing with Avie Tevanian
on the computer backstage.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
<i>WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the house is now open.</i>
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
...playing in front
of thousands of people.
Steve!
Can he do it later, Joel?
We go in eight minutes.
Can ljust get a quick reaction
to the press this morning?
What about it? The size
of it, the volume.
I'll tell you
on background...
I was hoping for
a quote from Steve.
I'll tell you
on background
that I've never seen anything
like it in the tech industry.
I called
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>
to take out
a full-page ad for today,
and do you know what
their sales guy said?
"Why bother? It'd be like notifying
Macy's that tomorrow is Christmas."
You saw the Stewart Alsop
newsletter?
Idid.
I'm sorry, Joanna, I need
to get Steve on the record.
The headline was, "Dear NeXT,
when can I get my machine?"
When can he?
We'll announce the ship date
in the next eight to 10 weeks.
Alsop's not talking
about the ship date.
He wants to know when he
can get one to play with.
We have a lot of
respect for Stewart Alsop,
and we want to get
a machine into his hands
so he can tell
his subscribers about it.
When will that be?
Very soon.
A couple of days?
A week? Off the record.
(TURNS OFF)
Off the record?
Completely.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
We think...
He'll get it
when it's finished.
It's not finished?
STEVE: It's almost finished.
I've been watching you rehearse
the demo for three weeks.
STEVE: Yeah.
What's left?
STEVE: A little thing.
What?
I think that's...
We're off the record, and Joel's always
been good at understanding nuance.
What's left to finish?
I guess, in layman's terms, you'd
have to say we don't have an OS.
An operating system?
Yeah.
JOEL: What do you mean?
Well, the OS is
what runs the computer.
In fact, it sort of
is the computer.
How has it been running? How's
it gonna run this morning?
What do you mean,
you don't have an OS?
STEVE: It's like this.
<i>Avie Tevanian is our
Chief Software Designer,</i>
<i>and he wrote</i> a <i>demo program.</i>
<i>It's like we built</i>
a <i>great car,</i>
<i>but we haven't built
the engine.</i>
<i>So we put</i> a <i>golf-cart battery in there
to make it go for</i> a <i>little bit.</i>
All this computer knows how to do
right now is demonstrate itself.
You're telling me the only thing
you've built is a black cube?
Yes. Yeah.
But isn't it the coolest
black cube you've ever seen?
Is this...
We're off the record.
Is this a strategy or a problem,
because if it's a problem...
Do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man.
It's not a problem.
I wouldn't
understand it anyway.
I don't understand it either,
and my name's on the patents.
It's got email.
STEVE: Well, email's notjust
for tech specialists anymore.
Well, it is,
but it won't be.
And I assume an email sent
on a NeXT computer
can only be received
by a NeXT computer?
Closed, end-to-end.
The new trash can is wrong.
I wanna tell you I appreciate
all the hours you put into it,
but I can't because
of how terrible it is.
Go back to the other one.
And why are we still giving
three options on the clock?
How many options
do you wanna give?
Two. "Buy it"
or "Don't."
Can I talk to you for a second?
Abso-fruitly.
Uh, look, man,
Avie's been recompiling,
but he says
there may be some
glitches this morning.
If all there are,
are some glitches,
it'll be a triumph of
miraculous magnitude.
Why are you
translating for Avie?
HERTZFELD: I didn't want him
to find out the hard way
your position on
glitches in a demo,
but it sounds like
you've mellowed.
I've been growing, Andy. I've
been learning to love myself.
Mmm, lwouldn't have ever
dreamed that was a problem.
Fantastic burn.
You need to go to your seat.
How about Lisa, getting into
a school for gifted kids?
STEVE: Yeah, she was tested,
and it turns out she can fly.
HERTZFELD: But, seriously,
it's a big deal.
I know it's a big deal. That's why
I built the school a building.
Well, I'm sure
that's not why she got in.
Really?
Can I show you something
funny from Macworld?
I can't think of anything
I have to do right now.
It'll make you
feelgood.
HERTZFELD: Joanna!
Look at this!
Oh, Andy, he's only got
a couple of minutes.
It's Guy Kawasaki writing in Macworld.
You're gonna like this.
Well, can we all
enjoy it later?
He wrote a parody press release about
Apple buying NeXT for your OS.
He imagines a near future,
where Apple needs your OS
and has to buy NeXT,
and you come back as CEO.
He has Gates saying, "There would
now be more innovations from Jobs
"that Microsoft could copy."
You can read it later.
Thanks.
She would've gotten in without
you donating a building.
Still, it's something to
talk about in the interview.
(SIGHS)
All right. Good luck.
Thanks.
Give that to me. I'll
throw it out for you.
I'm gonna hang on to it.
What?
What?
You ready for Sculley?
Excuse me! Lisa!
You can't shout!
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Lisa?
You have to go.
It's dangerous up here. That's
why I make other people do it.
Who are you hiding from,
me or your mom?
I'm not hiding.
Let's go.
What were you
listening to?
I'm listening to two
versions of the same song.
And then,
when I get to the end,
I rewind to listen
to them again.
It's the same song, but the
versions are different.
What's the song?
Okay.
So, it's a really old song, and
it's called <i>Both</i> Sides, Now.
<i>"Both Sides, NOW"?</i>
Yeah.
What's it about?
It's about... There are three verses.
Clouds, love, and life.
And the person singing is singing
that they used to think of...
That they used
to think about...
Clouds, love, and life?
Right. One way, yeah, but now they
look at them another way, and they...
They've come to
the conclusion that
they really don't know clouds,
love, or life at all.
Those are the exact words.
Yeah, Joni Mitchell,
'cause it's not a really old song,
unless I'm a really old guy.
You have to go
to school now.
Do you want me to tell you the
differences between the two versions?
Right now.
The first version is the kind of
thing that you would call girlish.
I didn't mean I want to know
the difference right now.
I meant you have to
go to school right now.
I can stay and watch.
You are truant.
You're committing a crime.
I'm not gonna miss
anything important.
How do you know?
I read ahead.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
The Pilgrims make it
to the New World.
Then, the Declaration
of Independence.
Yeah, you skipped
a couple of centuries.
Steve?
Chrisann's out there.
(CROWD APPLAUDING
AND CHEERING)
STEVE: Let's go!
Can I make my case
for staying?
Nope.
(CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING)
She was with me.
Come on. Your dad
doesn't want us to stay.
That's not true.
That's not...
You have to be
in school, is all.
I'm committing
a crime right now,
and I don't
wanna get in trouble.
You're not in trouble.
I was kidding.
0K3)'-
Hey. What was
the second version?
You said the first version was
girlish, what was the second version?
I can't really
think of the word.
Okay. Well,
have a good day at school.
"Regretful."
What?
Like, wishing you could go
back and do things different.
You're too young
to be regretful.
Not me.
The person
singing the song.
Got it. "Regretful."
That makes sense because...
I wanna live with you.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Six minutes.
You want to see Sculley?
No.
SCULLEY: You know all those times
I told you, you needed security?
Here's why.
STEVE: I don't know how it is I've
gotten older and you haven't.
Some deal with the devil
I was never offered.
So, you know what I've been
thinking for the last four years?
As it turns out, John, I've never
known what you were thinking.
No newborn baby
has control.
Do you know what
I'm talking about?
In '84, before the Mac launch.
You said...
Yeah.
You said that being adopted
meant you didn't have control.
We're starting
in a minute, so...
Why do people think
I fired you?
It's fine, John.
It's all behind us.
SCULLEYI IS <i>it?</i>
Hmm?
Don't play stupid.
You can't pull it off.
You came here to ask me why
people think you fired me?
Why do people think
I fired you?
Just confirm
something for me, okay?
You liked the ad.
Right? The commercial,
<i>1984.</i> You liked it.
SCULLEY: When are you
gonna get furniture?
STEVE: It's nOt
an easy process.
SCULLEY: lt is. You buy a
couch, take it from there.
I'd be really surprised
ifyou came here
to talk about
interior decorating.
I liked the ad very much.
You did?
You know I did.
You're a lying son of a
bitch who tried to kill it.
It's time to take
a hard look at the Mac.
It's past time.
It's overpriced.
We need to drop it to $1,995. We
need to double the marketing budget,
put more bodies on an internal hard
drive and invest in FileServer.
Where the hell did you get the
idea that I tried to kill...
Lee Clow.
Lee's wrong.
He's lying?
He's mistaken.
SCULLEY: Where would
the money come from?
It would come from finally
getting rid of the Apple ll.
The Apple ll is the only
thing making money.
You agreed with the board.
I understood the board's
concerns, but I...
The board's concerns that
we didn't show the product?
Among other things,
but my question was...
What other things? Honestly, I'm
just asking 'cause I'm curious.
You said
"among other things."
Among other things. It was
set in a dystopian galaxy.
It took place on a planet
where we don't live.
It was dark, and the
opposite of our brand.
And we didn't show
the product.
People talked about the ad, but most of
them didn't know what we were selling.
The Mac needs
to sell for $1,995.
There is no market
research telling us
that the Mac is failing
because it's overpriced.
It's telling us that
people don't like it
because they think it
doesn't do anything.
It's closed, end-to-end.
We didn't know it wasn't what
people wanted, but it isn't.
They want slots, they want
choices, they want options.
The way we buy stereos,
mix and match components.
John, listen to me.
Whoever said the customer
is always right was,
I promise you, a customer.
It had skinheads in it.
She was liberating them.
Liberating the skinheads.
The ad didn't have anything
to do with fucking skinheads!
We used them as
fucking extras.
Nobody even knows
they were skinheads!
I'm just saying,
the board had concerns...
You invented
lifestyle advertising.
And "our brand"
was my brand.
Myjob is to make a
recommendation to the board.
We showed a lot of happy
people drinking Pepsi.
We didn't say the world was going
to end ifyou bought a Dr. Pepper!
Recommend that
we drop the price
and double
the marketing budget.
I can't.
And we showed the product!
We showed it being opened,
we showed it being poured,
being consumed!
What are you gonna do? Recommend
that we kill the Mac?
I already have, Steve.
What?
VVhen?
You think the secret to
yoursuccess
was not assuming people knew
what to do with a can of soda?
I didn't kill
the ad, Steve!
I'm the only reason
it made it on the air!
Just now.
An hour ago, I'm coming
from Markkula's house.
What did he say?
What did he say?
Invent something new.
I'll give you a team,
you can sit in Maui.
The resorts come
with couches.
Wait a minute. Are you saying you
recommended terminating the Mac?
Or you recommended taking me
off the Mac team?
We bought three spots
in the Super Bowl.
Two 30s and a 60.
And after we screened it, the
board wanted that money back,
and they asked me to
sell off the spots.
Chiat/Day sold off the
two 30s, but not the 60,
and I let it be known
to Lee Clow
that if he didn't try
very hard
to sell the last spot,
I wouldn't be unhappy.
Ifwe drop the price
and double the budget...
You can't drop the price
or double the budget!
I mean, the only way to do that is
to take money out of the Apple ll.
The Apple ll should embarrass you.
lt embarrasses me.
It doesn't embarrass
the shareholders.
I don't give a shit
about the shareholders!
That's why I hired you, so I don't
ever have to hear about shareholders!
The shareholders
are my problem,
and the board represents
the shareholders!
That's how it works!
You sure it wasn't Lee Clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60?
At my direction, Steve.
You think he would have done that
on his own, taken it on himself?
Yeah. I think he would've done
what it took to save it from you.
I was the only thing
protecting it!
You didn't want the ad
because you were trying to kill the
Mac two months before it launched!
You are fucking delusional!
(SIGHS)
Can I mention something to you?
Sure.
I have no earthly idea
why you're here.
The story of why
and how you left Apple,
which is quickly becoming
mythologized, isn't true.
I'm gonna take this
to the board myself.
Don't do that.
lam doing that.
You can't.
VVhy?
They believe you're no longer
necessary to this company.
I get hate mail.
<i>Death threats.</i>
I get death threats!
<i>My kids are getting taunted.</i>
Why do people think
I fired you?
Joanna's gonna call
my name in a second.
JOANNA: Steve?
That was unrehearsed.
STEVE: Yeah, I'll be there
in just a second!
I gave you
your day in court.
You "gave" me? I gave the
board a clear choice.
I said, "Do you want to invest
in the Apple ll or the Mac?"
And they chose
the Apple ll.
The same people who wanted
to dump the Super Bowl spot.
And then I got on
a plane to China.
Mr. Sculley, there's a call
for you on Line 1.
Or I almost got on a plane,
because I got a call inthelounge.
Who made that call?
Doesn't matter.
<i>STEVE: It matters to me.
Who made the call?</i>
John Sculley.
MAN: <i>John, if you get
on that plane,</i>
<i>you'll have lost your job
by the time it lands.</i>
<i>Steve's been calling the board.
He wants you out.</i>
<i>SCULLEY: I left my bags
on the plane.</i>
<i>My shit's still somewhere
in Beijing.</i>
I took a car back to Cupertino in
the middle of the fucking night.
I know what time it is.
I need a quorum here in one hour,
and lwant Steve here, too.
<i>STEVE: You took me off the
Mac, and it was bad business.</i>
The quorum call
was a homicide.
Right there! That's the part
that's bullshit, my friend.
It was a suicide, because
you knew your cards,
and I showed you mine.
I showed you mine,
and you did it anyway.
What did you think
I was going to do?
I'm okay losing,
but I'm not gonna forfeit.
I'm not okay losing.
<i>SCULLEY: We're losing
market share,</i>
<i>and the Mac is losing money.</i>
Our only hope is the Apple
ll, which is stagnating
because of its
soon-to-be obsolete DOS.
Users are already rigging their machines
to run with a CP/M operating system
that's been built
to run on Intel.
I can't put it
more simply than this.
We need to put our resources
into updating the Apple ll.
<i>STEVE: By taking resources
from the Mac.</i>
<i>SCULLEY: It's failing.
That's</i> a <i>fact.</i>
STEVE: It's overpriced. There's
no evidence that it's...
I'm the evidence!
I'm the world's leading
expert on the Mac, John.
What's your resume?
You're issuing
contradictory instructions,
you're insubordinate,
you make people miserable,
our top engineers are
fleeing to Sun, Dell, HP.
<i>Wall Street doesn't know
who's driving the bus.</i>
We've lost hundreds
of millions in value,
and I'm the CEO
ofApple, Steve.
That's my resume.
But before that, you sold
carbonated sugar water, right?
I sat in a fucking garage with
Wozniak and invented the future.
Because artists lead and hacks
ask for a show of hands!
All right. Well,
this guy's out of control.
I'm perfectly willing to hand
in my resignation tonight,
but if you want me to stay,
you can't have Steve.
Settle him out.
He can keep a share of stock,
so he gets our newsletter.
<i>He'll have to sever
his connection to Apple.</i>
I'm dead serious. I want the
secretary to call for a vote.
I fucking dare you.
You have done an outstanding
job over the years
of cultivating the press, and by
that I mean manipulating them
because none of them,
none of their editors,
none of their editors'
publishers, to this day,
know that you forced it.
<i>That you forced the board.</i>
<i>Even afterl told you
exactly what they'd do,</i>
which is exactly
what they did.
Unanimously.
I don't have any trouble
remembering that, John,
because of it being
the worst night of my life.
And I forced the vote because
I believed I was right.
I still believe I'm right.
And I'm right.
Now, I bled that night.
<i>And I don't bleed.</i>
<i>But time's done its thing.</i>
<i>And I really haven't thought
about it in</i> a <i>while.</i>
I absolutely understand
why you're upset.
<i>And I want people
to know the truth, too.</i>
<i>JOANNA: It's time.</i>
Got it.
You're gonna end me,
aren't you?
STEVE: You're being
ridiculous.
I'm gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself.
Then I'm gonna order a nice
meal with a '55 Margaux,
and sign some autographs.
Jesus Christ...
You want some advice,
Pepsi Generation?
Don't send Woz out to slap me
around in the press.
Anybody else.
You, Markkula, Arthur Rock.
Anyone but Rain Man.
Don't manipulate him
like that.
Whatever you may think,
I'm always gonna protect him.
Come on, Steve.
That's what men do.
We can't start late.
I don't think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder.
Did you know,
back at Bandley
the Mac team gave
an award every year
to the person who could
stand up to you?
No.
JOANNA: I won.
Three years in a row.
Cool.
This... This...
This Guy Kawasaki
in Macworld...
He accidentally
got it right, didn't he?
You've been dragging
your feet on the NeXT OS
until you can figure out
what Apple's going to need.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Even if that were true, it doesn't
sound that diabolical to me.
STAGE MANAGER:
Hey. We're ready for you!
(RUMBLING)
I'm your closest confidante,
your best friend.
Your thing...
What do you call it?
Your "work wife."
The whole time!
The last three years...
When did you change
your mind
and start building the Steve
Jobs Revenge Machine?
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
STAGE MANAGER:
House to half.
Do you remember Skylab?
It was an unmanned satellite
NASA sent up in the early '70s
on a data-gathering mission.
The thing is,
when they sent it up,
they didn't know yet how they
were going to get it back.
<i>But they felt like
they were close enough</i>
<i>that in the eight years it was going
to be up there, they'd figure it out.</i>
STAGE MANAGER:
They're on their way now.
STEVE: They didn't.
So, after eight years,
it came crashing down in a 1,000-mile
swath across the Indian Ocean.
<i>A little to the left,</i>
a <i>little to the right,</i>
<i>somebody could
have gotten hurt.</i>
I really wanted to build
a computer for colleges.
The technology just didn't catch
up as fast as I needed it to.
<i>And you know
we're out of money.</i>
MAN: <i>Ladies and gentlemen, the program
will be starting momentarily.</i>
<i>STEVE: But then, Apple stopped
innovating, and I saw something better.</i>
Joanna, I know schools
aren't going to buy
a $13,000 dictionary
with good speakers.
You know I know that.
ButApple will.
Because Avie Tevanian is going to
build them exactly the OS they need.
<i>They're going to
have to buy me, too.</i>
For half a billion
dollars in stock,
and end-to-end control
on every product.

We think that's legal?
No, we're very certain
it's not.
You want to see
some quotes?
Let's hold off on those.
No, he'll like them.
(MOUTHING)
I'll show them
to you later.
I'll take them now.
(WHISPERS) I'm sorry.
Pick it up
from there, please.
We only have a couple of minutes,
so let's just do the 360.
STEVE: We're going to bring out a
wireless camera we stole from Panasonic.
(ALL LAUGH)
I'll show you
what this looks like.
The whole thing is translucent.
You can see into it.
(MAN WHISTLES)
How's that
for a compromise, Woz?
You still can't get into it,
but you can see into it.
Fair enough.
We put stereo speakers in
front, infrared right up here.
CD-ROM drive in the middle.
ALL: Nice.
Dual stereo headphone jacks,
and all the connectors
are inside
one beautiful
little door, here.
(ALL EXCLAIM)
Ethernet, USB.
Even though this is a full-blooded
Macintosh, we're targeting it
for the number-one use the consumers
tell us they want a computer for.
Which is... STAGE MANAGER:
Let's hold it, please!
Hold it.
The answer was "the
lnternet." (ALL LAUGH)
Joanna?
Yeah.
Just stand in front of me.
I want to look at these quotes,
but I don't want Joel to know.
They're all great.
"It is not only the coolest-looking
computer introduced in years,
"but a chest-thumping
statement
"that Silicon Valley's original dream
company is no longer somnambulant."
It's a word. It means "sleepwalking."
STAGE MANAGER: Steve?
I'm sorry, we have to clear the house
ifwe're going to start on time.
We're absolutely starting on time.
We're going to start on time.
Here, take this.
Everybody, that's it.
They've got to mop the stage,
reset, and open the house.
I love you guys.
(ALL CHEERING)
Andy, come on back
a minute.
Which one?
STEVE: Hertzfeld.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
STEVE: <i>Forbes</i> calls it
an industry-altering success.
Look here.
Why haven't we ever
slept together?
We're not in love. Look.
STEVE: Sculley.
JOANNA: Look what he said.
"He has implemented
the same simple strategy
"that made Apple so
successful 15 years ago.
"Make hit products and promote
them with terrific marketing."
That was nice of him.
It was.
I meant it.
Sightings of J.D. Salinger are
more common than John Sculley.
I wasn't being sarcastic.
ltwas nice of him.
Do you talkto him?
No.
You haven't talked
to him since '88?
I'd have told you
if I did.
Doesn't matter.
I don't want people thinking
they can cross me
and then, boom, 15 years
later, I'm cool with it.
I was kidding.
What's wrong with you
this morning?
Let's get off the stage.
"The only thing Apple's providing
now is leadership in colors."
Don't worry about it.
What does Bill Gates
have against me?
I don't know. You're both
out of your minds.
Listen to me.
He dropped out of a better
school than I dropped out of.
But he's a tool bag.
I'll tell you why.
Make everything
all rightwith Lisa.
You know, Joanna?
Boundaries.
You've come to my apartment at 1:00 a.m.
and cleaned it.
So tell me where
the boundary is.
There. Let's say it's there.
(SIGHS)
If I give you some
real projections,
will you promise not to
repeat them from the stage?
What do you mean,
"Real projections"?
What have you been
giving me?
Conservative projections.
Marketing's been
lying to me?
We've been managing expectations
so that you don't not.
What are
the real projections?
We're going to sell a million
units in the first 90 days.
(BANGS ON TABLE)
20,000 a month after that.
Holy shit!
Yeah.
You see? You wait
long enough, and...
What's more,
32% of the sales
are going to go to people buying
a computer for the first time.
And 12% are going to people using
some kind of Windows machine.
That's what Bill Gates
has against you.
And it'll be the fastest-selling
computer in history.
You brought the company
back from life support
after going through the misery
of laying off 3,000 people
and cutting 70% of
the product line.
So, Steven,
it's over.
You're going to win.
It would be criminal
not to enjoy this moment.
I'm enjoying it.
Make things
all right with Lisa.
You know...
Come on.
Idon%Hke having less privacy
than other people have.
Does being a multi-billionaire
take some of the sting off that?
No.
All Lisa did... All Lisa
did was give her blessing.
Chrisann sold
the house and...
JOANNA: And Lisa could have
done what?
How was she supposed to stop her
mother from selling her own house?
Thatlbought
for the two of them.
How was she supposed
to stop her?
Voicing an objection would have
been a step in the right direction.
You don't think you're having
a bizarre overreaction
to a 19-year-old girl allowing her
mother to list her own house?
She could've tried.
How is she supposed to stop her
mother, that particular mother...
She gave Chrisann her
blessing to sell the house,
and she did it to spite me!
I don't care if she put a pipe
bomb in the water heater!
You're going to
fix it, now.
She's been acting weird for months.
She's turned on me.
Fix it.
What the...
Fix it, Steve.
Take it easy!
Fix it or I quit.
How about that?
I quit and you never see me again.
How about that?
Tell me what's wrong
with you this morning.
What's been wrong
with me for 19 years.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
I've been a witness, and I
tell you I've been complicit.
I love you, Steve.
You know how much.
I love that you don't care how
much money a person makes,
you care what they make.
Butwhat you make isn't supposed
to be the best part of you.
When you're a father,
that's what's supposed to be
the best part of you.
And it's caused me two decades of
agony, Steve, that it is for you
the worst.
(SIGHS)
It's a little thing.
It's a very small thing.
(SNIFFLES) Fix it.
Fix it now, or you can
contact me at my newjob,
working anywhere I want.
I don't happen to think
it is a little deal.
She knew that...
JOANNA: No.
I bought the house for
the two of... No.
What do you mean, "No"?
I mean, no.
The house has nothing to do
with why you're angry at Lisa.
I assure you,
the house has everything
to do with why
I'm angry at Lisa.
Have you ever heard the phrase
"reality distortion field"?
Yes.
As in, "Steve's
reality distortion field"?
I've heard it.
I've read it.
It's been sung
to me by Joan Baez.
What you call
a reality distortion field,
and I'm pretty sure you're the
one who coined the phrase,
is the reason we're here.
I know that.
If I traded in my
bank account for a dollar
every time somebody told me
something was impossible,
I'd come out ahead.
I know that, too.
What's the problem?
My problem?
It sure isn't the house.
Jo, I...
It's that you told her you weren't
going to pay for Harvard.
That child. That
earnest, un-ironic kid.
She told you I wasn't
paying her tuition?
I should have hit you with
something heavy a long time ago.
Lisa told you I wasn't
paying her tuition?
Andy told me that.
Which one?
Hertzfeld.
How would Hertzfeld know?
He wrote Harvard a check for
$25,000 to cover the semester.
Are you fucking...
He paid her tuition?
Isn't that why you
just asked to see him?
No, I asked to see him
about something...
Did you tell her you weren't
going to pay for college?
Yes, because...
How could you do that?
Because her mother,
who is also her landlord...
Hertzfeld? I was ranting!
I was just talking!
You think I would...
I was pissed off because Lisa was
trying to piss me off, Joanna.
That was her intent!
You obviously scared
the hell out of her!
Hertzfeld wrote a check to Harvard...
Pay for...
ls she here yet?
I'm sure she is.
Can you have someone
bring her back?
Yes.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Thank you.
You know,
my grandmother always
used to say to me...
I don't give a shit, Yentl.
I'll have someone get Lisa.
Thank you.
And ifyou see Hertzfeld...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
HERTZFELD: It's Andy!
Speak of
the devil's chief engineer.
Go. Come on in.
You look great today.
Thank you.
Doesn't she?
She looks fantastic.
Always does.
Get out.
Well, I think I know
why I'm here.
Do you?
Steve...
Did you send
the check yet?
Yes.
So Harvard got a tuition check from
Andy Hertzfeld to pay for Lisa?
I don't think
they look that carefully.
I don't think they'd notice the
check didn't come from you.
Close one.
This was almost
embarrassing for me.
(SIGHS)
I understand how... I'll
wire you the money today.
I understand how you feel.
And I do apologize, I do.
But, let me tell you
my thinking.
I can't even think of an appropriate
analogy to describe what you did.
I knew you guys would fix things.
You always do.
But in the meantime,
if the money wasn't there,
she'd miss
a semester of school.
Yeah.
And she'd have to
tell her friends why.
And she needed things.
She needed socks.
What?
It's cold in Cambridge.
She needed warm socks.
You gave her socks?
Well, I gave her money
for socks.
You don't get to deputize
yourself as her interim.
You don't get to override my decisions.
Do you understand?
You don't get to act
like you're her father.
Somebody had to.
What the fuck did you
just say to me?
I've known her
since she was six.
I also consider...
Chrisann's my friend,
outside of what you and I...
(STAMMERS) Outside of
our relationship.
So you're like
a family advisor.
I'm a family friend.
Then you probably know that
Lisa's been seeing a therapist.
Yeah.
For many years.
Yeah.
Without my knowledge.
That really
wasn't my business.
(CHUCKLES) I'm fascinated by what you
think is and isn't your business.
Lisa's been going to a
therapist, and she likes it.
And would love for you and
Chrisann to go with her.
And the reason
you know that is because
you're the one that
recommended the therapist.
Well, I know a guy.
No, I mean you're the one who
recommended that she see a therapist.
You know what?
It was a while ago, and I don't
remember how the whole...
You told Chrisann that Lisa
should see a therapist.
Steve, you're stigmatizing.
It's a perfectly norm...
(SIGHS)
It's not... My thing was,
how can it hurt?
Let's find out.
Chrisann is my friend.
What was the reason
you gave?
You mean...
What was the reason you gave Chrisann
why Lisa should see a therapist?
I don't remember. We were
talking and I said...
It's pretty much
what I just said,
that it certainly
couldn't hurt.
You didn't say that Lisa needed
a strong male role model?
Idid.
I think it's a miracle
she's not robbing banks
with the Symbionese
Liberation Army.
There is no reason in the
world why she should be nice.
But she is.
So I helped.
Because somebody had to.
I'll wire the money
to you this afternoon.
You threatened me
a long time ago.
Sorry?
A long time ago,
you threatened rne once.
People are attracted
to people with talent.
People without it
find that threatening.
(SNAPS FINGERS)
Maybe you should see a therapist.
Certainly couldn't hurt.
I meant you literally
threatened me.
At Flint,
right before the Mac launch.
I was recompiling. I was trying
to debug the voice demo.
And you said if I couldn't
find a solution,
you'd call me out
in front of the audience.
Did it say "hello"?
Itdid.
No need to thank me.
Why do you want people
to dislike you?
I don't want people
to dislike me.
I'm indifferent to whether
they dislike me.
Since it doesn't matter,
I always have.
Really?
I've always
liked you a lot.
That's too bad.
Knock 'em dead.
Thank you.
What is remarkable, what's
hard to fathom but true
is that for a given
clock rate, a PowerPC chip
is twice as fast
as a Pentium ll chip.
In other words,
a 266 megahertz G3 chip
is twice as fast
as a 266 megahertz Pentium ll.
<i>Or</i>
a 266 G3 is equal to
about 500 megahertz.
Take a look at BYTE magazine's BYTE
Marks, the gold standard for any...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come in.
(DOOR OPENS)
I sent someone into the lobby.
They found her and she...
Where is she?
She said she'd rather
not come back.
VVhy?
That was it.
I'm going out there myself.
You can't.
You can't. It'll be a scene
out of Hard <i>Day's Night.</i>
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
Excuse me?
Hey, Joel.
Andy said it was okay
to come back.
Which one?
Andy Cunningham.
I can't do this forever.
I need one of them
to change their name.
You call
Andy Cunningham "Andrea."
It doesn't matter
what I call them.
I know who I'm talking about
when I'm talking.
I need everyone else to
call them different names.
Give me one second.
Can you go get her
for me, please?
I just talked to
Andy Hertzfeld.
I'm just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with Drano.
But I do want
to talk to Lisa.
Okay, just
stay cool.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hey, Steve.
How are you feeling?
I'm feeling good, Joel.
How about you?
I don't think I could be in your business.
It changes too quickly.
Well, I'd hang on,
'cause yours is about to
start changing
pretty quickly, too.
This is the third time in 14
years I'm writing about you.
What do you think so far?
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Excuse me.
Uh, Avie's looking for you.
He has a new shark.
Want to come backstage
for a second?
JOEL: Sure.
Who's this one?
Alan Turing.
Single-handedly won
World War ll and,
for an encore,
invented the computer.
He won't be part of
the campaign, though.
JOEL: Why not?
STEVE: Because you just had
to ask me who he was.
Can I see new shark?
I like it better than the old shark.
AVIE: Sharks.
Sharks.
How many sharks
did you go through?
A couple.
This is the 39th.
We're on the record.
Thirty-nine sharks.
0K3)'-
You know what's special
about this shark? What?
No, I'm really asking,
because it looks exactly
like the other
38 sharks to me.
STEVE: Let me see it with the cue.
From the profile.
STAGE MANAGER:
This is Cue 92-B.
STEVE: This is a profile here.
And this is what
it looks like from the back.
And one more thing. lt eats Pentium
notebooks as a light snack.
This is the shark.
I really like it.
Nobody gets it right
the first time,
but I should have been shown
this shark 15, 20 fish ago.
You probably were.
Lock it in.
10 minutes.
He killed himself by taking a bite
of a poison apple. Alan Turing.
Yeah. There should be
statues of that man.
His name should be on the
lips of schoolchildren.
The rainbow flag Apple
with a bite taken out.
That's where it came from?
No, we picked it off a list
of friendly-sounding words.
But wouldn't it be great ifthat
had been the story behind it?
WOZNIAKI Steve.
Kinda liked the last shark.
AVIE: Fuck you.
(CHUCKLES)
I wanted to ask you a favor.
My friend, a long time ago,
you asked me a favor before a
product launch, and I said no.
You wanted me to acknowledge...
Hang on.
Ifyou're about to say
you were wrong,
I want to prepare
this journalist.
I was 100% right.
And you were
spectacularly wrong.
But I still owe you a
favor, so name it.
(SIGHS) Steve.
But it can't be about
acknowledging the Apple ll team.
Acknowledge the Apple ll team.
How about in private?
No. No.
ls this a prank?
Because I'm trying to remember
that a 300 megahertz G3 chip...
Just the top guys.
Steve.
Excuse me, okay?
Yep.
One second.
She said she'd rather not.
What do you mean?
She's sitting
with her friends,
and she said she'd
rather not come back.
Okay. Tell her...
Take her aside,
I don't want to
embarrass her
in front of her friends,
but tell her I just scared
the shit out ofAndy,
and this time, nobody's
paying her fucking...
All right.
Don't say that.
But do your thing, where
you sound old and wise
because of the broad, tragic
European canvas of your life.
You know I wasn't born in a
19th century <i>shtetl,</i> right?
Please tell her
it's important.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
There are people
around here, man,
including a member
of the press.
Isee him.
Woz.
Just the top guys, the ones
who are getting laid off.
(C LEARS TH ROAT)
Listen, okay? Last year, Apple
lost one billion dollars.
I don't even know
how that's possible.
You were less than 90 days
from being insolvent.
I had three different accountants
try to explain it to me.
The whole place has
to be streamlined.
Start with two of the accountants.
I started with the...
Joel, could you
come off-stage?
We're going to go backstage.
Leave him right there.
I started with the Apple ll team
because we don't make that anymore.
Just acknowledge
the top guys.
Have a mimosa and relax.
You will not blow me off
right now, Steve!
The top guys...
There are no top guys.
All right?
On the Apple ll team,
there are no top guys.
They're B players.
And B players discourage
the A players.
And I wantA players
at Apple, and not Dell.
They're not B players, and
I'm a betterjudge of that!
Less than 90 days
from insolvency.
In part, because somebody thought
the Newton wasn't a box of garbage.
Joel, could you come off stage please?
Leave him!
I'm talking about...
You guys designed and shipped a little
box of garbage while I was gone.
I'm talking
about the Apple ll!
Which is not just a crucial
part of this company's history,
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing!
For a time.
The least you can do, ifyou're
going to downsize these people...
They're going to live in the
biggest houses ofanyone
on the unemployment line.
...Is to acknowledge them!
Acknowledge them and the
Apple ll during this launch!
This is a new animal.
This whole place
was built by the Apple ll.
You were built
by the Apple ll.
As a matter of fact,
I was destroyed
by the Apple ll
and its open system,
so that hackers and hobbyists could
build ham radios, or something!
And then,
it nearly destroyed Apple
when you spent
all your money on it
and developed a grand total
of no new products.
The Newton.
The little box of garbage.
You guys came up
with the Newton.
You, like,
want people to know that?
This is a product launch,
notaluncheon.
And the last thing I want to
do is connect the iMac to...
To the only successful product
that this company has ever made.
I'm sorry to be blunt, but
that happens to be the truth.
The Lisa was a failure.
The Macintosh was a failure.
Idon%Hke
talking like this,
but I am tired of being Ringo
when I know I was John.
Everybody loves Ringo.
And I'm tired of
being patronized by you!
You think John became John
by winning a raffle, Woz?
You think he tricked somebody,
or hit George Harrison
over the head?
He was John
because he was John.
<i>He was John</i> because <i>he
wrote Ticket to Ride.</i>
And lwrote the Apple ll.
Everybody?
I want to clear the auditorium.
Nobody moves!
You made a beautiful
board which, by the way,
you were willing to
give out for free,
so don't tell me
how you builtApple.
If it weren't for me, you'd be the
easiest "A" at Homestead High School.
These people live and die by your
praise, so here's your chance.
Acknowledge that
something good happened
that you weren't
in the room for.
No.
WOZNIAK: Steve!
Do it.
It's right. It's...
It's right.
Sorry, but no.
Then let me put it
another way.
I don't think there's a man
who's done more
to advance the
democratization that comes
with personal computing
than I have,
but you've never had any respect for me.
Now why is that?
I'd at least consider
the possibility
that it's because you've
never had any for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
What the hell
is going on here?
Nothing.
Thank you for your time.
It's done.
She's coming back.
You came a half-inch from putting
this company out of business.
Now, who do I see
about that?
I'm letting you keep
yourjob.
You get a pass.
You know,
when people used to ask me
what the difference was
between me and Steve Jobs,
I would say Steve
was the big-picture guy
and I liked
a solid workbench.
When people ask me what the
difference is now, I say
Steve's an asshole.
Your products are better
than you are, brother.
That's the idea, "brother."
And knowing that,
that's the difference.
It's not binary.
You can be decent and gifted
at the same time.
JOANNA: He didn't mean it.
Yeah, he did.
He's a temperamental guy.
No, he's not.
It's like, five minutes
before every launch,
everyone goes to a bar,
gets drunk,
and tells me
what they really think.
(CHUCKLES)
She's coming
to your dressing room.
JOANNA: I told you to make
things all rightwith Lisa.
I didn't say you had to settle
every blood feud you have.
STEVE: The last time blood feuds weren't
settled, I lost the cover of Time.
Though, for the life of me,
I still don't know
what the hell Dan Kottke
was mad at me about.
Kottke didn't lose you
the cover of Time.
Of course he did.
Would you like me to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong
when you're certain
you're right?
Dan Kottke told Time magazine
that I was denying...
Do you remember
the cover?
<i>Of Time?</i>
Yes.
Yes.
What was it?
What are you talking about?
What was on the cover?
A computer.
No, it was a sculpture
of a computer.
It was a sculpture.
Time would have had to have
commissioned it months in advance.
You were never in the
conversation for Man of the Year.
Nobody lost you anything.
So, what else
are you sure about?
I don't know how
I could've missed that.
Reality distortion.
No, seriously.
Seriously.
Don't try to win
an argumentwith Lisa.
Just say you were wrong.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come on in, honey!
(DOOR OPENS)
It's not "honey."
John! Get in, get in.
Get out of the hall.
I was taken in the side entrance.
I'll go out the same way.
No one will see me.
How are you, Joanna?
JOANNA: I'm good, John. I'm
just surprised to see you.
Everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to Forbes.
You didn't have
to do that.
SCULLEY: My pleasure.
JOANNA: If you want, I can slip you in
the back once the house lights go out.
SCULLEY: l'mjust here to
say "good luck." Okay.
JOANNA: You just have
a couple of minutes.
Would you try to find...
Yeah.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
You're a good man, John.
So, I brought you a present.
The Newton.
Ifyou don't take it out of the
box, you'll be able to sell it.
Which is more
than I can say.
Everything all right there?
What? No.
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah.
Just something
Joanna pointed out to me.
I missed something
so obvious about...
It doesn't matter.
Look, Wall Street's gonna sit back
and wait to see how you do as CEO,
so don't let any fluctuation bother
you for the first 12 months.
Day traders
are gonna respond.
I don't need to school you.
Is this your way of telling me I
shouldn't have killed the Newton?
The most efficient animal on
the planet is the condor.
The most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans.
(CHUCKLES) Well, you shouldn't
have killed it for spite.
That's bad business.
Don't do that.
But a human with a bicycle becomes
the most efficient animal.
And the right computer...
A friendly, easy computer
that isn't an eyesore,
but rather sits on your desk with
the beauty of a tensor lamp,
the right computer will be
a bicycle for the mind.
Do you like it?
I was given back.
And what if, instead of it
being in the right hands,
it was in everyone's hands?
Everyone in the world.
SCULLEY: We'd be talking about the most
tectonic shift in the status quo since...
Even
I don't know why you've always been
interested in my adoption history,
but you said, it's not like someone
looked at me and gave me back.
But that is what happened.
You're telling me
you have the right computer?
It's called Macintosh.
A lawyer couple
adopted me first,
then gave me back
after a month.
They changed their mind.
Then my parents
adopted me.
My biological mother had
stipulated that whoever took me
had to be college-educated,
wealthy, and Catholic.
Paul and Clara Jobs
were none of those things,
so my biological mother wouldn't
sign the adoption papers.
What happened?
There was a legal battle
that went on for a while.
My mother said she refused to
love me for the first year.
You know, in case
they had to give me back.
You can't refuse to
love someone, Steve.
Yeah, it turns out
you can.
What the hell can
a one-month-old do
that's so bad that his
parents give him back?
There's nothing
a one-month-old can do.
Have you ever thought about trying
to find your biological father?
I've met
my biological father.
For that matter,
so have you.
It's called Macintosh.
Mr. Steve Jobs!
Jandali.
Say hello to John Sculley.
Jandali owns the place,
and John's the CEO of Pepsi,
<i>but I'm trying to get him
to move to Cupertino.</i>
<i>Put</i> a <i>dent in the universe.</i>
You eat vegan as well?
You're kidding me.
No, I'll eat anything.
Why don't you
start us off with
the Mediterranean lettuce
salad with purslane, mint...
My sister found him.
Does he know?
No. In fact,
he bragged to Mona
that Steve Jobs comes in the
restaurant all the time.
You don't want to...
No.
<i>SCULLEY: Don't you think
you should talk to him?</i>
He'd probably find
a reason to sue me.
Oh, Steve...
John, ifyou're here
about your legacy,
you need to form
a line behind Wozniak.
(SIGHS) Wozniak's gonna be fine.
I'm the guy who fired Steve Jobs.
"Rich, college-educated,
and Catholic."
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Steve, it's time.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
I've gotta go.
Did I do this?
Screw it up?
Let's let it go now.
It has to be time.
Come be our CEO.
Yeah, okay.
(LAUGHS)
(SNAPS FINGERS)
It was the stylus, John.
What?
I killed the Newton
because of the stylus.
Ifyou're holding a stylus,
you can't use the other five
that are attached to your wrist.
Things we could have
done together.
God, the things
we could've done.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
I'm paying your tuition.
Are you crazy? Of course
I'm paying your tuition.
I must have misunderstood you when you
said you weren't paying my tuition.
STEVE: You and your mom selling the
house was a hostile thing to do.
She needed the money.
She always needs the money.
She needs a doctor.
She has a sinus infection.
She's had the same
sinus infection since 1988.
I'm gonna take care of my mother.
I'm sorry if that angers you.
It does anger me,
because you're a kid
and it's not yourjob
to take care of your mother.
Is that how yours died?
Guys, um, step away, please.
Give them some room.
When your mom is 90 and can't feed
herself, you can take care of her.
But right now, she's 45, perfectly
healthy, and can't feed herself.
You're supposed to work hard at
school and be 19, and that's it.
I'll take care
of your mother.
Well, keep up
the good work.
What the hell do you want from me?
I was sent for.
Iboughther
a house for $400,000.
It's worth twice
that much today!
She sold it for two magic
rocks and a bowl of soup.
It was her house.
She used that money
to travel through Europe.
Money which you
make her beg for.
Steve... STEVE: Don't
even start with that.
Going to Andy
and asking for the money?
That was so off-the-charts
over the line...
I did not do that.
Andy came to me.
Everybody have an opinion
on this?
I'm sorry, guys. In 30 seconds,
you're going to be late.
She spends
the money on antiques,
and then sells them for
a fraction of what she paid.
And she does it with money
I gave to her for you!
Steve...
You came to me hysterical
when you were 13,
asking ifyou could
live with me...
I was not hysterical.
...because your mom was
screaming at you every day.
And 13 was the second
time I asked you.
The stress of her life
as a spiritual healer.
I don't believe I said you're a bad guy.
But if I did, lam sorry.
Something happened
to you at school.
Some first semester core class that
all freshmen are required to take...
I read Time.
What?
I have Internet access
atschooL
I read an old copy
of Time,
and I asked my mom some questions
about my family history.
That was... Time wrote
a mangled piece ofjournal.
You were never
supposed to read that.
I had two different
Harvard statisticians
try to reverse-engineer
the equation
that you came up with
to prove that 28%
of American men
could be my father!
Honey,LH
You know, my mother might
be a troubled woman,
but what's your excuse?
That's why I'm not impressed
with your story, Dad!
It's that you knew
what I was going through,
and you didn't do
anything about it.
And that makes you
an unconscionable coward.
And not for nothing, but
"think" is a verb, all right?
Making "different"
an adverb.
You're asking people
to think differently,
and you can talk about the
Bauhaus movement and Braun
and "Simplicity is sophistication,"
and lssey Miyake uniforms,
and Bob Dylan lyrics all
you want, but that thing
looks like Judy Jetson's
Easy-Bake oven.

STEVE: Hey!
LISA: Oh, gee,
you're gonna start late.
You know what
"Lisa" stood for?
What?
The computer. The Lisa. Do
you know what it stood for?
I'm sorry I said that about the iMac.
It's not what I really think.
Behind my back, at the office,
you know what it stood for?
Local lnteg rated
System Architecture.
I was five!
Why couldn't you just lie?
Idid.
Of course it was named
after you.
"Local Integrated System Architecture"
doesn't even mean anything.
Why'd you say it wasn't
all those years?
I honestly don't know.
Why'd you say
you aren't my father?
I'm poorly made.
It's after 9:00,
you're gonna be late.
I don't care.
You're writing for the Crimson.
What?
The Apple chapter of the
Harvard Alumni Association
tells me you're writing
for the Crimson.
Oh, yeah,
a little bit. Essays...
I'd like to read one.
Sure.
No, I mean now. I'd like to
read one of your essays now.
Come on,
you've got to go on stage.
The iMac will not be launched until
you give me one of your essays,
so the world
is waiting for you.
JOANNA: I'm really sorry,
guys!
Good luck.
Gonna put music
in your pocket.
What?
100 songs.
1,000 songs. 500 songs.
Somewhere between 500 and 1,000
songs, right in your pocket,
because I can't stand looking at
that inexplicable Walkman anymore.
You're carrying around a brick
playing a cassette tape.
We're not savages.
So I'm gonna put
1,000 songs in your pocket.
You can do that?
Mmm-hmm.
You want to watch
from backstage?

You remember that painting
you did on the original Mac?
I do.
