I know flies in milk.
Specks against white.
I know, I know it.
I know a man by his clothes.
Even I know that much.
I know fair weather from foul.
I know that.
I know the apple by the tree.
That I know.
I know who labours and who loafs.
I know all.
Al I save myself.
I know all things.
I know pink cheeks from wan.
I know death who devours all.
I know everything.
Everything but myself.

...more than a thousand.
Still plagued by high
levels of radioactivity
over 35,000 Fukushima residents
have evacuated.
Many of them haven't been home
since the March 1 1 disaster.
"Boats for Hire"
What's wrong?
I had a weird dream.
Is your mum OK?
As usuaI she felI asleep watching TV.
I want to show you something.
Get him some tea.
Decorate your boat shack
with these...
Lights wilI draw customers in
the evenings.
Thank you, but don't worry.
Going for a run?
- Can I come too?
- Sure.
Off for a run?
Come with us, Mr. Yoruno.
It'lI keep you fit.
Sounds good. Very good!
Off I go.
Don't come back.
You don't mean that!
Sumida, you're the best!
Stop talking!
Go Sumida!
Sumida's out on his evening run.
Should we just accept an overIoad
of information?
I watch Sumida from a distance.
I collect his words.
Do you think I'm a stalker?
That's right, I am.
"All dreams can't come true."
"Not every crab survives in the sea."
"Confidence equals delusion."
"I could buy your soul if I had
enough money."
"Leave me alone and I'll leave you alone.
"I'll rent out boats 'til I die."
"Killing is pompous."
"I wish I was a mole, a 'himizu.'
Fran홹ois Villon
I found just the right poem or you.
I know all things.
I know pink cheeks from wan.
I know death who devours all.
I know all.
All save myself.
The disaster has devastated Japan.
Young people have never known
your own country in turmoiI.
But we'll do our best to
pull ourselves together.
That's what we Japanese do...
Sorry.
Nobody in the world has
experienced atrocities
1ike us Japanese!
Now we Japanese are
rising from the rubble!
Not everybody's rising.
Sumida.
People have to learn not
to look down.
As Sumida's family runs
a boat business
ambition might not play a
big part in his life.
He might be an exception.
But remember,
every single one of you is special.
Each of you is a flower
like no other!
There's no such thing as ordinary.
Sumida, don't give up.
Have a dream!
Repeat after me.
I'm a flower, one of a kind
and I have a dream.
A boat shack's fine.
Ordinary is the best!
Sumida!
Absolutely!
But
you're not ordinary.
"I'm a flower, one of a kind
and I have a dream."
"Don't give up, Sumida!"
"Eloim Essaim, frugativi et appelavi."
"Eloim Essaim, O I implore you."
What is it?
Is a flower really that special?
These one-of-a-kind flowers...
One of them could bloom deep in
the woods and never be seen.
Not every flower is in a vase
to be admired.
Do dreams and effort make
a flower bloom?
Is working for a dream so wonderful?
Tighter!
That's what I'm doing.
Don't fall.
Sumida, welcome home!
What's that?
Take a look, we decorated
your boat shack.
Now no one will forget this place!
It's a "boat cafe" or "boat bar"!
It's so chic that it's sure
to attract clientele.
These two gave me a hand.
I'm Ma-kun, nice to know you.
I'm Kenkichi Fujimoto.
Call me Kenkichi.
Yoruno here told me about you!
Sumida always helps me out.
He's the most dashing young man
in Japan.
I have a dream to become rich again
with Sumida!
What! You think you'll be
company president again?
Sure I will!
You have beer too!
Join us.
Welcome home.
Keita helped out a lot too.
Remember the bulbs I showed you?
Flash-flash!
Help yourselves.
I feel at home here.
It's nice and cozy.
It's heartwarming.
That's true.
You two can live here too.
That's a nice idea...if that's OK?
How about the space out the back...?
No problem.
RealIy!
That's so nice!
Nobody's as generous as Sumida.
Bring me a beer, Honey!
Thanks.
Are you preparing for college?
No. I won't even go to high school.
I'll work here after school.
You'll rent out the boats?
To couples, fishermen and picnickers.
I can earn enough from this
shabby shack.
Renting boats to people
won't make me happy nor unhappy.
That's all I hope for.
I exchange scrap tin for cash.
It's a fun life.
Thanks to Sumida, we have a house
and a bath!
That's right.
Let's toast!
Cheers!
Where's your mum?
Not here.
- Where is she?
- Dunno.
Uh-huh.
You have an attitude!
Get up!
Give me some cash!
What kind of father asks his
son for money?
Don't you have any?
You useless prick!
Sumida...
Are you hurt?
Was that your Dad?
If someone like him died,
I'd just laugh.
It'd be a better world
without him.
He can't be that bad.
We all have families...who'd
grieve if we died.
- Ma-kun has...
- Quiet!
Me and Mum are his only family.
Mum said that in the next quake
she'd kill him and no-one would know.
Sumida, you can't talk like that.
I mean, I lost everything in the
March 1 1 disaster. But I still...
Everything disappears...
everything!
That thing reminds me of that day...
We'll get it out of the water, OK?
Calm down, it'll be okay.
That son-of-a-bitch was here!
I know he was.
He came snooping around...
I can tell.
He'll be back...
tonight.
For sure!
So I'll go out.
I know he'll be a pain
in the ass.
You deal with him, OK?
Did I wake you?
Where's your mum?
Not here.
Things would've been good
if we hadn't had you.
If you weren't around...
I spent so much money on you!
I could've sold this shack...
It's Mum's.
It never was yours.
You moved in and wouldn't leave!
You punk!
You and your attitude!
Who do you think you're talking to!
Don't call me you!
I am your Goddamn father!
Can't you call me Dad?
Call me Dad, come on!
I wish you'd died that day...
On the day you almost drowned.
Why did you have to survive?
Same ol' story, jerk!
What? What story is that?
You've told me a million times about
the insurance you would have got!
Every time you get drunk,
you no-good wino!
Did I say that to you?
You always do.
How do you remember that?
That's right!
Now hurry up and die!
You know what you're supposed to do!
Die!
"A boat shack is fine.
Ordinary is the best!"
Every single one of us
is special.
Each of us is a flower like no other!
There's no such thing as ordinary.
Have a dream!
A boat shack is fine!
Ordinary is the best!
Good morning.
Sumida!
Hi.
Do you remember my name?
Keiko Chazawa.
You got it!
No umbrella?
I know you live by the river.
We can walk together.
Or does adolescence make you shy?
- Chazawa.
- Yes.
You kind of annoyed me yesterday.
"Sumida, don't give up."
"Have a dream!"
"I'm a flower, one of a kind
and I have a dream!"
Not that!
Come on, I just live down
the street from you!
Chazawa.
Could you please stop praising
me in class.
Oh, that!
Hey, wait for me!
You love birds sharing an umbrella!
Let me in!
Thank you!
Nice to meet you.
It's so crowded, my pants are
wet and soggy.
Don't complain, Yoruno.
- I'm his classmate.
- That's enough.
- We're soul mates.
- Really?
Look, 짜 1 00!
Sorry, girly! You can have
the 짜 1 00!
Thanks for your company. Goodbye!
Lend me clothes!
I'm soaking wet, from my
knickers up.
Lend me a T-shirt.
This is a nice place.
Thank you. I've never worn
boxer shorts before.
To be honest, 1've always wanted
to speak to you, Sumida.
Oh, yeah?
This apple's good.
Your ambition is to live
an ordinary life.
You once told the teacher that you
wanted to live quietly like a mole.
My dream is to live with the man
I love, protecting each other.
And I'll die with a smile
on my face.
You're annoying me again!
Go home!
Leave me alone!
Hello, ma'am, I'm Chazawa.
I'm his classmate.
That's nice.
- Are they your parents?
- Chazawa, go home!
"I know flies in milk.
Specks against white.
I know who labours and who loafs.
I know pink cheeks from wan.
I know death who devours all.
I know all save myself".
What was that?
A poem I wrote.
Great stuff, it touched my heart!
You have talent.
I lied. 1t's by a French poet.
Liar.
Let's play the Haiku game.
We say words in 5-7-5 syllables.
I start with a 5-syllable sentence.
I'm ve-ry so-rry.
If you fail to quickly respond with
a 7-syllable sentence
I'll slap you.
If you still can't think of one,
1 will and then I slap you.
What the fuck?
I'm-ve-ry-so-rry!
5 syllables!
I , 2, 3, 4, 5!
Time's up!
Sorry-I-lied-to-you-before, seven!
I , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7!
I'm sorry, five!
Go on!
Stop that...
5-7-5! It's your turn,
5 syllables.
Five...
5, Five...
Stop-it-you-bitch, 5!
It-was-grie-vous-ly-pain-ful.
Stop-it-you-bitch...!
No, we have to take turns!
Sumida!
Come back here, you!
Game's cancelled!
It's not working.
You two, calm down.
Leave!
Go away!
Go!
It really hurts!
Sumida.
What are you doing? Stop!
When I get pissed, I'll take a rock
from here and keep it in my pocket.
Do what you like!
The first grudge I have against you!
Whatever.
When my pocket is full,
I'll hurl them at you!
Do as you like!
What's that racket outside?
Come on, quickly.
All ready?
Ooh, it's cold!
Sumida.
Hello!
We're moving in tomorrow.
We'll be neighbours.
Yoruno.
We brought some beer.
Let's drink it.
Not today.
I'm off to work. Take care of
the business.
I'll give you a ride.
- Why are you here?
- Hey!
If 1 see you again I'll kill you.
I mean it, loser!
Shut up!
Is there a problem?
Ken, don't get involved.
Scum buckets.
Give me a ride?
Are you okay?
Go away!
Hi.
Hi, Mum.
Tell me...
Do you let them use our bath?
What?
You know...
Do you let those people use
our bath when I'm not here?
They might be radioactive.
No way.
We rose from the ashes of WWll and
became the largest aid donor.
After March I I ,
we needed aid again.
After the disaster
I've been thinking about what
1 can do.
I had a vision.
It was your faces.
Wait for us! What's going on?
There it is! Come on!
What's this about?
These are oil barrels.
This looks better.
Help me carry this.
Anything for Sumida!
How is it?
It's Heaven on Earth...
Sumida, l got it.
This is a bath.
You're kind of slow...
Don't say that.
It's nice. You can bathe
watching the stars.
We can bathe every day.
It's fantastic...
"Have a nice life."
We can charge 짜500 per person.
That's greedy.
짜500 is not greedy.
Would we have to pay?
What's wrong?
She's gone.
His mother's gone...
Any problem?
Not at all!
His mother packed up and left.
She split...
with that jerk.
She'll come back.
The tsunami didn't wipe you out.
She has a house to come back to.
She left a note, didn't she?
What does it say?
What will you do?
Nothing.
I always expected this.
Yeah, it's no big deal.
He's right.
I'll have to quit school.
The boat man's son is now the boss!
She'll be back soon.
He's right!
What's the correct character for
Intelligent?
Ability or Brain?
Number I 4, Sumida.
He's absent.
Sumida!
Wait just a minute.
Why didn't he come to school?
His mother left. So he has to
run the boat business.
He's depressed so l want him
to be left alone.
He's depressed so
leave him alone!
Hush, Keita!
That hurt!
Shouldn't you be at school?
You're not ordinary...
Your parents have left you
and you've quit school...
Working all day at the age of I 4
isn't ordinary.
- Really?
- Of course!
I'm sure some kids do.
I could still be considered ordinary.
Sumida!
Don't worry, I'm here for you!
You have nothing to worry about!
It'll be okay...
It'll be okay. 1t'll be okay.
Don't look so grim!
Smile! Smile!
I'm hungry.
Whoops, l'm sorry.
Sorry!
- Sorry.
- Thanks.
Hey, watch where you're going.
Who are you?
Teach me that.
Please.
So your friend's parents
abandoned him?
Those things still happen?
You make me want to cry.
He might not want to accept
stolen money.
I'll pretend it's from his Mum.
How much do you want?
How much?
Like, 짜500.
You're a nice guy.
I'll give you something nice.
Something nice?
Come on in!
Who's he?
Don't let in any old creep.
Nice to meet you.
Kiss my ass.
Loosen up.
Got laid lately?
Done this?
Go on then.
Hey, what the fuck..?
- Come on.
- Let go!
Recycle!
Let me go!
Let me go, asshole!
Don't be polite.
I'm fine!
Let go!
Moron!
See ya, don't come back!
How could you pass?
I'm okay.
Yoruno, picking pockets will never
get you big money.
How about 짜 l 0 million?
I 0 million for you, l 0 million for me.
The money's just waiting for us
to take it.
I know a pusher who's keeping money
from his yakuza boss.
All cash and it's illegal.
I've thought it over.
I've got it all worked out.
It's foolproof.
There'd even be time
to take a shit.
I'm going.
I'm going home now.
Think about it.
You want a boat?
짜600 per hour.
Thank you very much.
You want a boat?
Why aren't you at school?
I'd like to start working here today.
For no wages.
Don't say no.
You know you need help.
Go home.
I said Go home!
I'll tell the teacher
and the police.
You're here with no
parental supervision.
And I'll let the media know your
miserable life story.
Is that OK? Those people won't leave
you alone, Boss.
Mind if I call you that?
This place needs a better name.
Let's think up something
better than Boats for Hire.
I know!
Sumida Boat House!
We'll make a sign!
I'll hand out fliers in town.
They'll have to be cool fliers!
Chazawa...
It just sounds like trouble to me.
I don't want you blaming me
if you fail your exams.
Why not learn a new English word
instead of pitying me?
What the hell?
Don't run away!
You stupid woman!
That hurt!
I'm pissed!
This rock is for my second
grudge against you!
Don't you remember?
This is the first one.
Oh, that!
Keep collecting rocks.
Hey, Sumida!
What are you doing all wet?
She's here again!
Are you dating?
Are you two in love?
Oh, my God, it's late!
I have to go.
Off l go and I'll be back.
Don't come back!
I will!
Take care!
Come again!
Honey!
I'll do anything.
She's a darling.
She can show you heaven.
I don't need heaven!
Hello?
It's time.
It's you.
What are you doing?
Are you hungry, Mother Dear?
I'll fix something.
Yes, Mother is hungry.
Cook dinner right away.
Where's your Father gone?
To that cunt again?
Goddamn him. Cook something quickly.
I'm going to play pachinko.
l might win.
Give it up, you idiot!
You brat...
That's no way to talk to
your Mother.
It was me who gave you life and
the name, Keiko Chazawa.
You broke your piggy bank.
What for?
None of your business.
I have to play pachinko.
Aren't you ashamed to behave
like this?
Like this?
How much debt do you think
that man got us into?
There're people worse off
than you!
You let tiny problems get to you!
Little cunt.
Right! And the little cunt
can see what's going on!
Keiko!
Keiko Dear, I've been putting this
together for you.
I'll tell you when it's done.
Will you die when it's ready?
Like you said you would?
Keiko!
Get it ready.
OK.
Don't run away from me!
Where do you think
you're going?
Let go!
No!
Where are you going?
Keiko!
Open up!
Open the door, Keiko!
There's a customer.
Look at that Jaguar!
Is this the Sumida house?
Are you his son?
Is your father home?
- He isn't here.
- Mother?
They've both left.
You can't hide them.
Mr. Sumida!
I said he's not here!
Are you okay?
Front teeth are expensive
to replace!
This is a pain in the ass...
Your father borrowed money from us.
He owes us 짜6 million.
He wept and said he needed it
for the family.
We want it, even in partial payments.
That's how a loan works!
Find the loser and lecture him!
There's no money here! Go!
Don't come back! Do you hear me?
The loser...huh?
Your father is a genuine loser.
Now...
Promise you'll call me if you
find out where he is.
Fuck off, go find the loser
yourself!
Pick it up.
I can tear you in pieces now.
Kids' organs get a good price!
Pick it up!
Apologise!
Apologise.
I can't be beaten.
I have pride despite my dismal
circumstances.
I was unlucky to be born to
a cunt and a loser!
That doesn't make me a loser!
I'm not a loser like you!
You'll see that nobody can
touch my future!
I won't be like you!
I'll be a respectable adult!
Apologise!
You're lame.
It's just 6 million.
What are you babbling about?
It's only 6 million.
Only 6 million?
You beat up a boy
for such a small amount!
You think it's small change!
Don't!
I'm used to beatings.
You fucker...!
Leave him alone!
Give me 짜6 million worth
of beatings!
You're real tough!
You seem to have a lot invested
in this.
So I'll leave it to you.
I'll come back tomorrow.
Let's go!
Yoruno?
Is that you? I thought you were
a gremlin!
I'm in! Let me in
on your scheme!
Huh? Have you forgotten?
OK, OK. Let's go in.
You surprised me, man.
- What changed your mind?
- Money.
- How much?
- 짜6 million.
Why?
Mind your own business!
If the deal's off, l'll go.
Relax, don't get weird.
What day is it?
Friday.
Shit, I feel fucking high!
Let's go, man.
Where?
To get the money!
You mean, now?
Come on, he'll be back in
an hour or so.
This is not a trip to the 7-Eleven!
Isn't this too casual?
You sure we're OK?
Shouldn't we have masks on?
We're fine so shut up!
Look at this mess, it's beyond me!
You sure there's money in here?
Look at this,
it's all mouldy and disgusting!
I couldn't live like this.
Who could tolerate a pigsty like this?
It's because he's a sloth that
we could get in.
"Valuable, do not open."
That's real!
Did I forget to lock the door...?
And the lights are on too.
...they know about the pitfalls
of nuclear energy
but they didn't stop.
Their excuse was that they'd
come too far.
It's all self-interest.
Shut up, fuck off!
Nuke is the rule!
Many countries moved away from
nuclear power since the disaster.
But notJapan. Why?
Our society isn't guided
by logic and rationality.
She's dead...
She's dead!
There's no God in Japan.
Christians, Muslims, Jews,
all have one God.
He is absolute and
judges His believers.
So believers consciously
surrender to His will.
In Japan, God isn't an
omnipotent being.
We aren't urged to change our ways.
The Japanese put themselves first.
People in other cultures
do that too...
But is it the most important thing?
Life is important.
But there must be
more important things.
The Japanese want to maintain
life as it is, at all costs.
Military leaders knew that they
had no chance in WWII.
Their excuse was that they'd
come too far.
The Fukushima power plant
was out of control.
Clearly the official data
didn't reflect reality.
The Government told us
the radioactivity readings...
Get up, Hitler!
weren't an immediate
threat to our health.
That wasn't the point.
Is he alive?
No, he's not even twitching.
Let's call an ambulance!
He might live.
Don't be stupid! Thieves don't
call ambulances!
What are you saying!
This'll make us murderers!
It wasn't foolproof!
What a mess!
We're in deep shit!
It's robbery and murder!
No way... I'll get an ambulance.
- And 1'll run!
- No, don't you dare!
Stop moaning, you pathetic prick!
You want to die too?
Oh, this is a pain.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
Listen carefully.
I'm going to rent a car.
And then what?
Think, genius! We have to bury
Hitler somewhere.
You still shitting in your pants?
You know this is our secret.
Can you keep a secret?
You're shaking?
Don't go to the police.
You're spooking me...
This is our secret, right?
Your order's ready.

More on the nuclear disaster.
Parents in Fukushima have organised
a group to protect their children
against exposure to
ionising radiation...
Is your mum home?
No, she isn't.
Oh, ouch...
My body hurts recently...
Lookie what you've got here.
Do you have some cash?
Of course 1 don't.
Mum left with some stranger
some time ago.
What the fuck?
You're by yourself then?
I see.
I'll come back.
Listen.
This is a good chance to talk.
I know that you want to die.
It's so obvious.
I don't want to die.
You don't.
I've been wanting to tell you
this for a long time.
If you want to die, go ahead.
I'm really better off without you.
I never wanted you.
I wish you died when you almost
drowned in that river.
If you died I would have...
The insurance!
I would've got it.
You just don't die, do you!
If you want to die, go ahead!
Things will be okay.
Don't worry about me.
Don't worry about your mum.
I'll think about it.
Good!
Oh, it feels good to get that
off my chest!
I feel lighter!
People shouldn't lie, you know.
A parent should act like one
but not at the cost of lies.
I feel free.
Thank you,
it's good to let that out.
I'll come back.
How many more times do you have to
tell me that?
Wasn't that the first time?
I've always wanted to tell you and
finally I could.
1 wanted to say
that l wish you'd died.
I got that burden off my shoulders.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Right.
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Really...
I wish you never existed.
Sorry.
What's the matter?
Wake up!
What's the matter with you?
Wake up! Come on, get up!
Oh, God, why?
Why did you make me do this!
And next up
at 4pm today in a suburb
in Ibaraki
a man stabbed pedestrians.
He was captured 1 hour later.
The man is Haruhiko Kosugi, 49,
an Ibaraki resident
with no steady employment record.
The police say that 5 victims
were hospitalised.
With one 1 9-year-old man
dying later.
Under interrogation Kosugi said
he'd felt encouraged to commit
a crime after meeting a soul mate.
That was his confession.
The case will be investigated
as a random killing spree
as they look into the suspect's
background and motives.
It's May 7, the first day of
the rest of my life.
No police, no suicide...
I guess 1'm stingier
than 1 figured.
Even if my life is worth less than
a speck of dirt
I want to use it...
for the good of society.
I must have been born to do
some good.
I'll kill idiots who
trouble citizens.
Look at that nutcase.
Phew, stinky dick!
You mean me?
What stinks?
What did you say?
- Far-out!
- You think I'm weird?
You just stink.
What are you, l 4?
Let me borrow some cash.
You want money?
Yes.
- You think money talks?
- Right.
Then you deserve to die.
- Watch it!
- Run or die.
You wouldn't have the guts!
What did you do!
You stabbed me!
I'll go for a kill.
You have I 0 seconds to run.
- 1 , 2...
- I'll kill you!
3, 4, 5...
6, 7, 8, 9
Ten!
"Kaneko Loans"
Sumida!
You have the money?
Well, do you?
"Kaneko Loans"
Hey, the son of the boat man.
Lucky bastard.
This boy's pal paid us 6 million
in cash, in one payment!
He's the one you were talking about!
I wish l had a rich pal like yours!
We're done with you.
Now, get out of here.
Maybe you've used up
all your luck with this.
What's this?
Explain.
You mean, you don't know
what your pal did?
He claims to be a president.
He told us he was a rich owner
of a company.
The tsunami wiped it out,
what was the name...?
Anyhow, he paid back your dad's
debt in one payment.
He blew my mind!
He brought the 6 million
in a paper bag!
Why pay off the loan of a boy
you hardly know?
Just take the money.
Tell me your story.
Otherwise I can't accept this.
I don't like receiving favours
from strangers.
It could be dirty money!
Regular folks might fall for it...
Not me.
I don't take charity.
You count on charity and you
end up homeless like you.
I...
Mr. Disaster Victim, look at yourself.
You're a mess.
Tsunami took everything you owned?
Now you have 6 million for
a kid you don't know?
Bullshit!
It sounds fishy to me.
What's your real motive for
doing this for the kid?
- For the future.
- What?
I died once.
I died in the tsunami.
But Sumida...
The kid has a future ahead of him.
He's someone we can invest
our future in!
I hate to tell you this but...
You and 1 could drop dead
any minute. We're the past.
With this money
the future will survive in him!
What's that about?
Take the money!
Shut the hell up and take the money!
You bastard!
Please!
You idiot asshole!
Thank you, sir!
Get away from me, you're morbid!
I...I...
I'll never forget this.
Thank you! Sorry!
I'm leaving.
What are you supposed to be anyway?
A ghoul from hell and beyond?
Maybe l'm your angel, or...
Satan.
It's May 7, the first day of
the rest of my life.
No police, no suicide...
I guess I'm stingier
than I figured.
Even if my life's worth less than
a speck of dirt
I want to use it
for the good of society.
It's May 7, the first day of
the rest of my life.
No police, no suicide...
I guess I'm stingier
than I figured.
Even if my life's worth less than
a speck of dirt
I want to use it
for the good of society.
Hey, Sumida! Yeah!
Welcome!
Sumida! Sumida!
Where have you been?
Sumida!
You left everything unlocked!
It's not safe.
What did you do?
What did you do to make
6 million yen!
Tell me! Tell me!
I don't know!
Sumida!
To hell with it.
It doesn't matter.
Farewell, Shozo Yoruno.
This is goodbye.
I want you to leave.
I'll kill you if you come back!
Sumida...
Thank you...
You shut the fuck up!
Sumida!
Thank you for taking care of
a man like me!
Number 30, Takumi Yamamoto.
Number 3 I , Megumi Yamamoto.
Sumida and Chazawa are absent again.
Maybe they live together!
I helped myself to an ice candy.
Why did you just leave like that?
What's this about police?
The rest of my life?
What have you done?
What will you do for society?
Pick up trash? Donate your organs?
Is this an existential quest
to prove yourself?
I don't know what's going on but
it's strange.
You have to do something!
Or you'll become what you used to
call a loser.
Sumida.
The third rock!
This is the third grudge
I have against you!
When l have a pocket full,
I'll hurl them at you!
I know you loaf around!
You're sneaky!
Just like most Japanese people.
You too! People like you
make Japan rot faster!
Everybody's stupid!
I can kill you because nobody
cares if idiots died.
I'll kill all the idiots.
Are you the one who
hangs up on me?
You're all stupid!
Hope you like our song.
Outside the bus,
it's a warm spring day.
Driving by
the blossoming cherry trees.
Petals fly in
on you sleeping next to me.
They land on your hair,
on your cheek.
We had laughs and tears.
And a future dream.
I tried so hard
not to see it.
Then I heard you,
like water in my face,
It woke me out of a slumber,
Now I won't turn and run
I always knew,
that there was always love
between us.
Yes, the world is beautiful.
Hi, there.
Call the police!
Yes, the world is beautiful.
Yes, it really is
Now's the time to
Start walking
We will not
Wait for daybreak
The moon up above
Watching over me
Only me...
- Who am I?
- What?
Tell me please!
I'll kill you.
What!
I'll kill you!
What are you?
Thank you!
I got him!
Somebody tell me who 1 am!
Who am I?
Somebody, please tell me!
Who am I?
Tell me who 1 am!
Who am I?
I don't know what to do.
Where am I?
What am l supposed to do?
Where am I?
Hey! Who am I?
I have no clue!
You have to tell me!
Where have you been?
Lurking in the dark
like a zombie?
What do you want?
I have some questions to ask.
Sumida, if what I say now
is correct,
say Correct!
I know you hate lies.
Some time prior to May 7...
I think you
killed your father.
In despair you wanted to
kill yourself.
But you decided to do
something with your life.
For society's good.
To be a respectable adult.
Is this too farfetched?
It is.
Oh, God, thank you!
Sumida, you're not a murderer.
It scared me to think about it.
I was even more scared to
ask you if it was true.
Why don't you talk?
Are you lying?
No, I'm not.
You listened to my tape!
You broke in
and listened to it!
The 4th rock.
This is the 4th grudge.
Thank God for the earthquake!
Abandoned cars
were everywhere!
"Fuckers!"
So I looted them for car parts
and sold them!
"Filthy Losers"
I did well!
Nobody saw me!
"Die"
I hit some ATMs.
Can I take your order?
One oolong tea.
Beer!
Beer please!
Serve them.
Sorry.
- You're slow!
- Sorry.
Pizza delivery!
"Cunt"
It's too late!
We don't want it.
I do this by choice.
Leave me alone.
Boat man's son!
Remember me? What's a kid like you
doing out so late?
There're no trains.
I'll give you a ride.
No, I'll walk.
Walk from here?
You won't get home
before sunrise.
Shut up, you loser.
Get in the car, idiot.
Don't reject kindness.
I'll kill you.
That would be a neat end.
Get in!
I know I'm a yakuza so I'll be killed
sooner or later.
It could be now, by you.
Get in the car anyhow!
Let me give you some advice.
Your mind is sick now.
You have more choices than you can
choose from.
But you're so sick you can't see.
So you make bad choices.
Shit, a preaching yakuza.
Go away.
Wait a minute!
Hold on, kid.
You can keep this.
Are you that stupid?
Why would I need that?
Just keep it.
You can toss it into the river.
You want to kill losers.
Even a pro can't do it well
with a knife.
This gets the job done.
I don't want it! Go away!
Okay, okay.
Well well...
OK.
Let's see...
I'll hide it in here.
This is mine, so don't touch it.
One day you'll figure out
why 1 left it here.
That'll be your turning point.
Until then, stick to that
kitchen knife.
Good morning.
Having a day off from
zombie duty?
I know...
I know it all...
1 know flies in milk.
Specks against white.
I know...
I know who labours and who loafs.
I know from the face.
I know.
I know all.
All save myself.
You memorised it.
You were correct.
Like you said.
What do you mean?
You asked me if I'd killed someone.
You asked me if I'd killed
my father.
I killed my father.
I killed him.
I did, 1 certainly did.
I hit him with a cinder block
on the head.
I buried the body.
The rest of my life is a sham.
I haven't told the police
or killed myself.
I make excuses and go on living,
loafing.
You're trying to do
good things for society.
Killing off the bad guys.
I'll find bad guys.
And kill them.
When will your mission end?
After it ends
what do you intend to do?
You didn't plan ahead?
Let's get married.
We should get married.
We're still junior-high kids but
we don't have to wait long.
Sumida.
The game begins!
It's-gone-way-too-far, 5.
- I-have-no-clue-what-so-ever!
- Yes-tota-lly-clue-less.
Go to the police.
Redeem for your crime and then
do what you have to do.
You can do things for people but
you should do yourself a favour.
You're immobilised by your
own rules.
You have to think
about the future.
You have to change your views.
Maybe you failed once.
Then leave your old self behind
and go on.
It's your obligation.
Be strong enough to cry and
ask for help!
That makes me feel like
my arse is exposed.
Should I just go along with
something I don't believe in?
Bullshit!
I won't do that!
Abandon myself to survive,
then what?
Is my objective to live long?
That's nonsense.
Sumida!
Don't kill yourself!
Shit...
Yoruno, wake up! Guys!
We have to rescue Sumida!
He's in danger!
I know it all.
I know flies in milk.
Specks against white.
I know.
I know who labours and who loafs.
I know from the face.
I know.
I know all.
All save myself.
I know it all.
I know flies in milk.
Specks against white.
Yes, I know.
How's your tummy?
I'm OK now, thanks.
Do you want to sit down?
It's OK. 1t's kicking.
Oh, sorry l didn't notice.
Sit here.
Thank you but I'm OK.
Are you sure?
Did you hear that, young man?
A pregnant woman is standing here.
How can you keep sitting
in the courtesy seat?
Where are your manners?
Are you listening to me?
It's OK, the doctor told me
to exercise.
His kind has to be told.
Are you OK? Mother?
Stop the bus!
What's going on?
Courtesy seat, my ass!
I don't have to stand!
Don't I have a choice?
Let me out!
Let go!
Let me go!
Let me kill him!
Let me kill the bastard!
Let go. Why stop me...?
- What's this?
- A sign.
Watch out for the spray.
Watch it!
"Sumida Boat House"
Hey, Sumida!
Sumida, welcome home!
Where have you been?
We were all worried!
Look. This'll make your place popular
in the evenings, make you money!
Sumida, welcome home!
We kind of decided to give it
a makeover.
Don't say No!
We'll leave now so
you two can be alone.
We know you'll be OK.
You two will be just fine.
She painted the interior pink,
like a massage parlour.
What are you talking about?
It's totally cute!
Everyone, we can have
a little party.
Is that okay?
Sumida, come on!
Sumida, from now on,
you're on your own.
Goodbye.
You're your own man.
- Bye.
- You can do it!
Goodbye.
You can go home now.
I'll clean up by myself.
You want to die?
Did you come back so you could
kill yourself?
I won't let you.
I'll keep my eye on you.
If you died...
I'd be so sad
I couldn't go on.
Sumida.
I talked to a police officer
yesterday.
You're a witness...
to murder and improper disposal
of a body.
Let's go to the police tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
I decided by myself.
I went to the police station.
And I told them
that l'd be back with you
tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
I've been waiting for you.
I found your father's body.
Sorry!
Sorry...
But l had to do this.
Don't ever say you'll die!
I'll turn myself in.
Nice, isn't it?
I'm too dumb to decide.
Without guidance l don't know
right from wrong.
I'm always messing up people's lives.
That's not true.
You're just a little sick now.
It's not serious,
you just need to rest.
Talk to the police tomorrow.
Serve your sentence
and become a free man.
And become
a respectable adult.
A well adjusted man.
You'll make it.
You have lots of time.
Plenty of time.
I know that's what you
actually want, Sumida.
That's why you sent me
a distress signal.
Thank you.
Things will turn out OK for me.
I'm sorry.
I made you worry.
We should sleep.
Don't worry.
I'll visit you often.
Write to me a lot, okay?
I'll come pick you up.
By car, if I have my license.
Forget it.
Why?
By then you'll have
a new boyfriend.
What? Of course l won't.
You will.
Some college guy with dimples,
you meet at your part-time job.
It's ridiculous!
It's very natural for that to happen.
How about you?
You'll fall for some juvie boy
and become gay!
That's ridiculous.
No matter what you say,
I'll wait for you for sure.
After all we love each other.
OK, I have a plan!
When you're out
we'll get married.
We'll move into a cheap apartment
and live happily.
We'll do our best and work hard.
I'll get pregnant and
we'll have a baby.
The baby will call us
Mummy and Daddy.
When the child grows up
and something nice
happens to him
he will be grateful to us
for having him.
And he'll mean it.
And you'll be in love with some
college boy and forget all of this.
Just try to imagine.
Sumida.
lt doesn't matter if it's true.
Just imagine it.
It sounds
so perfectly happy.
Oh, no...
I'm making myself cry.
It's great.
Just like a dream.
Sumida!
The grudge rocks!
I said when I had a pocket full
I'd hurl them at you!
Remember?
This is the I st rock!
The 2nd rock!
Sumida!
The 3rd rock!
The 4th rock!
Sumida!
Let's go
to the police.
Sumida, don't give up.
Don't give up.
Sumida!
Sumida.
Sumida, say something.
Don't give up!
Have a dream!
You're a flower, one of a kind.
And you have a dream.
Don't give up!
Sumida!
Don't give up!
Don't give up.
Sumida.
Don't give up.
Don't give up!
Sumida, don't give up!
Sumida!
Don't give up!
Sumida!
Don't give up!
Sumida!
Don't give up!
Sumida!
Sumida, don't give up!
Don't give up!
Sumida!
Don't give up, Sumida!
Sumida, don't give up!
