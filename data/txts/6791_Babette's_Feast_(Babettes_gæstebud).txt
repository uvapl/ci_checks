KAREN BLIXEN'S Babette's Feast
A Film by
GABRIEL AXEL
<i>In this remote corner of Denmark
once lived two sisters,</i>
<i>who were both past
the first flush of youth.</i>
<i>They had been christened
Martine and Filippa,</i>
<i>after Martin Luther and
his friend Philipp Melanchthon.</i>
<i>They spent all their time and almost
all their small income on charity.</i>
Thank you.
<i>Their father had been
a priest and a prophet,</i>
<i>the founder of a religious sect,</i>
<i>who was well-respected,
and perhaps also a little feared.</i>
<i>The pastor had married late
and by now had long been dead.</i>
<i>Every year his disciples
became fewer in number.</i>
<i>But they continued meeting
to read and interpret the Word,</i>
<i>and to honour
the spirit of their master,</i>
<i>whose presence they felt
was among them.</i>
Jerusalem, my heart's true home
Your name is forever dear to me
Your kindness is second to none
You keep us clothed and fed
Never would you give a stone
To the child who begs for bread
<i>The two sisters had a French
servant.</i>
<i>Her name was Babette.</i>
<i>This may seem strange
for two puritan ladies,</i>
<i>living in such a remote,
desolate place,</i>
<i>and it deserves an explanation.</i>
<i>Babette's presence in the house
of the two sisters</i>
<i>can be explained only through
the hidden regions of the heart.</i>
<i>As young girls, the beauty
of Martine and Filippa</i>
<i>had been extraordinary,
akin to flowering fruit trees.</i>
<i>They were never to be seen
at balls or parties.</i>
<i>The young men went to church
in the hope of seeing them.</i>
O Lord, allow thy kingdom
To descend upon us here
So that the spirit of mercy
May wipe out all trace of sin
Then we shall know in our hearts
That God lives here with us
And that thou art dwelling
With those that trust in thee
<i>In the pastor's flock,
earthly love and marriage</i>
<i>were considered to be of scant worth
and merely empty illusion.</i>
In this calling of mine, my two daughters
are my right hand and my left.
Would you rob me of them?
<i>Nevertheless, these two beauties</i>
<i>had upset the peace of heart
and the destinies</i>
<i>of two young gentlemen
from the great world outside.</i>
<i>One was a young officer
by the name of Lorens Löwenhielm.</i>
<i>He had led a merry life
in his garrison town,</i>
<i>and had fallen into debt.</i>
Attention!
Captain, sir! 20 men accounted for!
Lorens! Get a grip on yourself.
You will spend three months
at your aunt's house.
- The old lady?
- Yes.
- At Norre Vossborg?
- Yes.
- In Jutland?
- Yes.
At Norre Vossborg Manor, you'll have
time to think about your conduct,
and to set about improving it.
Welcome to Norre Vossborg.
Come along. I will show you your room.
<i>At this very moment,
he had a mighty vision</i>
<i>of a higher and purer life,</i>
<i>without creditors' letters
or parental lectures,</i>
<i>and with a gentle angel at his side.</i>
<i>With the help of his pious aunt,</i>
<i>he gained admission
to the pastor's house.</i>
Don't just stand there, Martha!
Fetch a cloth!
Mercy and truth are met together,
my dear brothers and sisters.
Righteousness and delight
shall kiss one another.
<i>He repeated his visits,
but it seemed to him</i>
<i>that with each visit he grew
ever more insignificant.</i>
Excuse me.
God's paths run beyond the seas
and the snowy mountain peaks,
where the human eye sees no path.
Amen.
I am going away for ever,
and I shall never,
never see you again.
For I have learned here
that life is hard and cruel,
and that in this world
there are things that are...
..impossible.
<i>When the other young officers
spoke of their love affairs,</i>
<i>he was silent about his.</i>
<i>For reliving it now,
in the officers' mess,</i>
<i>and seeing it
through the eyes of others,</i>
<i>it appeared to him a pitiful affair.</i>
Lorens.
How can a lieutenant of the Hussars
allow himself to be
defeated and frustrated...
By some pious melancholics
who can't even afford
salt for their porridge.
I cannot forget the picture
of that lovely maiden.
You are a dreamer, Lorens.
I would prefer to be like you.
I will forget what happened
on the Jutland coast.
From now on, I shall look forward,
not backward.
I will think of nothing but my career,
and some day...
I shall be an important figure
in the world.
<i>He married a lady-in-waiting
to Queen Sophia.</i>
<i>At that time,
piety was fashionable at the court.</i>
<i>He knew how to apply words
and phrases</i>
<i>that were fixed in his memory
from the parsonage.</i>
We implore God's mercy.
We must carry out
the Lord's tasks with love.
Do you remember that silent young man
who appeared so suddenly,
and vanished just as suddenly?
Yes.
<i>A year later, an even more
distinguished person arrived.</i>
<i>The famous singer from Paris,
Achille Papin,</i>
<i>who had been performing
at the Royal Opera in Stockholm.</i>
Thank you so much, madame.
You are so kind. Thank you, madame.
Stockholm is a delightful town.
Scandinavia has a wealth
of beautiful cities.
I travel a lot,
but what I yearn for most
is to be alone.
I love silence.
Silence and the sound of waves.
Then you should visit the coast of Jutland.
It is magnificent,
and totally unspoilt.
There you could get your fill of fresh air,
and you could rest.
I know a place.
You could stay with the grocer.
<i>But Achille Papin fell into
a kind of melancholy.</i>
<i>He suddenly saw himself
as an old man at the end of his career.</i>
Lord, our God, thy name and glory
Shall be sung throughout the world
Every soul, thy humble subjects,
And every wayfarer shall sing aloud
Thy praises
God is God, though all lands be deserts
God is God, though all life be ended
If the people should vanish
Divine heavens will reign,
and angels play the harp so beautifully
Highest mountain and
deepest vale will vanish
Heaven and earth will perish
Each height and peak will be no longer
But the Lord's glory shall rise again
In a thousand hearts
Almighty God,
thy mercy ascends to the heavens,
and thy righteousness
reaches to the ocean's depths.
She is a diva.
She will soon have Paris at her feet.
Good day, Pastor.
Good day.
I've come to your beautiful country
for reasons of health.
I'm staying at the grocer's.
I'd be very happy to give singing lessons
to the young lady who lives here.
She has a lovely voice and,
with some training,
she will sing like an angel.
It's important when one
sings praise to God.
Are you a Papist?
Yes, Roman Catholic. Papist.
Come in, Monsieur...
Monsieur Achille Papin.
I have spoken to my daughter,
and I give my consent.
I am delighted. Thank you.
Goodbye, Pastor.
Goodbye, Monsieur Papin.
Goodbye, ladies.
Goodbye, monsieur.
See you soon?
Monsieur.
Ah, thank you.
Very good.
You will be like a star in the heavens.
No-one ever sang as well as you will sing.
You will be the only star.
The others will fade away.
The emperor will come to hear you,
and so will the modest seamstress.
You have enough talent
to distract the rich from their wealth
and to comfort the poor in their misery.
Well, Filippa, are you making progress
with Monsieur Papin?
Yes, Father.
A voice within me calls you
It calls you from my heart
Come now, don't fight it
It is the voice of joy
I tremble, yet I listen
I'm fearful of my joy
Desire, love and doubting
Are battling in my heart
Come then with me, my beauty
Masetto loves me still
I'll make you a great lady
My soul weakens already
Come with me, come with me
Come with thy hand in mine, dear
I tremble, yet I listen
Come now, don't fight it
I'm fearful of my joy
Let us leave, my beauty
Come then with me, my beauty
Masetto loves me still
You will be a great lady
My soul weakens already
Oh, come
Let us go
Yes, hand and heart uniting
Each other's love requiting
Love shall unite us
Yes, hand and heart uniting
Each other's love requiting
Love shall unite us
Oh, come
Let us go
Yes, hand and heart uniting
Each other's love requiting
Love shall unite us
Love shall unite us.
Good day, madame!
I do not wish to continue
my singing lessons.
Please, Father,
let Monsieur Papin know my decision.
The Lord's paths also run
across the rivers, my child.
Kindly give this to your guest.
Goodbye, my life
Goodbye, my heart
Goodbye, my hopes.
<i>Achille Papin took the first boat
to Frederikshavn,</i>
<i>and from there back to Paris.</i>
It's that house over there.
<i>Many years later,</i>
<i>one September night in 1 871 ...</i>
Do come inside.
"Dear ladies..."
<i>"Do you remember me?</i>
<i>When l think of you,</i>
<i>l recall the perfume of
wild lilies of the valley.</i>
<i>Could the memory of a Frenchman
who is forever devoted to you</i>
<i>move your hearts to save
the life of a Frenchwoman?</i>
<i>The unfortunate bearer of this letter,
Madame Babette Hersant,</i>
<i>like my beautiful empress herself,</i>
<i>has had to flee from Paris.</i>
<i>Civil war has been raging in our streets.</i>
<i>Madame Hersant's husband
and son were shot.</i>
<i>She herself narrowly escaped the
bloodstained hands of General Galliffet.</i>
<i>She has lost everything
and dares not remain in France.</i>
<i>A nephew of hers works aboard
a ship bound for Frederikshavn.</i>
<i>He has arranged a passage for her.</i>
<i>She asked whether l knew
any generous people in Denmark.</i>
<i>This evoked my memories of you
that l have cherished.</i>
<i>For 35 years, Miss Filippa...</i>
<i>.. l have deplored the fate
that kept your voice</i>
<i>from filling the
Grand Opera House in Paris.</i>
<i>When l think of you now - honoured,
respected, and no doubt surrounded</i>
<i>by a warm
and happy swarm of children -</i>
<i>and when l think of myself -
a lonely, greying old man,</i>
<i>forgotten by those who once
applauded and adored me -</i>
<i>l feel that it is you who
chose the better path in life.</i>
<i>What is fame? The grave awaits us all.</i>
<i>And yet, my beautiful soprano
of the snows,</i>
<i>as l write this
l feel the grave is not the end.</i>
<i>In paradise,
l shall hear your voice again.</i>
<i>There you will forever be
the great artist God intended you to be.</i>
<i>Oh, how you will enchant the angels!</i>
<i>Babette knows how to cook.</i>
<i>Ladies, please accept
the humble homage of a friend</i>
<i>who once was Achille Papin."</i>
Madame,
I am afraid that we cannot employ you.
We do not have sufficient income
to allow us to engage
such an experienced housekeeper.
But I only want to work
for Monsieur Papin's friends.
I will work without wages.
If you won't let me serve you,
I will simply die.
- Stay with us.
- Stay with us.
Let them soak.
You must soak them.
Let them soak.
Cut slices.
Bread.
Let it soak.
A little ale.
- A little ale.
- Ale.
Like this,
through the... sigte.
- Sieve.
- Yes, through the sieve.
- Ale bread.
- Ale bread.
That's right. Then let it boil for one hour.
- Boil for one hour.
- Boil.
- Good morning, Mr Larsen.
- Good morning, Madame Babette.
- Onion.
- Two onions.
Two onions.
- Sugar.
- Sugar.
- 20 skillings.
- 20 skillings?
20.
20 skillings.
- Thank you. Good day, Mr Larsen.
- Goodbye, Madame Babette.
Goodbye.
Here you are.
Thank you, Babette.
Amazing. Since Babette came,
we have more money than before.
<i>Babette had now worked
for the pastor's daughters for 14 years.</i>
- Not fresh.
- Not fresh?
My fish are not fresh?
They were swimming two minutes ago!
- How much?
- 30 skillings.
- 20 skillings.
- 30.
- 30.
- 40 skillings.
30.
All right.
Give us your basket and take them away.
Many thanks!
Can I have those two for 30?
No! That's enough!
These cost 50, and that's that.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Madame Babette.
I'd like a small piece of bacon.
The last one I had was rancid.
I can't understand that.
In the land where I was born
Don't you miss France?
My only link with France is a lottery ticket
that a faithful friend in Paris
renews for me every year.
Not much of a link.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Madame Babette.
She's a clever one.
Yes.
These sins of your youth will be forgiven,
Christopher.
Christ loved us and cleansed us
of our sins with his blood.
Hallelujah.
You who seek Christ,
turn your eyes on the vault of heaven.
There you will see the sign
of his infinite kingdom,
the eternal light.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,
for ever and ever. Amen.
And thank you, Lord,
for sending Babette to us.
She helps our little sisters
so they can devote themselves
to those most wretched
in thy little flock. Amen.
<i>As time passed, the pastor's disciples</i>
<i>became somewhat tetchy
and quarrelsome.</i>
<i>Sometimes small schisms would
erupt among the congregation.</i>
Even though it was a long time ago,
Solveig,
I remember very well
how badly you once treated me.
You remember that I treated you badly?
Well, I remember how jealous you were.
You were anything but nice
to my poor mother.
Now let us all sing
"Thy Kingdom Come, O Lord".
My good Paul, you cheated me that time.
I've always known it.
"Always known it."
You can't even remember what
you had for supper yesterday.
I remember perfectly well.
I always knew you robbed me.
Well, now!
May we have some peace and quiet?
Do you think my dear husband
will forgive me for deceiving him?
Yes.
We were so young.
That's no excuse.
I was married to him. You made me do it.
Yes.
- But you wanted to yourself.
- You tempted me.
Will God forgive me?
Or will my soul be tormented
for what we did?
Of course not. God forgives everything.
Doesn't he, Martine?
My dear sisters and brothers,
you know that December 15th
is the hundredth anniversary
of the birth of our dear father.
Filippa and I have long
looked forward to this day.
We wish to celebrate it
as if our dear father were still with us.
My sister and I are much grieved
over the intolerance and
disagreements among us.
Please remember that peace and
brotherhood should reign here.
I've seen through you, Christopher.
You are a sly one.
Hallelujah!
That is all for today.
It's from France.
Come in.
It's for Madame Babette Hersant.
- Thank you.
- It's from France.
Yes. Thank you.
It's for Babette.
There's a letter for you, Babette.
Thank you.
Dear God!
I've won the lottery!
10,000 francs!
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Babette.
Thank you.
Well, it had to happen.
The Lord gave
and the Lord took away.
- Thank you for helping me.
- You're welcome.
Come in.
I have a wish, ladies.
- Yes, what is it, Babette?
- Please, sit down, Babette.
I would like to prepare
the celebration dinner
for the pastor's birthday - by myself.
But, dear Babette,
we didn't intend giving a dinner party.
My sister and I were thinking
of a modest supper
followed by a cup of coffee.
You know we never offered our guests
anything more than that.
I'd like to prepare a French dinner.
A French dinner?
Just this once, I beg you.
A real French dinner.
A real French dinner.
All right, Babette.
We agree, Babette.
I would like to pay for the dinner
with my own money.
No, Babette. No.
That is out of the question.
- No. We could not accept that.
- No, Babette. We couldn't allow that.
Ladies,
I have never asked you for anything.
Hear my prayer today.
It comes from my heart.
Babette is right.
It's the first time
she's asked us for anything,
and probably also the last.
So be it, Babette.
- We agree, Babette.
- Thank you.
I'll have to ask for a few days off
to give my nephew some instructions
concerning the dinner.
Ah, yes, your nephew.
It was his boat that brought you
from France to Frederikshavn.
- Take some time off.
- Of course, Babette.
Thank you, ladies.
She'll be leaving us soon.
Her heart is already in France.
We mustn't neglect our old people when
we have to manage by ourselves again.
- She’ll be back in a week.
- Yes, but for how long?
Thank you, Johannes.
Welcome back, Babette.
Did you have a good journey?
Very good, thank you.
Did you make your arrangements?
Did you meet your nephew?
Yes. Everything went well.
I gave my nephew a list of the goods
he is to bring me from France.
Careful!
All right.
Martine, I am rather worried about all this.
I am not too happy about
this French dinner either.
There she is.
Praise the Lord!
All the goods arrived safely.
What goods, Babette?
The ingredients for the dinner.
For the French dinner.
Surely that's not wine?
It's Clos de Vougeot 1845.
From Chez Philippe, Rue Montorgueil.
We had no bad intentions.
Filippa and I merely wanted
to grant Babette's wish.
We had no idea where it might lead.
And now... we have exposed ourselves
to dangerous, or maybe even evil, powers.
I cannot even tell you what you
will be served to eat or drink.
What will happen to us?
Lord, grant us thy mercy.
Oh, forgive me.
Don't cry, Martine.
If you only knew how often
I think of my father now.
I feel he's looking down at me and
is seeing his daughters use his home
for a witches' Sabbath!
We shall not say a word
about either food or drink.
Hallelujah.
For the love of our little sisters,
we promise, no matter what happens,
not to say a single word
about the food or the drinks.
Not one comment will pass our lips.
The tongue.
The tongue, this strange little muscle,
has accomplished great
and glorious deeds for man.
But it is also the source of
unleashed evil and deadly poison.
On the day when we solemnly
pay homage to our great master,
we shall use our tongues for prayer
in gratitude for all he meant to us.
The Lord be praised.
Grant us thy salvation.
It will be as if we never
had the sense of taste.
Jerusalem, my heart's true home
Your name is forever dear to me
Your kindness is second to none
You keep us clothed and fed
Never would you give a stone
To the child who begs for bread
- Here is a letter from Mrs Löwenhielm.
- Thank you.
Get yourself some refreshments
in the kitchen.
This is from Mrs Löwenhielm.
She writes that she's had
an unexpected visit
from her nephew,
General Lorens Löwenhielm.
He has spoken of our father
with admiration.
She asks if she may bring him
with her this evening.
We have had a message
from Mrs Löwenhielm.
Her nephew, General Lorens Löwenhielm,
will accompany her.
So we shall be 12 for dinner, not 1 1 .
The general is with
the Royal Swedish Court.
In his youth, he lived in Paris.
A general.
Do not worry.
There will be plenty for everyone.
This is for the turtle soup.
OK.
Hold the tablecloth.
Is there anything you need, Babette?
No. Everything is ready.
The candles.
Vanity...
..of vanities...
All...
..is vanity.
I have achieved everything
you dreamed of,
and satisfied your ambition.
But to what purpose?
Tonight the two of us
shall settle our score.
You must prove to me that
the choice I made was the right one.
God's will be done.
Good evening. Thank you, Filippa.
They're here.
Jerusalem, my heart's true home
Your name is forever dear to me
Your kindness is second to none
You keep us clothed and fed
Never would you give a stone
To the child who begs for bread.
Could many years of victories
after all be seen as a defeat?
Well! Here comes the general.
And our dear old Mrs Löwenhielm.
She is one of the faithful.
Welcome to you both.
It was so good of you to invite us.
Thank you for inviting me.
Thank you for coming such a long way.
Good evening, Mrs Löwenhielm.
Good evening, dear sisters.
Good evening, dear brothers.
Please sit down.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Come inside, where it's warm.
Thanks.
Now we're ready to serve.
Babette says dinner is served.
Let us take our places at the table.
Remember,
we have lost our sense of taste.
Let us pray, using the pastor's own words.
May the bread nourish my body.
May my body do my soul's bidding.
May my soul rise up
to serve God eternally.
Amen.
- Not a word about the food.
- Not a word.
Like at the wedding at Cana,
the food is of no importance.
We won't even think about it.
Amazing!
An amontillado!
And the finest amontillado
I have ever tasted!
This is quite definitely real turtle soup.
And what a turtle soup!
Now, Erik, the champagne.
One glass per person.
And fill the general's glass
whenever it is empty.
It must be some kind of lemonade.
This is good.
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.
But this is a Blinis Demidoff!
And this most certainly is
Veuve Clicquot 1860!
Yes, yes. I'm quite sure we shall
have snow all day tomorrow.
I shall never forget
my first meeting with the pastor,
and the sermon he preached.
I was a depraved
and quarrelsome person.
I have tried to become a good Christian.
Do you remember what he taught us?
"Little children, love one another."
Little children, love one another.
Friends, I can assure you
the pastor's collected sermons
are among the favourite reading
of Her Majesty the Queen.
In the large glasses.
Careful.
This is good.
And this is good.
Remember the time
- indeed, it was almost a miracle -
when our pastor had promised
to give the Christmas sermon
at the church across the fjord?
For two weeks,
the weather had been so bad
that no captain or fisherman
would risk the crossing.
The villagers had given up all hope.
The pastor told them
if no boat would take him
he would walk across to them
on the waves.
And behold, three days before Christmas,
the storm abated.
A cold spell set in and the fjord
froze from shore to shore.
And this had never happened before
in anyone's memory.
One day in Paris,
after I had won a riding competition,
my French fellow officers
invited me out to dine
at one of the finest restaurants,
the Café Anglais.
The chef, surprisingly enough,
was a woman.
<i>We were served cailles en sarcophage,</i>
a dish of her own creation.
General Galliffet,
who was our host for the evening,
explained that this woman,
this head chef,
had the ability to transform a dinner
into a kind of love affair.
A love affair that made no distinction
between bodily appetite
and spiritual appetite.
General Galliffet said that in the past
he had fought a duel for
the love of a beautiful woman.
But now there was no woman in Paris
for whom he would shed his blood -
except for this chef.
She was considered
the greatest culinary genius.
What we are now eating
is nothing less than
<i>cailles en sarcophage.</i>
Hallelujah.
But this really is a caille en sarcophage!
Yes. That it is.
Man shall not merely refrain from,
but also reject any thought of,
food and drink.
Only then can he eat and drink
in the proper spirit.
As our pastor always said:
"Dear brothers and sisters,
all we can take away from this earthly life
is that which we have given away."
Our dear sisters
will be rich in the next life.
Erik!
A good meal, eh, Aunt?
Yes. The gale has died down.
Water in the small glasses.
Here you are, sir.
Look, what beautiful grapes!
"And they came unto the valley of Eshcol,
and cut down a branch
with one cluster of grapes."
"And two of them bore it upon a staff."
"Mercy and truth are met together."
"Righteousness and peace
have kissed each other."
Man,
in his weakness and short-sightedness,
believes he must make choices in this life.
He trembles at the risks he must take.
We know that fear.
But no.
Our choice is of no importance.
There comes a time
when our eyes are opened.
And we come to realise at last
that mercy is infinite.
We need only await it with confidence,
and receive it with gratitude.
Mercy imposes no conditions.
And see! Everything we have chosen
has been granted to us.
And everything
we renounced
has also been granted.
Yes, we even get back
what we threw away.
For mercy and truth are met together.
And righteousness and peace
have kissed each other.
Here you are, sir.
You rascal! You cheated me
with that timber you sold me!
Yes, dear brother.
I cheated you more than you realised.
I knew.
But I played a trick on you
which you never discovered.
Then I deserved it, dearest brother.
Is there more of the Clos de Vougeot,
my lad?
- Can the general have more Clo Jouvo?
- Yes.
Erik, leave the bottle in there.
After the coffee, in the small glasses.
And light the candles in the sitting room.
<i>"Vie... ux... marc... fine... champagne."</i>
- May this meal have pleased you.
- Thank you. Thank you.
God bless you, dear Solveig.
God bless you too, dear Anna.
God bless you, Christopher.
My brother!
Oh, watch the day once again hurry off
And the sun bathe itself in water
The time for us to rest approaches
O God, who dwelleth in heavenly light
Who reigns above in heaven's hall
Be for us our infinite light
in the valley of night
The sand in our hourglass
will soon run out
The day is conquered by the night
The glories of the world are ending
So brief their day
So swift their flight
God, let thy brightness ever shine
Admit us to thy mercy divine
Lorens.
It is time for us to go home.
The general and his aunt
are about to leave.
- Thank you for a nice evening.
- Thanks for your help.
You're welcome.
I have been with you
every day of my life.
Tell me you know that.
Yes, I know it.
You must also know
that I shall be with you every day
that is granted to me
from now on.
Every evening I shall sit down
to dine with you.
Not with my body,
which is of no importance,
but with my soul.
Because this evening I have learned,
my dear,
that in this beautiful world of ours
all things are possible.
Goodbye,
and thank you for a nice evening.
The clock strikes and time goes by
Eternity is nigh
Let us use the time that remains to try
To serve the Lord with heart and mind
So that our true home we shall find
The stars have moved closer.
Perhaps they move closer every night.
Perhaps there will be no snow this year.
Hallelujah.
Oh, that was indeed a very good dinner.
They all thought
it was a very good dinner.
At one time I was the head chef
at the Café Anglais.
We shall all remember this evening
when you are back in Paris.
I'm not going back to Paris.
You're not going back to Paris?
I have nothing to go back to.
They're all dead.
And I have no money.
No money?
But the 10,000 francs?
All spent.
10,000 francs?
Dinner for 12 at the Café Anglais
costs 10,000 francs.
But, dear Babette,
you should not have given
all you owned for us.
It was not just for you.
Now you’ll be poor for the rest of your life
An artist is never poor.
Did you prepare this sort of dinner
at the Café Anglais?
I was able to make them happy.
When I gave of my very best.
Papin knew that.
Achille Papin?
Yes.
He said: "Through the world sounds one
long cry from the heart of the artist:
Give me the chance to do my very best."
But this is not the end, Babette.
I'm certain it is not.
In paradise
you will be the great artist
that God meant you to be.
Ah, how you will delight the angels!
