Hi, I was not sure
out the correct number ...
But now I hear your voice
the message is that it is you

is waiting ...
Expecting a baby, and I also hope
show up as promised
In the old days ... I say we are not old
but if we are an old group
So I hope you come ... after all
A promise is a promise
Thomas Wolf once said
"You can not go home"
What is good for Tom, but it was a girl
he had made a pact with her friends ...
At the age of 12 years to meet when
some of them needed it.
So here I am, driving down
my childhood, somewhere in Indiana
A place you should know not wish to return.
So imagine that a promise
is a promise ...
I chose a bad day to quit.
Hi Doc Coming to Play?
Not today, I'm busy ... oh that's for me.
Good morning, Chrissy Is there anybody home?
One minute!
Now look at your shoulder, baby.
Hi, stop by the store and thought of you.
Thanks!
Do not go near the stove or operated
Very funny
But if this baby is born I will soon have
that out myself.
That would be nice.
"Where is the list?
I have.
What I can not believe it has to
people so excited?
- Long legs, waist and beautiful breasts.
- Roberta I do not like dirty things.
Chrissy's breasts are nothing dirty.
- I can not hear!
- Boobs!
- I can not hear!
- Boobs!
- I can not hear!

Yes, I'm a supermodel
- Glad to see you Teeny
- It's been a long time
Go Girls enter.
- Well, the weather turned.
- It looks exactly like when you moved here.
You know what they say,
Like mother like daughter.
What I offer you a drink?
- Whisky would be nice.
- That I love.
We do not have these liqueurs at home.
Well what is right.
Beer, beer.
- Cool.
- Cool.
- Okay.
- Back in a second.
I was looking for one of these.
- I can not believe that you've retained.
- Morton wanted to throw it away and use the wood.
- If you love.
- But could not afford, well not mine.
It belongs to all.
I am so grateful you came.
Do not worry I think Chrissy will be a
great mother, a little heavy and stiff
But by the grace of God, the boy grow
relatively unharmed.
And if not, it is therapy.
I can not believe they expect a baby Chrissy
I feel so old.
All this puzzled me baby
ie they are educated
And inevitably something goes wrong, one is
Recently, the guilt makes us feel that way.
- This crazy!
- If you have a baby only perpetuates the vicious cycle.
Herod Thanks!
- What are you working now Sam?
- In another.
If you ask me, you should write something
that people can relate
I have not understood any of the things you
writing about aliens.
"I can take that as a compliment?
How about a romance novel as Danielle "
Steve? She really knows how to keep the emotion.
Roberta is true, the longer the
more books are sold.
You know something? I would like to see them more often.
What happened?
10 years ago who did not return.
- Do not complain.
- I'm sorry.
Roberta has chosen to be such ...
Alternative!
Living in sin with her boyfriend but is normal.
If I am normal.
There have been 4 failed marriages ...
Neither has completed a series of monogamous relationships ...
Not wearing black.
- It's happy.
- Technically, I have been married 3 times.
The first was annulled.
See?
You think everything is funny, if I
should ask mature.
Maybe it's true.
Indiana Shelby was not the place
exciting I know ...
In fact the most common cause of death before
of puberty, was boredom.
And in the days before MTV and Nintendo, we
to look as entertain.
The summer of 1970 began like any other summer
school was out ...
And we had 3 months of boredom, but that year was not enough freedom, wanted independence ...
Own place, so we decided to buy
a tree house ...
And the search for making money was the goal of the summer.
The 4 lived in a beautiful new neighborhood ...
Within a planned community and built ...
When everything came back
and the old things went.
- I'm tired of this I do not listen anymore.
- But ...
- But what?
- Calm down please.
I'm tired of talking about these things How many times we'll have this conversation?
Any partner is having trouble Why not
try to fix it?
- We have tried too, is useless.
- Maybe if you spend more time at home.
No! Say What for?
Come here
My parents had been fighting since
I have memory, I never bothered
It was actually the opposite, it was so comfortable
this consistency.
No matter what I do is get bigger.
Breakfast is cold, hurry
Roberta grew up with his father 3 older brothers
his mother died when she was 4 years old
That's his picture, never leaves home without it.
Tina, Tell us, did you feel at the exact moment
they knew you were chosen?
Well I can only say that I've dreamed of this day ...
... I've dreamed of this day since I have memory
Winning an Academy Award at such a young age
is an incredible achievement. Where will you go from here?
Teeny was an only child, his parents liked
meetings with her were never
They were gifted actors and pathological liars.
92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 ...
Chrissy, oh sorry darling "I can go?
Sure!
Oh shut this daughter, the discs become dusty
Oh oh, covered up and down okay?
Chrissy know ... I thought ... what I wonder
"About sex?
If you love, you mentioned and my mom is scared to say boo played! I felt so
Sorry Mom
Okay, okay, I think you're too young
to be informed
But your friends will tell lies
I think I'll give you the facts.
This will be a shock to you but ...
This is a flower ...
all women have a garden
And a garden needs a huge pipeline to water it ...
Or a little while to work ...
As a direct result of that conversation Chrissy spent part of his adult life obsessed with gardening.
These are worms, everyone in the neighborhood
Felt sorry for his mother.
Since we had a goal of summer, let us
life miserable.
They were the enemy
Hi dirty worm.
Now!
Chrissy down
Run, run.
"Roberta, are you okay?
We have a worm, and always get.
As if we were afraid of little girls
Best bear this
Your idea of ??an appointment is sensual: A) A light dinner
candlelight and a walk in the moonlight.
B) lie down on the skin of a bear
a cabin in the mountains.
C) Watch a sexy tape or
D) All of the above.
B
E, none of the above.
Roberta, this is not a possible answer
B then
Definitely A
Surprise, Surprise!
I choose D, the above
Surprise, Surprise!
Are 107 and 24 cents
How much more do we need?
- 23 more and the house will be ours
- Hear the first night we'll have a party.
Oh Sam, your mom!
- What are your short pants
- What are your high boots.
Do not know why, but at the beginning of summer my mom
He began to dress like Nancy Sinatra
Wow your mom is great
Hey girls, today will be the full moon festival
of spirits returning to earth ...
And walk among the living
4 black cows is $ 1.90 children
We are girls
I know
- It's too weird
- What did you expect? It's a witch
I swear it Budu dolls and everything else
Listen to this
One of the dolls looked like the director Winters
And you know something?
Had a needle through his heart ...
I met him a day before the heart attack
- Then do another session tonight?
- It did not work last time and will not this time.
If it worked, this is the night that the barrier
between death and living can be broken
- I read in the encyclopedia of supernatural phenomena.
- You are so strange.
- I come.
- Yeah, me too.
Read the horoscope, Roberta, you're a woman, even your sensuality is hidden ...
You are like a volcano ready to erupt ... Wow Roberta beware.
- It's rubbish.
- Samantha walk the fine line between ...
Romanticism and sex appeal, not fear
to dive, might be surprised.
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Chrissy, making your dreams ...
Before you wilt like a flower.
What am I supposed to understand?
I go on, Teeny are a magnet for sex ...
What attracts men of the 4 points
cardinal, relax.
Back for the rest of my stuff when
girls leave home
- No need to move out
- Please already went through this not work, goodbye.
I decided not to tell my friends about my father
Call me silly but I thought it would.
That was a wish that I had for years
At that time none of our city had divorced
And what I wanted was to be different from my friends.
- Well it's so cold here.
- Take my shirt, I'll have cold, but you shut up.
- It makes me look fat.
- These fat.
I'm not fat ...
Do I look fat?
Take the hand of the person who is at his side
palm to palm.
- Contact Marilyn Monroe.
- Do not cooperated the last time.
No one ever cooperates.
Should contact someone buried
in this cemetery.
What about the dear Johnny?
DEAR JOHNNY MAY 22 1933 - October 1945 JUNE
Find out how he died
Close your eyes, guide to finding the spiritual world that our circle is safe from all evil and harm
Dear Johnny know you were a child when

- Shut up! Concentrate.
Dear Johnny, did we hear? if so give us a sign
Okay just want to talk to you tell us how you died
This here ...
- Says he wants to tell his story.
- Chrissy.
I think we should stop.
Afraid
Tell him not to be afraid, it's all good.
This alone is very lonely, you need a friend.
The fool
- Oh it hurts.
- You deserve it and if you're fat.
Do not do it again.
Sorry ladies but they are so innocent about
these things, ie everything is fake.
Chrissy! Where you going?
Somebody stop it!
- Chrissy, back!
- Chrissy!
Let Sam!
- Sam, let's go from here.
- Look, there's someone else here, Look there!
- Perhaps only the wind better let's go.
- Sam Let's go, let's go!
Roberta, What are you doing? Why can not act
as a child?
Look what you've done.
What?
You know I hate getting dirty
It's nothing
The crazy Pette.
- Let's cut way.
- Let's go.
Base Chrissy, Chrissy basis,
Are you listening?, Change.
What?
We need to meet.
Now?
Remember I saw someone after the meeting?
I think it was in my room.

- Dear Johnny.
Please, this was a bad idea
not a good idea
- Shut up Chrissy! I do not want your complaints now.
- Likewise.
Sam!, Are you okay?
- Oh my God.
- We did indeed make it.
He's back, we call it.
There's nothing about dear Johnny,
documents before 1948 were lost ...
In a fire, but Ms. Wendy Greenfield says the library has a copy of every newspaper in the county.
- That settles it.
- What do you manage?
We can not go by bicycle to Greenfield.
Or do you?
- Truth or Dare, Roberta?
- Truth
What size are your breasts?
Die
Have to say Is not Sam?
There has to say unless you want.
- Can we see them?
- No! They can not see them.
- And yours grow?
- Although I have not really.
The will, and hate.
No, you're lucky Roberta men like
great look at the size of mine.
They almost look real
Fill them with pudding.
"Pudding?
Worms gave me the idea
Gelatin is moving much
The pudding has a better texture
What flavor is it?
Vanilla.
- Chrissy, "Truth or Dare?
- Truth
Have you been given a French kiss?
Are you kidding? I do not get pregnant!
No one gets pregnant by a kiss.
I know, insect brain but everyone knows
that if you kiss and ...
... Automatically think you'll do with it, can not help it, they are driven, is his curse
"And what kind of relationship do you mean?
You know ... put the seed and watering the flower
What? Does not work that way?, Man carries
your hose and spray the flowers.
- I think it's time to rest.
- But we must come before lunch.
- We continued Chrissy.
- Well, go away, leave me here.
- Chrissy!
- I do not care I want to rest
Wait, listen, shut it.
It's beautiful
Wow.

- You do, I will rise again.
- No, the opposite!
Take off!
Please Roberta.
Go! It's good to know my friends.
- Do you know? I thought it
- I, too, Roberta.
If clear Chrissy is the only one who cares about that ...
Chrissy!
- Never again will you make us something to happen, never!
- It was a joke
It was the first time that Roberta faked his death,
Earlier that year, we scared to jump off the roof ...
And pretend that he had broken his neck, had no
experienced a loss like Roberta ...
And we did not understand his jokes, but I wanted to
death seem funny ...
Perhaps to make it easier for her.
What was that?
Sorry, if it means anything to you really
thank you for trying to save.
- But it scared me.
- Sorry
Roberta, you're my best friend
If you have strength Chriss, Curse.
Roberta, do not curse.
Hey, check this out!
- Oh my God!
- What?
- I saw his penis.
- Who?
- And his balls.
- Who?
Scott.
Oh my God!
Of course, now I'm the one who has not seen Scott's team
which as will be the talk of the summer
- I was forced to watch.
- Chrissy nobody is forcing anything.
I have to look at but let me be very clear
I see under protest.
If course!
It is not very large.
- What are you laughing?
- Do you know? is not large, only when you have an erection.
- When that happens it is of this size.
- What is erection?
Your mother has not told you anything?
Beginning to believe my mom is ill-informed.
Hey girls.

Friends get ready to run.
- If you will be better than you get ahead
- Do not send me an insect brain
No, I mean better go
This is too easy

Maybe not so stupid.
That was the day that Roberta

I did not know you'd bring the whole neighborhood.

Go ahead, I have a jar filled
lemonade for you.
Have a seat.

The sheriff's department believes the thief was
caught red-handed and killed the two witnesses ...
When awakened from their sleep, no clues of the suspect, the sheriff believes the thief ...
Passerby and already left the area.
This is a letter my grandfather sent to the newspaper.
What seems to be not enough ... This is the teaching of the deaths of Jonathan Simmons ...
And Beverly Simmons; If they thought that Shelby was a safe area safe from the violence of the outside world ...
We only deceive ourselves.
But Shelby is a safe city, if anything
Imagine going on here like this out there.
Roberta, fine.
No, it is not, not right! Why did they die? Why did she die?
My father lied to me, told me a beautiful angel
Had fallen to the ground and had taken ...
A second before the pain.
Why she had to die? Why did I lie?
It was everything I had.
It is not all you have left.
Only I have you.
- I know how you feel.
- What are you talking?
- My father moved, got divorced.
- A divorce?
Sorry Sam.
Hell, you have us.
Let's make a pact here and now, always
help, no matter what happens in life ...
Although Teeny go to Hollywood and marrying a rich, remember this day and this pact ...
When you need a friend, we tell each other, provided no matter what.
It is a covenant.
- All for one.
- And one for all.
Now more than ever we need to

22 MAY 1933 - JUNE October 1945.
- Is the murderer!
- Please do not hurt us!
Hey, this is not a game room,
is a cemetery.
And you have no respect for the dead.
- We have great respect for the dead.
- Why we're here.
- We did that Johnny wanted to leave the tomb.
- Really?
How do you think the grave is broke in half?
I left with my tractor.
- Yes?
- If it is not easy to move around the tombs.
Not to do these sessions
are a waste of time.
I can not believe you even think about them.
- What about the tarot cards?
- Forget it.
At that moment I realized that our days
of innocence was over ...
Growing up it becomes difficult to believe ...
Not that I want, but spend many
things that is difficult.
Walk.
Pette Look ... it's crazy.
Let him alone, OK?
- What happens?
- What is missing in the cemetery, reached later.
- Do you want to go with you?
- No, I'll be fine.
"Pette?
REST IN PEACE DEAR JOHNNY.
"Are you Petter Simmons?
They were my family.
It's terrible what happened to them,
I'm sorry.
For a long time I thought I could stop him,
I should be home and not at the bar.
You were there for me.
I lost many years, afraid to face the
people and afraid to face myself.
I have also scared.
- What is your name?
- Samantha.
Well ... Samantha, things happen
your life that you can not help ...
But that is no reason to close the world
there is a purpose for good and bad.
I gave the only gift he could offer, the lesson
I had taken a lifetime to learn ...
And although I learned the importance of those words, is so far looking back I understand its meaning.
Rest in peace dear Johnny.
Stops and paint you.
- Do I look better with this?
- Yeah, right.
Thanks.
All strive to still fit,
As we wanted to see us, do the same things ...
Almost be the same people, and without realizing ... that change, the tree house was supposed ...
That should give us more independence, but that summer actually brought was independence between us.
Samantha!
Samantha!
Samantha!
Samantha!

Not really, but I think it's normal
things have gone well.
Look, take a 10 in my career, it's just me
lost in the kinds of relationships.
You could add some color into your wardrobe Samantha, men love the pastel.
This is not the colors or
men ... this is me.
What are you talking about Sam?
How many relationships I've had in many years? And I
all fled, and avoid reaching the next level.
- The level of privacy.
- Well, if you fall you do not suffer.
But that will always be alone.
That's right.
- Hey, Do you remember the summer with Petter crazy?
- We liked mysteries.
- Go to have fun this year.
- Yes, it was the best.
Petter used to send a gift every Christmas with a
some money but I returned it last year.
Yes, he died.
I never told you this, but was Pette
dear father of Johnny.
- What?
- Was he?
How did you know?
Remember the last meeting in the cemetery? Pette turned and put flowers on the grave of dear Johnny ...
And then said something that
meant so much as now.
He said that there are things in life that can not be avoided, but were not reasons to avoid the world.
I realized that was so
fear of the bad things ...
I had lost all good.
You know? I never wanted ...
But I'm glad I did ...
I had forgotten how much I helped take them
you as friends.
We are lucky to have this place and we ...
There is a part of me which you like
stay here forever.
I would not go that far.
- But it would be great to see us more often.
- I agree.
Let's make a pact.
- All for one.
- And one for all.
Vamos!
You can not escape the disappointments
to try to forget ...
But it is only when he embraces the past
that really is progress ...
Tomas Wolf may never return home again ...
But I found my way to the ...
and I'm glad I did.
