Ready?
Yes
Can I begin?
Well.
My name is Fanny Fink
"Harmony Institute"
Matrimonial Advisers
I think that...
I don't think a woman needs a man
to be happy.
But I I'm turning 30 this year
and you know that stupid saying:
A woman over 30 is more likely to get
hit by an A-bomb than find a man.
I live by myself.
For... almost 4 years now.
It's nice.
I like living alone.
It's not like I chose to.
I had 2 long relationships.
After the last one
I had an AIDS test in '91.
Negative.
After that
I never met anybody.
Men were suddenly all married or gay.
And I have no desire
to invest so much only to be...
The time, the energy. Coffee.
It always starts with a cup of coffee.
You go out and eat, talk,
you go to bed. And then it all starts.
You're back smoking,
buying new lingerie.
You sign up in a fitness studio,
keep beer in the fridge.
even trade your cat for a turtle
'cause he's allergic.
And then...
He's afraid of getting too close.
Not too exciting, huh?
I wouldn't fall in love with me
if I were you.
NOBODY LOVES ME
What about Tuesday?
I can't.
Wednesday wouldn't be bad.
Thank you.
It's the day I have dinner
with my mother.
The back.
And today?
I have a course.
What is it this time?
Tantra or recipes for singles?
I really can't.
Why offer to look after Lisa
if you never have time?
Hooks in front.
Magic cross. Separates
Separate ... and lifts.
Why is it you sigles never have time?
What do you do?
Fake orgasms masturbating.
Right, Fanny?
He doesn't have to be good-looking,
or tall, or young.
Not a smoker or a drinker.
With good health insurance.
Is that asking too much?
And an apartment of his own.
I couldn't stand someone else's junk.
We're stuck.
Orfeo de Altamar
Psychic and palm reader.
I'm strong.
I'm strong.
I'm pretty.
I'm pretty.
I'm smart.
I'm smart.
I love and I'm loved.
I love and I'm loved.
Lothar Sticker's the name.
Sticker.
Lothar Sticker
That's very nice of you.
Pets aren't allowed here.
He's harmless.
What kind of neighbors
would you not like to have?
Drunks, musicians, Turks, Blacks
children. And no Italians.
Go on!
Mom!
Go on!
"She's incapable of giving her protagonists
any depth. That must account for her success.
"Medusa's Lover" is suitable for
the beauty parlor,
to read at the dentist's or the toilet"
Gerd Gottler.
What have I ever done to that critic?
What?
What have I done to them?
What have I done to Gerd Gottler?
I don't know.
For Marlene Tisch and her dull prose
they fall to their knees.
Thay think her crap is great.
Because it's so boring.
They can phantasize and jerk off.
Ready to order?
Yes. Two steaks.
Mom, 5 years I'm vegetarian...
That's why you're so dull.
So 2 steaks. Mine extra rare.
And a double whiskey.
A water and no steak.
So, Gerd Gottler... Go to hell!
What are you staring at?
Are you an aspiring critic?
Keep both hands on the table
while writing reviews, okay?
Do you understand?
Both hands on the table?
I've read "Medusa's Lover".
Oh, really?
Yes, and... I loved it.
I thought it was phenomenal.
Re-no-vate.
The entire building.
You mean the rent's going up.
"Psychic and Palm Reader".
Interesting.
And you're 5 month behind
with your rent, right?
The new superintendant?
No, my dear, the new bulding manager.
Thank you very much.
know that the old superintendant
jumped off the roof?
No, I didn't.
Good day.
I'm the new building manager.
Can I offer you a rose?
Shit. All shit.
Go away!
Don't worry! I Won't hurt you.
Just wanted to introduce myself.
Tell me. Honestly.
Did you think my protagonists
lacked depth?
Death sets in after...uh...7 minutes.
Carbon monoxide poisoning
but you're sedated by the pills.
The plastic bag protects you
from well-meaning rescuers.
Make sure your environment is the way
you want it before you put the bag on
Think about music. It makee the crossing
into our new existence so much easier.
Death isn't an end.
It's the beginning.
The beginning of something totally new.
We're going to make friends with death.
We're going to learn how to die.
Great. Nice work.
Good idea, the plexiglass.
I am strong.
I am strong.
I am pretty.
I am pretty.
I am smart.
I am smart.
I love and I'm loved.
Hi, we met in the elevator
the other day.
I was expecting you.
I get this feeling...
My life is running out like a record.
Groove for groove.
And I'm watching.
Only I don't know where the needle is.
Near the end?
Or in the middle?
Or at the very end?
Know what I mean?
I don't make predictions about death.
That's not what I wanted.
What I'd really...
like to know is just,
will I ever say to anybody:
'Isn't it a beautiful day'.
Or 'Don't forget the key'.
Or will anybody ever say to me:
'Fanny Fink...
'you were just what was missing
in my life.'
Early thirties, tall, blonde.
He has long hair, blue eyes.
Expensive suit. Soon...
Your paths will cross very soon.
And I see a car.
His car.
Nice car, black car.
And a number. Very clearly.
It's...
...23.
23 is the number that binds you.
But... you have to start,
take the initiative.
I can't.
I'm much too shy.
"I can't" means "I don't want to".
How old are you?
...26.
Come on. Don't bullshit me.
He's your last chance.
That's 150 marks
and 80 night surcharge, makes 230.
2-3-0. See, there it is again,23.
Your number.
Left pocket, under your keys.
Billie Holiday
Lover Man (oh, Where Can You Be?)
I Don't Know Why
But I'm Feeling So Sad
I Long To Try Something I Never Had
Never Had No Kissin'
Oh, What I've Been Missin'
Lover Man, Oh, Where Can You Be?
The Night Is Cold And I'm So All Alone
I'd Give My Soul
Just To Call You My Own
Got A Moon Above Me
But No One To Love Me
Lover Man, Oh, Where Can You Be?
I've Heard It Said
That The Thrill Of Romance
Can Be Like A Heavenly Dream
I Go To Bed
With A Prayer That You'll Make Love To Me
Strange As It Seems
Someday We'll Meet
And You'll Dry All My Tears
Then Whisper Sweet
Little Things In My Ears
Hugging And A Kissing
Oh, What We've Been Missin'
Lover Man, Oh, Where Can You Be?
I've Heard It Said
That The Thrill Of Romance
Can Be Like A Heavenly Dream
I Go To Bed
With A Prayer That You'll Make Love To Me
Strange As It Seems
Someday We'll Meet
And You'll Dry All My Tears
Then Whisper Sweet
Little Things In My Ears
Hugging And A Kissing
Oh, What We've Been Missin'
Lover Man~~
Where Can You Be~~~?
-You were wonderful.
-Thank you.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- Benno, can I ask a favor of you?
- Anything you want.
I need money.
They want to evict me.
Never hit on me again.
I hate talking about money. Understand?
Come on.
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
Stop it!
Quiet, you bastards!
They can't have turned off the water.
They always warn you first.
They give you...
a note on the door that says:
"the water's off from 9 to 12..."
Morning. I'm Lothar Sticker,
the new super... building manager.
That is Apt. 819.
I hate sleeping alone too.
Really. I'm scared of ghosts.
I have a squirrel with a big bushy tail.
I rub on my nose till I fall asleep.
But keep it to yorself, okey?.
So, I'm Lothar Sticker.
The new building manager.
- You already said that.
- Oh, yea?...
Take it, please.
Go on back to sleep.
I love my car.
It's more than a car!
It's the only place I feel at home.
My car is my home,
it's where I meditate, relax.
And you wrecked it.
I'm really sorry.
Breathe on me.
I couldn't brush my teeth,
the water was turned off.
Yes, the building's being renovated.
Breathe on me.
Let me smell your breath!
...You're not even drunk.
Fill this out.
Couldn't you do it for me?
I never had an accident before.
Oh, God!
Something to drink?
Coffee, black.
With a straw if possible.
Goes to the brain faster...
Better than cocaine. and cheaper.
A cup of coffee.
I don't have any water.
Sticker.
Turn the water on for 5 minutes.
Yes, water! For 5 minutes.
- Your plates number?
- KM... KMP 55.
Comfortable.
What's this doing here?
I'm taking a course on conscious dying.
And you build coffins?
Everybody gets buried at the end.
As an experience.
They teach suicide too?
- Yes.
- So what's the best way?
Sleeping pills and a plastic bag.
You ever think about killing yourself?
Yes. I think about death often.
Most people don't understand.
I don't understand... how you can't.
When you can't sleep at night
and hear your heart beat,
...this funny little muscle...
that everything depends on.
Each beat can be the last.
Sometimes the thought of rotting flesh...
...drives me crazy.
- So I don't eat meat. It's poison.
- Yes, you're right.
I imagine that I've died...
and I'm led into this room crowded
with all the animals I've ever eaten.
Pigs. Cows. Chickens. They're all there
staring at me reproachfully.
I don't eat anything with eyes.
Can you cook?
- Okay... not particularly.
- Than you're not loved enough.
A woman who's loved cooks good...
...and is easier to love.
We could go eat something.
Yes. I'd love to.
- Good morning.
- Hello.
Who's that?
My friend, Charlotte Romer. This is
Lothar Sticker, our new building manager.
I just wrecked his car.
And then lured him up here?
And you came to save me?
Fanny eats men for breakfast.
Sounds really exciting.
It is.
But she hates meat.
Not that kind of meat.
TELL YOUR FORTUNE! PALM READINGS.
10 marks
Need money to go back to AFRICA
I'll pay for that.
- Enjoying your work?
- And how.
I thought so. Well, have fun.
I just felt our newsman's balls.
Packed real tight.
Fanny, Fanny...
You know it's more likely for a woman
over 30 to be hit by an A-bomb...
Say it and you're a dead man.
- Is that yours?
- Yes.
- Would you please open it?
- No.
Than you go back.
I swear I don't have anything that...
- Sorry.
- Please...
It's not your day, Fanny.
The devil writers red letters, yes,
so we'll vanish.
But they'll save me.
With the beating...
of drums and a devastating storm.
Shit. All shit.
What's with him?
Is he dead?
Mr. de Altamar! Hallo!
Hallo!
Do you hear me?
We need an ambulance.
I'll go call one.
Veuve Cliquot...
What? I can't hear you.
Moet Chandon, Heidsieck, Taittinger...
Any champagne at all.
For my circulation... Please.
Here it is.
What is this shit?
Here I am! Come to me!
Quiet, damn it!
They're all crazy
I promised my old man
I'd get them out in 3 months and I will.
Quiet!
I'm just a little stressed out.
Who can concentrate with that noise?
Be patient with me.
Come on...
I get scared alone in the dark.
Come on...
I need water.
My flowers are dying.
- Water...
- Shit...
- Good morning.
- Meow.
- Can you read?
- Yes.
Then read your contract.
No pets allowed.
What are you doing? You can't take
my cats away! My cats!
Come on. That tyrant Sticker will have you
put in the pound.
Hi...
Mr. Sticker?
What's the matter?
Mr Sitcker, can I help you?
- Did someone die?
- No.
It'll be alright.
For sure.
The worst things happen...
And yet...
My last boyfriend, a doctor,
we were together 3 yers...
I thought he loved me
then one day I come home from work
...and all his things are gone.
Like a dream. The whole place was empty.
And I wanted to... jump off the balcony.
9th floor...
...we can't fail.
But see, I'm still here.
Life can be wonderful.
If you want it ti be.
We could be dead in 2 days.
Or tomorrow.
I have an allergy.
I'm allergic to cats...
Oh, God...
You come on like gangbusters.
What's this?
I wanted to lend you my car
while yours is repaired.
So you can meditate.
I'm really stupid. Really an idiot.
It's so embarrassing.
That's a shame.
How could I ever think that...
I'm much too dull.
And too old.
Well...
I think for 400 or 500 marks...
...I could help.
Tighten your ass...
Stomach in. Chest out.
And now left, left and right... Look a little snotty.
We're getting there. Much better.
- When do we get some water?
- Yea, yea, yea...
Listen... You wear his clothes
and he's yours forever.
You cut off his hair
and he belongs to you alone.
Before that candle's burned down,
he'll come.
And take these here.
If you have any at all
they're pre-reunification.
- What do you care?
- Who says I do?
Maybe I just like you.
Now concentrate and start before
they turn to dust.
Come to me...
- Come to me... Come to me...
- And stop grinning.
The scissors cost 28 marks.
Take it out of my purse. Concentrate
and you'll konw where it is.
Come to me... Come to me...
Come to me... Come to me...
- But it's 2 months rent.
- Mr. Rattinger, you owe 5.
- I can't make that.
- Where there's a will... We wait until tommorow.
You can't do that.
I don't have a chance out there.
You know that.
That's your problem, not mine.
- I should've known you were an asshole..
- Well...
How do you do it?
Practice, my dear Walter.
I may call you Walter?
Walter Rattinger, born in East Berlin.
profession: cook.
Stop that humbag!
You don't have long to live.
I read it in your hand.
Your death will be sudden and soon.
Have a nice day.
Come to me... Come to me...
Lale Anderson -
Ein Schiff Wird Kommen (A boat will come)
I am a girl of Piraeus
and the harbor master, boats and the sea.
I love the laughter of the sailors,
I love every kiss flavored with salt and sea.
With all the girls of Piraeus,
walk every night by the pier.
Waiting for arriving ships
Hong Kong Java,
Chile and Shanghai.
A boat will come,
And I will bring the man ...,
I love to like anyone,
and I will be happy.
A boat will come,
and fulfill my dream ...
... and quieter my desire, my wish
many nights.
Ah ... Now you're here.
And I have you in my arms.
Give me another puff on your cigarette.
Watch for this window
The port with its colored lights.
The bar where the music sounds ...
I was sitting here every
Night recent months
Or sailors dancing with strangers.
Thinking always the same thing ...
A boat will come,
And I will bring the man ...,
... I love as to anyone
and I will be happy.
A boat will come,
To fulfill my dream.
To soothe my desire,
I wish it every night.
Come to me ...
...Come to me ...
There is probably no period in history
with less coitus than we have now.
Despite all the sex in the media.
Is that empirical? Entirely empirical.
And I don't like saying it. It all depends.
I do quite well for my age.
I'm coming.
- Mom?
- Reich-Ranitzky murdered me.
He called my book
a pseudo-pornographic manual.
Ideal for masturbate.
Tell me the truth! Am I the reason
your life's so incomplete?
No, mother, you're not.
What are you waiting for?
Are you waiting till your tits
reach your knees?
And your legs look like maps?
Waiting for what?
You konw what I mean.
- Have any fruit?
- Yes.
Is your biological clock digital?
- Don't you hear it ticking?
- No.
Fanny, dear,
I don't want you
to miss anything.
It's all over so fast...
You don't know what getting old is.
Having to watch your skin
get uglier. Like an old sausage,
that's been in the sun too long.
And at night you hear
the time tick away...
The only thing that consoles you
is young male flesh
with no idea what death is.
- Don't get so mad. Why are you leaving?
- Look sweetheart, we're strangers.
The only reason I'm here is sex.
If it's not happening, I'm gone.
Please stay.
I'm afraid of ghosts.
I'll call you.
Bullshit. I'm not calling you.
My God, Fanny,
that's gruesome.
It's padded and very comfotable.
They start with the jackhammers at 6.
I don't understand you, Fanny.
Don't you enjoy life?
Always this thing with death.
Don't you want to live life?
What did I do wrong?
Stavros, this is my mother.
Mom? This is Joachim.
I love him.
This is Lothar.
I love him more than you.
Fanny is a bad person.
Oh, excuse me... I was a...
Really?
- Oh, no, not what you think.
- I hope it is what I think..
- I'm Fanny's mother.
- "Medusa's Lover"?
- You've read it?
- Twice.
I like you.
I do feel a little funny about this.
Nothing personal,
but I'd rather you used these.
- Thanks, I have my own.
- Fine.
Be nice to her, she's so sensitive.
- Shall I escort you to the exit doors?
- No.
Good evening.
So many doors here...
And when they come
they have to know who to rescue...
But a lot of work.
Orfeo!
I'll tell you right off
I'm afraid of disappointing you.
Sexually speaking
I'm a dope.
I need a lot of time,
My brain sabotages me.
It thinks of the caziest things.
The expiration date of yogurt
in the fridge,
or it figures out... how much of my taxes
I'm getting back,
or it tries to convince me...
that my feet stink.
I have to watch out...
that I'm not self-conscious.
And 'cause I watch out...
it's so hard for me to reach orgasm.
I need time and patience, okay?
Noises or sounds distrct me...
even music.
That doesn't mean I don't want to.
The exact opposite.
It's just that I can't always do
what I want.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I knew it wasn't my fault.
You've given me back
my self-confidence.
You.
Of all people.
Let's go to sleep.
Sorry.
No harm done.
- Do I know you?
- Sure you do.
You live here?
- Hi.
- Who are you?
Lesse Langsfeld.
And what are you doing here?
- It's my apartment. Who are you?
- Me?
I'm one of the movers.
Ah. Good job. Thanks.
Sure.
- Where are the coffins?
- They're on the next flight.
Thank you.
But not on Transylvania?
Strange.
- What for breakfast?
- Blood type AB.
No nails with you?
I know. Sombody got in her pants.
Cut the crap.
There's more between heaven and earth than sex.
What?
- Fanny, everything okay?
- Yes.
Why?
I don't know.
What about picking up the kids?
I can't.
Not today. I have plans.
- And I don't have a car.
- Where is your car?
I lent it to a friend.
- What friend?
- Nobody you know.
Okey, I'll pay the taxi.
Charly, I have plans.
You're single with time and I'm stuck.
Why are all my friends such egoists?
Not today.
Orfeo? Orfeo!
It worked. He came.
oh, Orfeo!
I'm so happy I could scream.
Thanks.
I'm going to do something crazy.
His hair.
- His suit.
- Fanny...
I'm going to surprise him.
Orfeo...
I feel...
I feel so brave.
I'm pretty. I'm strong. I'm smart.
I love and I'm loved.
- No!
- Yes!
Fanny!
Fanny, Wait!
Fanny! Come here!
Fanny!
How is life?
I want my bed.
I want to be alone.
I was fine without you.
Without you I'd be alone
in bed reading a book, having a tea.
Without you...
I wouldn't have fallen in love.
I want to go.
I want to be alone!
Orfeo!
Orfeo!
What's the matter?
Orfeo!
Heidsieck, Pommery, Veuve Cliquot...
Moet Chandon...
I thought you were dead.
- I can't.
- You must.
Shit him out to forget him.
Come on. Be a good girl, open up.
That's the way. Come on.
One spoon for Mama...
One spoon for Papa...
My Papa doesn't exist, Mr. Psychic.
My mother left him before
I was even born.
- I wish I were dead.
- Open up.
You're brave.
You really went for it.
Really.
Cut off the dragon's hair...
and he screws my best friend.
Why didn't you warn me?
He's an asshole
who doesn't deserve you.
Now you tell me.
I want my money back.
My last chance. Your words.
Fanny Fink... Rest in peace
and become one with nature.
Now the earth.
Come on, Fanny, stop crying.
Take this glass.
Is it half full or half empty?
- Half empty.
- See? That's your problem.
Always moaning about
what you don't have.
Half full is never enough for you.
And you have so much, damn it!
A job, a place, a family,...
the right skin color. What can I say?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
- I'm going to die soon.
- What do you have?
...AIDS?
No...
But I don't have much time.
They'll be coming soon,
my brothers and sisters...
...to take me home...
To the planet Arcturus.
They're coming to get me.
It'll sound like a thousand airplanes.
I was lonely and unhappy,
didn't have anybody, wanted to die.
They took me to Arcturus
and cut out my unhappiness.
They operated on you?
They touched me with
fingers soft as rose petals.
Then they stuck a hot needle in me
and removed something.
The pain was inconceivable.
But it ended all the other pain.
Suddenly I was happy.
Happy as never before.
Why, why me, I asked.
They pointed at my emerald and said:
"That's how we know our brothers
and sisters. We will save you."
- They speak German?
- No, but I understood them.
- And then?
- Than?
They asked me if I wanted to stay
with them, and like a fool I shook my head.
I said I wanted to fall
in love one more time.
The feeling you can't get enough of.
Nobody learns from experience.
Falling in love...
I couldn't explain it to them.
So they brought me back here.
Just the way they came.
The same noise in the air.
Like a thousand planes.
And these spheres of white light.
- And did you fall in love?
- Yes, unfortunately.
- When are they coming back?
- When I die.
- To take you with them?
- Yes.
- And then you're just gone?
- Yes. Just gone.
- Your body will be a corpse.
- Your body will be a corpse.
Let us imagine how our corpse is bloated,
has turned blue and stinks.
Our bodies are seething
with insects and worms.
All that remains is a skeleton
with shreds of flesh and blood.
- Your body will be a corpse.
- Your body will be a corpse.
All that remains is a skeleton
with traces of blood, but no flesh.
The blood is gone soon,
and bones are all that remains.
Here an arm, there a shin. A skull.
All that remains is a pile
of bleached bones.
A pile of dried out bones.
Your body will be a corpse.
- Your body will be a corpse.
- Your body will be a corpse.
The bones decay...
and all that remains of us...
...is a handful of dust.
Your body will be a corpse.
Hello.
All the best.
- What for?
- Your birthday. From Charlotte too.
- Waitnig or are you ready to order?
- I...
... A glass of champagne and the caviar.
The caviar's out.
- The oysters.
- Out too.
- A cheese sandwich.
- A cheese sandwich and champagne?
No. I'll have tea instead.
They're coming soon
and I don't have a thing to wear.
Nathing to wear.
Wait!
- Know who that was?
- Yes, our bulding manager.
That was Hanuman,
the white ape general.
Watch out for him,
he'll tear your heart out.
He already has.
And he ate it?
He doesn't eat meat.
He threw it in the garbage.
Sorry to hear that.
Edith Piaf - Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien
(I do not regret nothing)
No, nothing at all.
No, I do not regret anything.
Neither of which I have done well.
Neither of evil, give me all the same!
No, nothing at all.
No, I do not regret anything.
It is paid, settled, forgotten,
I've forgotten the past
With my memories ...
I have fanned the flames.
My wounds, my pleasures,
I don't need need any more
Forgotten loves with its ups and downs
Forgotten forever.
I'll once more start from scratch.
No, nothing at all.
No, I do not regret anything.
Neither the good that I have done.
Neither evil; give me all the same!
No, nothing at all.
No, I do not regret anything.
Because my life,
Because my joys,
Today begins with you.
Tell me what it is or I'll get a doctor.
Please don't, you promised.
Can't I do anything?
Stay. Stay with me.
Just stay with me.
Stay with me till it's all over.
Where in Africa is Uagnosh?
In Senegal.
And not Uagnosh. Uag-nosh.
- Uag-nosh?
- Right. Like a worm summer wind.
- You have no accent.
- My mother was German. From Berlin.
Did she pass away?
Faster! Go faster!
Hurry! Faster! Faster!
I want you to have it.
You know, jewels are...
God's thoughts.
- It'll keep disappointments away.
- Please stop it, Orfeo.
- It's for you.
- Don't get so worked up.
I hear them sometimes.
I want to look classy
when they come.
I want to be in a suit
by Armani or Versace.
I've always wanted one.
- You're going to get well.
- They're coming!
You think I'm crazy, huh?
Then go!
Beat it, leave me alone...
if it's too much for you.
The only person you ever thnik
about is you. If you're being loved.
Go away! Leave me alone.
Let me die alone.
Damn it, leave me in peace.
Sorry,
I didn't mean it like that, Orfeo.
I want a present for them.
What were you thinking of?
Gold.
Gold to them is a miracle
from the wonderful planet Earth.
- You realize we charge 13.5% on a loan like this?
- Yes.
Fine. Then sign here.
Whant me to say "sorry"?
How could I know you were so serious?
Insane. Are you sure you have a grip
on reality? Why did you cut my hair off?
I wanted to possess you,
have your children
and grow old with you.
Oh, sure. Understand.
Whant to go eat with me?
You're the only friend I have
in the whole idiotic building.
Wait a moment!
I want my suit back.
It's an Armani, it cost a lot.
- I don't have it.
- What?
I threw it away.
You're not peeling an apple.
You have to eat something.
Is it that bad?
One more.
When you think you can't take it
just look at the clouds.
They'll be there when I'm gone.
Everything changes,
Nothing stays the same.
Including all the shit.
And what does it mean?
If you're hung there long enough,
everything works itself out.
"Piotr sat down across from him
and suddenly champagne was there."
"They were asked if they wished oysters,"
"the finest oysters just arrived."
What'll I take? The jewelry,
the case, the mountain bike.
And for my friend Fanny, the hairdryer.
I was with him 3 years, my boyfriend doctor
and I never saw him pee.
Or brush his teeth.
- He always locked the door.
- Bad sign.
How was he in bed?
Always had the kleenex ready.
And always hung his clothes up neatly.
Paper!
I yelled that when I wanted
my mother to wipe me.
- In África?
- Think they don't have toilet paper?
I love...
I love you...
I love you...
I love you... I love you...
I love you...
What does that mean?
I love you.
Same here.
Fanny?
Fanny!
The time's come.
Thanks.
Kiss me.
I love you.
Same here.
Don't be afraid, Fanny. Your past is
a skeleton that walks behind you.
Your future is the skeleton
in front of you.
Tey'll both never leave you. But...
sometimes they want to talk to you,
tell you to sit down,
relax, take a break.
They'll offer you a drink
and promise you everything you want.
But don't listen to them.
Keep going. Keep on going.
And don't wear a watch.
They'll remaind you what time it is.
It's always...
...the same time.
Understand? It's always now.
Now go.
You have to leave me alone
or they won't come.
Get out of here.
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
What is that?
What the hell is going on?
What is going on?
Do you know what happens?
Are you OK?
Come on!
Here I am!
Open it!
Give me the key!
Let me!
Shit!
It's the end.
Good God, what was that?
What was that noise?
Orfeo...
Orfeo?
FANNY FINK
SHE ATE NOTHING THAT HAD EYES
Can you here me?
I miss you so.
So much.
Will I be alone for good now?
My emerald.
It's not an emerald. No.
It's glass.
Just glass.
Good morning, Fanny.
Women...

- I have to move out.
- We all have to.
I didn't know.
Actually evicted. I can't belive it.
Oh, Shit!
- I'm claustrophobic!
- I have to pee.
- Let me out.
- Do something!
Would you like a cup of coffee?
- That goes for all of you.
- Yes.
I'd love one.
- I thought it was dances at parties.
- No food.
- The coffee tastes very good.
- Thanks.
- I don't like coffee.
Music.
Of course, music.
After all, what's a party without music.
Sorry.
Let me...
- You beat me to it.
- I what?
It would've taken me month
to talk to you again.
I'm kind of shy.
Half full or half empty?
Half full, why?
It was horrible burying you.
Your body will be a corpse.
But not just mine.
Would you like to dance?
I come back right away.
Orfeo!
When will you have had enough?
Stop grinning.
No, nothing at all,
No, I do not regret anything
Neither of which I have done well,
Neither of evil, give me all the same!
No, nothing at all,
No, I do not regret anything
It is paid, settled, forgotten,
I've forgotten the past
With my memories
I have fanned the flames.
My sorrows, my pleasures,
I don't need need any more
Forgotten loves with its ups and downs
Forgotten forever.
I'll once more start from scratch
No, nothing at all
No, I do not regret anything
Neither of which I have done well
Neither of evil, all that I do not care
No, nothing at all,
No, I do not regret anything
Because my life,
Because my joys,
Today begins with you.
END
