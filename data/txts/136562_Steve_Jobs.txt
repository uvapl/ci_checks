And with that movie
<i>2001,</i> you're projecting us
into the 21st century.
I brought along
my son Jonathan--
hi.
Who in the year 2001
will be the same age
as I am now.
Maybe he will be better adjusted
to this kind of world
that you're trying to portray.
The big difference,
when he grows up--
in fact,
if we wanted to wait
till the year 2001--
he will have
in his own house
not a computer as big as this,
but at least a console
through which he can talk
to his friendly local computer
and get all the information
he needs for his everyday life,
like his bank statements,
his theater reservations,
all the information you need
in the course of living in
a complex modern society.
This will be in a compact form
in his own house.
He'll have a television screen,
like these here, and a keyboard.
And he'll talk to the computer
and get information from it.
And he'll take it
as much for granted
as we take the telephone.
I wonder, though,
what sort of a life would it
be like in social terms?
I mean, if our whole life
is built around the computer,
do we become
a computer-dependent society?
In some ways, but they will
also enrich our society
because it will make it
possible for us to live,
really, anywhere we like.
Any businessman and executive
could live almost anywhere
on earth
and still do his business
through a device like this.
And this is a wonderful thing.
It means we won't have to be
stuck in cities.
We'll be able to live out
in the country
or wherever we please.
<i>Screen says</i>
<i>it's an unimplemented trap.</i>
<i>But the error code is wrong.</i>
<i>It's a system error.</i>
<i>So what's the upshot?</i>
<i> It absolutely is</i>
<i> gonna say hello.</i>
<i>It's nobody's fault.</i>
<i>It's a system error.</i>
<i> You built the voice demo.</i>
The voice demo is flaky.
Keep your voices down.
I've been telling you
that for--
this thing is overbuilt.
It worked last night.
It worked the night
before that.
It worked
three hours ago.
It's not working now, so just
skip over the voice demo.
Fuck you.
Everything else
is working.
Shh.
Skip over
the voice demo.
We need it
to say hello.
You're not hearing me.
It's not going to say hello.
Just fix it.
Fix it?
Yeah.
In 40 minutes?
Fix it.
I can't.
Who's the person
who can?
I'm the person who can,
and I can't.
How bad are you
saying?
It's pretty bad.
I don't know what that means.
It means the demo is more
than likely gonna crash.
You have to keep
your voices down.
Joel pforzheimer is
sitting out in the house.
I don't care if--
who's Joel pforzheimer?
<i> Gq.</i>
He's been shadowing you
for a week.
Did you notice?
Just look like
everything's fine.
He's sitting out
in the house.
Hey.
What are you guys
saying?
Some kind of race condition,
but we haven't been able
to track it down yet.
Is the synthesizer sampling
fast enough?
No, so the rates are off
and it keeps crashing.
It's 20 seconds
out of a two-hour launch.
Why not just cut it?
We can't cut it.
Yeah,
you just cut it.
Two days ago, we ran a
super bowl ad that could've won
the Oscar for best short film.
There are more people who can
tell you about the ad than can
tell you who won the game.
I understand,
but the ad said the Mac
was gonna save the world.
It didn't say it
was gonna say hello.
We open the house in five.
Don't open the house.
We're taking
a quick break.
Part of
the problem is--
what?
We can recompile,
but if it's a hardware problem,
we can't get into the back.
Why not?
Do you wanna tell her
or should I?
Don't start with me, man.
Why can't he get
into the machine?
You need special tools.
What kind of special tools?
Just take a screwdriver.
He didn't want users
to be able to open it.
You need special tools.
Is this for real?
There are a hundred engineers
walking around here.
None of them have the tools?
In fairness,
not many of them
were issued the tools.
What about you?
I left them at the office.
It was 3:00 am when i--
oh, Jesus Christ.
- Cut "hello."
- No.
What's the first rule
of a launch?
It's not gonna crash.
It just did.
Andy!
Which one?
The other Andy.
You're right there.
Why would I be calling out?
He needs to talk
to you.
Yeah.
The exit signs need
to be off or we're not
gonna get a full blackout.
We've spoken to the building
manager and the fire marshal.
And?
There's no way
they're gonna let us
turn the exit signs off.
I'll pay whatever
the fine is.
The fine is
they're gonna come in
and tell everyone to leave.
You explained to
the fire marshal that we're
in here changing the world?
I did, but unless we can also
change the properties of fire,
he doesn't care.
Steve--
if a fire causes a stampede
to the unmarked exits,
it'll have been well worth it
for those who survive.
For those who don't,
less so,
but still pretty good.
- Look, i--
- I need it to go black.
Real black.
Get rid of the exit signs
and don't let me know
how you did it.
Fix the voice demo.
You need special tools
to open the Mac?
You knew it was
a closed system.
I didn't know literally.
Jesus.
And if you keep alienating
people for no reason,
there's gonna be no one left
for it to say hello to.
It's not for no reason.
We blow this and IBM
will own the next 50 years
like a Batman villain.
Remember the phone company?
That's what bell was called,
"the phone company."
IBM will be
the computer company.
Ten years later they'll
be the information company,
and that's very bad
for the human race.
So we don't have time to be
polite or realistic,
'cause if we are,
this company's next
product launch
will be held
in front of 26 people
and a stringer from
the Alameda county
shopper's guide.
We haven't advertised
the voice software.
We could pull it out
of the demo and no one
would be disappointed.
Do you want to try
being reasonable,
just, you know,
see what it feels like?
Okay.
Pull the voice demo.
Thank you.
And then
cancel the launch.
I see. You just
tricked me
a little.
You can tell me how unimportant
it is, but if the computer
doesn't say hello,
then neither will John sculley,
who I promise you
agrees with me.
Sculley's not gonna
cancel the launch
'cause he's not insane.
He's also not a hack,
and when it comes
to the macintosh,
he's gonna do
what I ask him to do.
What's in this box?
Nothing you need
to worry about.
Don't even open it.
What the fuck?
Why is there a carton of--
who did this?
Somebody thought--
who?
Doesn't matter. Thought it
would be a good idea to have
copies of that<i> time</i> cover
available at everyone's seat.
It was nipped in the bud
and all the copies are being
taken out of the building.
So problem solved.
This isn't a macintosh.
I understand.
Somebody thought
it would be a good idea
to, like,
enthusiastically hand over
copies of<i> time</i> with a
not-a-macintosh on the cover
at the launch
of the macintosh?
What are they handing out
at hewlett-packard?
A bushel of apples
with my face on them?
I'm sure the thinking was
that since the computer
is man of the year
that that's good
for our business,
but like I said,
I'm having them
removed from the building.
What I'd like you to do
with them is to take them,
all 2,600 copies,
and stack them
on kottke's desk
and tell him Steve says,
"happy new year to you."
Okay.
I gave<i> time</i> magazine
full access.
The whole campus:
Bandley, apple ii, Lisa.
I gave him sculley, markkula.
I gave him woz.
I gave him everybody.
What should I call the person
who thought it'd be
a good idea to hand these out?
I'm not telling you
who it was.
It was done without malice.
It's been taken care of.
You have a half hour
and we have things
to talk about.
Like what?
Like a million
in the first 90 days.
Joanna--
20,000 a month
after that.
Look.
Those are the forecasts.
I'm begging--
this is my field.
I'm begging you to manage
expectations out there.
I'm fanning expectations.
We're not gonna sell a million
in the first 90 days.
Everyone, everyone,
everyone,
<i>everyone</i> is waiting
for the Mac.
Maybe.
But what happens
when they find out
that for 2,495,
there's nothing
you can do with it?
We were competitive
at $1,500,
but once you replaced
the motorola 6809
with the 68000--
which is what supports menus,
windows, point and click,
high-res graphics--
yeah, 'cause everyone
needs rectangles
with rounded corners.
Coach lands on the runway
at the exact same time
as first class.
I don't have the first
fucking idea
what that means,
but this is how
it got to $2,500,
which is the price point
on the PC,
which can do a lot more!
Who's gonna want a PC?
What idiot is gonna want--
if I wanna tell you
there's a spot on your shirt,
i point to the spot.
I don't say there's a spot
14 centimeters
down from the collar
and three centimeters
to the right
of the second button
while I try to remember
what the command is
for club soda.
That's not how
a person's mind works.
If the goal was ease of use,
maybe you should've
given it some memory.
You can complain about memory
or you can complain
about price,
but you can't do both
at the same time.
Memory is what costs money.
I'm glad you're telling me
your feelings
about the Mac now
because we have
a half hour left.
We can redesign it.
I'm just asking you
to manage expectations.
Look at their faces
when they see what it is.
They won't know what they're
looking at or why they like it,
but they'll know they want it.
Not instantly.
When people heard
<i> rite of spring,</i>
they tore the chairs
out of the theater.
They didn't buy
the record.
<i> Rite of spring</i>
happens to be
the most revolutionary
and provocative symphony
of the last century.
Ballet.
It was a ballet.
But Igor stravinsky
didn't say he was gonna
sell 20,000 units a month.
I don't know why we're
talking about stravinsky
when what I care about
is Dan kottke sodomizing me
in<i> time</i> magazine.
Look. Obviously--
let me say this to you.
Obviously, Daniel didn't think
he was doing anything wrong.
By talking to<i> time</i>
about it?
Yeah.
I don't know
what that means.
You said,
when you told me the story--
you said you said to Dan,
"did<i> time</i> magazine
ask you if I had
a daughter named Lisa?"
And Dan said, "yeah."
My point was that he answered
you simply and honestly
because he didn't think
he'd done anything wrong.
Except, Joanna--
except I don't have
a daughter named Lisa.
And this story is now
about how I'm denying paternity
and took a blood test.
And that's why there's
a picture of-- I don't know
what the fuck that is.
That's why there's
a picture of a PC
on the cover
instead of a picture
of me and the Mac.
I don't know
what to tell you.
I was supposed to be<i> time</i>
magazine's man of the year.
And then Dan kottke
was born.
Well--
what?
She's waiting for you.
Who?
Chrisann.
Brennan?
They're out in the hall.
They've been sitting
in the back of the auditorium
since 7:00 this morning.
I'm not having a session
with chrisann right now.
We issued
335 press credentials
for the launch.
Steve,
you piss off chrisann,
she's gonna stand
in the lobby
and give 335 interviews,
and you, pal, will be
longing for the halcyon days
of Dan kottke.
Let me get this
over with.
But don't leave.
You're gonna stay here.
What? No.
I'm not.
No. There's less of a chance
of a scene if you stay here.
She'll be cool.
I find all this excruciatingly
personal and-and--
i-I'm-- I'm not staying.
No. Come on.
I don't wanna be
in a room alone
with chrisann.
This is me and you.
Fine.
Hey.
Steve.
This is a surprise.
Why don't you
come on in?
Thank you.
- You coming too?
- Yes, I'm not gonna leave her
in the hallway.
Okay.
It's a safe hallway,
but anyway.
You remember Joanna Hoffman?
She's the head of marketing
for the Mac.
Good to see you.
Nice to see you.
Hello, Lisa.
We've met before,
and you told me
you like the way I talk,
and that was
my favorite thing
anyone's ever said to me.
You're from Poland.
Yes, I am.
- Do you know where that is?
- The top of the earth.
I think you're thinking
of the north pole.
Well, we're a little
pressed for time, so--
- I'll leave you guys alone.
- Why do you wanna leave
when you just said--
I'm gonna check in
with hertzfeld.
We're trying to get
a computer to say hello,
but right now
it's being very shy.
Would you come help me?
Is that okay?
Sure.
Thank you.
My dad named a computer
after me.
I'm not your--
actually, do you know
what a coincidence is, Lisa?
No.
Like if you met someone.
You made a new friend
and her name was Lisa too.
That would be a coincidence.
"Lisa" stands for
"local integrated
systems architecture."
L-i-s-a.
It's a coincidence.
- You about done?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Come. Let's make
that computer say hi.
Go ahead, Lisa.
So it was
the other way around.
I was named
after the computer?
Nothing was named
after anybody.
It's a coincidence.
Come on.
What's the matter
with you?
What's the matter with you?
Why are you telling her
these things?
Why are you
still telling her
I'm her father?
- A judge told her
you're her father.
- No, he didn't.
Where the hell
do you get off
telling<i> time</i> magazine
I've slept with 28 percent
of the men in America?
That's not--
where do you
get off?
That's not remotely
what I said.
It's right here.
First of all,
can I tell you something
about<i> time</i> magazine?
I believe
it's a training facility
for paid assassins.
"Jobs insists"--
i am quoting--
i didn't invent math.
"...twenty-eight
percent of the male population
of the United States
could be the father."
I wasn't saying
you've slept with 28%
of American men.
I was using an algorithm
based on the blood test
which said there was a 94.1%
chance that I'm the father.
You're trying
to publicly paint me
as a slut and a whore.
Believe me,
I'm not trying to publicly
do anything with you.
Two million people
read<i> time.</i>
How am I supposed--
it would be more if they put
me on the cover, but Dan kottke
decided to kidney-punch me--
- I applied for
welfare yesterday.
I'm sorry?
- Hello!
- I said I applied
for welfare yesterday.
The<i> time</i> article said
your apple stock was worth
$441 million,
and I wanted to ask you
how you felt about that.
Well, I feel like
apple stock has been
dramatically undervalued.
This would be
a good time to get in.
Your daughter
and her mother--
chrisann--
are on welfare.
We're living in a hovel
in menlo park.
We can't pay
the heating bills.
She sleeps in a parka.
Your daughter--
she's not my daughter!
Because, as reported
by<i> time</i> magazine,
- I've slept with 28%
of the men in America?
- No.
All of them,
exactly nine months
before Lisa was born.
I've got Andy here.
Excuse me.
We're there?
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Andy.
- How are you doin'?
- Terrible.
You guys caught up now?
Excuse me for saying hello
to my friend,
who thinks you're a dick.
I don't think
you're a--
we're there?
No. It's got a one-in-six
chance of working.
Goddamn it.
Well, we're not
a pit crew at Daytona.
This can't be fixed in seconds.
You didn't have seconds.
You had three weeks.
The universe
was created in a third
of that time.
Well, someday you'll
have to tell us
how you did it.
Here's what
I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna announce
the names of everyone who
designed the launch demo.
I'm gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up.
The bag was designed
by Susan kare.
The macintosh font that's
scrolling across the screen
was designed by Steve capps.
The starry night
and skywriting
was Bruce horn.
Macpaint, macwrite, Alice,
down to the calculator.
And then I'm gonna say
the voice demo
that didn't work
was designed
by Andy hertzfeld.
Steve--
five-in-six is your chance
of surviving the first round
of Russian roulette,
and you've reversed those odds.
So unless you wanna be disgraced
in front of your friends,
family, colleagues,
stockholders and the press,
I wouldn't stand here
arguing.
I'd go try and get some more
bullets out of the gun.
Do it, Andy!
Stop. You.
What size shirt
do you wear?
Me?
Does anyone know
what size shirt he wears?
What size shirt I wear?
Does anyone know
where the closest
psychiatrist is?
The disk
fits in your pocket.
I need a shirt
with a breast pocket.
I can take it out onstage.
A shirt?
The disk!
I need a white shirt
in my size
with a breast pocket.
Yes. Which one
of the no stores
that are open at 8:45
do you want me to have someone
run to and return from
in 15 minutes?
Go out in the lobby,
find someone my size
who's wearing a white shirt.
Tell them I'll trade them
for a free computer,
and they get
to keep my shirt.
Does it have to be
a white shirt?
Is blue okay?
No. The Mac is beige, I'm beige,
the disk is blue,
the shirt has to be white.
Andy?
Hello, I'm macintosh.
Bring me the head
of Andy hertzfeld.
I tried to get it
to say hello,
but it's shy.
Yeah.
So that's it?
That's it.
I don't get it.
I know.
What are people
going to do with it?
Lisa,
how old are you now?
- You know how old she is.
- How old are you, Lisa?
Five.
Come sit here for a minute.
Do you know
what this is?
It's a computer.
It's a computer.
Can I borrow your hand
for a second?
Point that arrow
and click.
You don't have to,
but if you want,
you can play with it.
Nothing you can do
will break it, so just
do whatever you want with it.
What are you doing?
I'm paying you
exactly what the court
ordered me to pay you.
$385 a month.
I'm not the one
who decided
on that amount.
And I'm asking you
how you feel.
If you feel
all right.
If it feels all right to you
that your daughter--
she's not my--
that your daughter
and her mother
are on welfare
while you're worth
$441 million
for making that.
I'm proud to say
apple donates computers
to underfunded schools,
- and we'll be doing more
of the same with the Mac--
- what?
Apple donates millions
of dollars' worth
of computers to schools.
What does that
have to do with--
imagine an underprivileged kid
that has their favorite teacher
with them 24 hours.
We're minutes away
from being able to do that.
In your head,
was that an answer
to my question?
Tell me the question again.
I wasn't the one
who sued you
for child support.
- No, let--
- San Mateo county
sued you.
No, let me explain
what happened, 'cause I have
plenty of time right now.
Excuse me.
You have a visitor.
Just wanted to say
good luck.
Hey, chrisann.
Hello, woz.
Hang on.
Just wanted to say
good luck.
Thanks. You too.
It's a big morning.
Yeah.
You should see
this crowd out there.
This crowd,
it's like, um--
I can't really wait
for you to come up
with a metaphor, man.
Yeah. So, listen, I want
to ask you a favor.
Yeah?
Can you acknowledge the apple ii
team in your remarks?
I cannot.
Just an acknowledgement.
Have them stand up.
- We're launching the Mac.
- It'd be a morale booster.
Just a mention
so they could get
a round of applause.
Just a mention.
Can we stick a pin in this
for a minute?
Sure.
Thank you.
Just talking about
an acknowledgement
for the team.
I've got chrisann in there.
I'll see you in a second.
Yep.
That.
What?
You asked me what people
are gonna do with it.
They're gonna do that.
One of the engineers.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
I'm sorry?
It's an abstract.
You used macpaint.
Push that key and the "s"
at the same time.
Now type your name.
Do you know
which box says "save"?
Right.
Go ahead
and click on it.
I'll put some money
in your account
and buy you a new house,
someplace near a decent school.
Thank you.
Woz wants a minute.
And sculley's
asking for you.
We're done?
Could you teach me
more things?
On the computer?
Lisa, wait for me
in the hall, please.
You can put your coat on
in the hall.
Bye, Lisa.
- Bye.
- Lisa, in the hall. Now.
I wanna know,
when you say you're gonna
put money in my account,
how much
we're talking about.
It's a school day.
She needs to be in school.
I'm gonna give you
whatever you need.
Woz wants me
to acknowledge
the apple ii team.
You must be able to see
that she looks like you.
I don't want to insult woz.
I just think
it's backward-looking
at exactly the wrong moment.
- I know you heard what I said.
- I heard what you said, Joanna.
It's just we're about to do
this thing.
At 9:41, the planet's
gonna shift on its axis
nigh and forever.
Two most significant events
of the 20th century:
The allies win the war
and this.
This.
So maybe right now
isn't the very best time
to scold me
for not being
a better father to a kid
who's not my kid.
The test said i--
i don't care
what the test said.
I don't care
about 94.1%
or the insane algorithm
you used to get to 28%
of American men.
Buying her a new house.
I'm giving her money.
There's a small girl who
believes you're her father.
That's all.
That's all the math
there is.
She believes it.
What are you gonna do
about that?
God sent his only son
on a suicide mission,
but we like him anyway
because he made trees.
We're gonna sell
a million units
in the first 90 days.
20,000 a month after that.
So maybe you could give me
a break, Ms. Hoffman?
Woz.
Hey.
There's nothing
in that vending machine
that won't kill you.
Just browsing.
Let's take a walk.
- Can I tell you
something?
- Yeah.
After the meeting in Maui,
the apple ii team was upset
and angry and down.
Do you know why?
Because the apple ii
wasn't mentioned even once?
The apple ii
wasn't mentioned ev--
yes, that's it.
You have it. Yes.
That wasn't an oversight.
They know that.
They know it wasn't.
I don't wanna
make a big deal
out of this--
that's entirely
within your power.
The apple ii is--
the apple ii is what was,
my friend.
The apple ii is what pays
the bills around here
and has for seven years.
And if you embarrass
these people,
you are going to see
a brain drain at this company,
my brother.
Markkula took you off the Lisa,
not them and not me,
so don't blame--
markkula took me off the Lisa
because of his strong religious
objection to making it good.
Now I gave you
everything you wanted
on the apple ii.
You don't ask for a lot?
There wasn't
a single fight you lost.
Do you concede the slots
are the reason for
the success of the apple ii?
We can't still be
talking about the slots.
I have a point.
It's been seven years.
You're still doing it.
You're talking about the slots.
There's something wrong
with you. This argument started
in the garage.
What are you talking about?
Why would you only want
two slots?
A printer and a modem.
With eight slots,
you--
this is a huge deal
that we were able
to add eight slots.
I appreciate the engineering,
but it's not what we're doing.
And thank god
i won that argument--
woz.
Because the open system
is what people love
about the machine,
and it's why it sold
and still sells.
An open system.
We're not doing
an open system.
Of course we are. That's what
people want, and the
breakthrough on the apple ii--
people don't know
what they want until
you show it to them.
Serious users want to customize.
They wanna modify.
They wanna Jack it up.
They want hardware engineers
like me to expand
its capabilities, okay?
Keyboards for music,
better sound board,
better display boards,
improved memory cards.
And it's why
there are 3,000 people
here right now.
The slots are what allowed
the apple ii to run,
for just one example, visicalc,
which from my guess
single-handedly sold between
200,000 and 300,000 machines.
They want slots.
They don't get a vote.
When Dylan wrote "shelter from
the storm," he didn't ask people
to contribute to the lyrics.
Plays don't stop
so the playwright
can ask the audience
what scene
they'd like to see next.
Painters--
hobbyists--
we're on the verge
of a tectonic--
hobbyists?
A printer and a modem.
Two slots.
The apple ii team
has my affection,
but I'm not loving up
a seven-year-old product
at the Mac launch.
Computers
aren't paintings.
Fuck you.
I'm gonna say "fuck you"
every time you say that
until you either die or stop.
- Steve--
- try it.
Steve.
Say it.
- Computers aren't paintings.
- Fuck you.
Yes, they are,
and what I want
is a closed system.
End-to-end control.
Completely incompatible
with anything.
Computers aren't supposed
to have human flaws.
I'm not going to build
this one with yours.
Steve!
Hey.
Today is
about the macintosh.
And the Mac is mine.
- I give you that.
- Thank you.
I give you that.
Just publicly acknowledge
the apple ii team
'cause it's
the right thing to do.
We'll know soon enough
if you are Leonardo Da Vinci
or just think you are,
but in the meantime,
it would be great--
in the meantime,
the apple ii is done.
Seven years.
It was a great run.
You should go out
in the house
and take your seat.
The Mac is jef raskin's.
Say it for me.
Computers aren't--
fuck you.
All right.
Five, six--
we're there?
I need more time.
You can't have it.
20 minutes.
It's 8:58.
We can start late.
Hear me.
We're a computer company.
We can't start late.
Then I have
another idea.
What?
It's deceptive
and borderline unethical.
I'm listening.
It'll run on the 512.
- You tested it?
- Yeah.
- Wait. You're gonna demo
a 128 computer on a 512?
- Nobody's gonna know.
And you think that's
<i>borderline</i> unethical?
Name my other choices,
please.
Please. You have to tell me
why it's so important
for it to say hello.
Hollywood.
They made computers
scary things.
See how this reminds you
of a friendly face, that
the disk slot is a goofy grin?
It's warm and it's playful
and it needs to say hello.
It needs to say hello
because it can.
We're not
committing fraud.
The 512 is gonna ship
in under a year.
Will you absolve me
of your eastern European
disapproval?
The computer in<i> 2001</i> said
hello all the time and it still
scared the shit out of me.
Absolve me.
Just for this.
And just for now.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome founding
board member Mike markkula.
All right.
Okay.
Go make a dent
in the universe, Steven.
See you in
a couple hours.
And I'm going to take us
through the formal part
of the meeting,
the legal part,
if you will.
- Thank merciful god.
- The cavalry's shown up.
I hear you've been worse
than usual this morning. I
didn't think that was possible.
So I've been dispatched
as the "Steve whisperer."
This is a '55 margaux.
It's 9:00 in the morning.
This is a '55 margaux.
Is it my imagination
or have you started
to dress like me?
It was a bad idea
to have markkula open
with quarterly reports.
Instead we should have
just dropped water
on the audience.
You know, just big 10,000-gallon
tanks of cold water,
dropped from the ceiling.
Save Mike some money
on index cards.
Oh, just relax.
Why?
I don't know.
No one's ever asked me
that question.
There you go.
You're the only one
who sees the world
the same way I do.
No one sees the world
the same way you do.
I'm like Julius Caesar,
John.
I'm surrounded
by enemies.
No, you're not.
The board--
oh, the board.
The board's behind you.
Only because you see to it
they are.
I think it's a good board,
but if you want me
to push them out one by one,
we can talk about that.
I want you to push them
out all at once--
through a window,
if it's the nearest exit.
The look on their faces
when we showed them the spot.
I couldn't see their faces,
'cause they were banging
their heads on the table.
Yeah, yeah.
Yesterday, the day
after it airs<i> once,</i>
the publisher of<i> adweek</i>
calls it the best
commercial of all time.
Of all time!
And it is.
And if anyone does one better,
it's gonna be chiat/day,
who the board wanted to replace,
and it's gonna be Lee clow,
who the board thought
was out of his mind.
<i></i><i>Ladies and gentlemen, "1984."</i>
<i></i><i> The first</i>
<i> glorious anniversary</i>
<i> of the information</i>
<i> purification directives.</i>
<i> We have created</i>
<i> for the first time</i>
<i> in all history</i>
<i> a garden of pure ideology</i>
<i>where each worker may bloom,</i>
<i>secure from the pests</i>
<i>purveying</i>
<i>contradictory thoughts.</i>
<i>Our unification of thoughts</i>
<i>is more powerful a weapon</i>
<i>than any fleet or army on earth.</i>
<i>We are one people--</i>
did we use skinheads
as extras?
- A couple of people
have told me that.
- Yeah.
We paid skinheads?
I've got skinheads
on my payroll?
They had a look
you wanted.
The skinheads?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's keep that
to ourselves.
<i> We shall prevail.</i>
<i>On January 24th,</i>
<i>apple computer</i>
<i>will introduce macintosh.</i>
Who else knows?
Who else knows what?
That we paid terrorists
to be in our TV commercial.
John--
they were wrong about the ad,
but they're a good board.
Good people.
Their only problem--
their problem
is that they're people.
People.
The very nature of people
is something to be overcome.
When I was running Pepsi,
we had a lot of success
focusing on 18-to-55-year-olds
who weren't members
of violent hate groups.
I get it.
You're not surrounded
by enemies.
We're almost there.
I'm back and forth
on the Dylan.
I might quote
a different verse.
What are the choices?
"For the loser now
will be later to win,"
which is what we have.
Mm-hmm. Or?
"Come mothers and fathers
throughout the land
and don't criticize
what you can't understand.
Your sons and your daughters"--
"are beyond your command."
I just lost
a hundred bucks
to Andy hertzfeld.
He said you'd change it
to that verse.
We got 45 seconds.
I want to use it
to ask you a question.
Why do people who are adopted
feel like they were rejected
instead of selected?
That came out of nowhere.
"Your sons
and your daughters
are beyond your command.
Your old road
is rapidly aging."
So go fuck yourself,
because my name
is Steve Jobs,
and the times,
they are a-changin'.
I don't feel
rejected.
You're sure?
Very sure.
'Cause it's not like
the baby is born
and the parents look and say,
"nah, we're not interested
in this one."
On the other hand,
someone did choose you.
It's having no control.
You find out you were
out of the loop
when the most crucial
events in your life
were set in motion.
As long as
you have control.
I don't understand people
who give it up.
What inspired hertzfeld
to make that bet?
He was warning me
that being your father figure
could be dangerous.
Keep your 100 bucks.
I'm sticking
with the first verse.
Good.
What the hell
does he mean?
Nothing.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you, boss.
It's my pleasure
to introduce my friend
and the ceo of apple,
John sculley.
John?
Yeah?
Lisa made a painting
on the Mac.
<i>The macintosh, apple's near</i>
<i>mythological home computer,</i>
<i>has gotten off to a rocky start</i>
<i>in its battle</i>
<i>with industry titan IBM.</i>
<i>With sales</i>
<i>originally projected to be</i>
<i>a million in the first quarter,</i>
<i>apple has sold only 35,000</i>
<i>of the user-friendly machines</i>
<i>in the months since it's been</i>
<i>available to customers.</i>
<i>The insistence by Steve Jobs</i>
<i>that it have what's called</i>
<i>end-to-end control,</i>
<i>which is a way of saying that</i>
<i>it's not compatible with most</i>
<i>outside hardware or software,</i>
<i>is the shakespearean flaw</i>
<i>in a machine that</i> had<i> potential.</i>
<i>Apple computers closed</i>
<i>two of its factories today</i>
<i>in the wake</i>
<i>of disappointing sales.</i>
<i>Do you know how many macs</i>
<i>were sold last month? 500.</i>
<i>In a move that surprised some</i>
<i>but not all on wall street,</i>
<i>the board of directors</i>
<i>of apple computers voted today</i>
<i>to fire its cofounder</i>
<i>Steve Jobs.</i>
<i>Did he jump</i>
<i>or was he pushed?</i>
<i>His ex-boss,</i>
<i>apple ceo John sculley,</i>
<i>refused to comment.</i>
<i>However,</i>
<i>in an exclusive interview,</i>
<i>Steve wozniak has slammed</i>
<i>the integrity of his old friend</i>
<i>Steve Jobs.</i>
<i>He calls jobs</i>
<i>an insulting and hurtful guy.</i>
<i>Jobs is hitting back with a new</i>
<i>company and a new computer.</i>
<i>Apple has a new competitor.</i>
<i>Steve Jobs's black cube</i>
<i>is aimed</i>
<i>at the education market.</i>
<i>Few people have the ability</i>
<i>to make the world wait,</i>
<i>but that is just</i>
<i>what jobs is doing</i>
<i>with his new company, next.</i>
<i>Focus seems kind of sharp.</i>
<i>On the slide?</i>
The floor.
The pin spot.
I think we want
a sharp focus.
Don't take it personally.
Just not a fan
of the circus aesthetic.
All right, let's hold here.
We're gonna have to go up
and refocus the instruments.
Just one. The 30 is fine.
While we're holding,
there are well-wishers
in the vip room.
And woz is here.
Steve wozniak.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
<i>And Andy hertzfeld.</i>
Andy hertzfeld.
Thank you.
<i>John sculley is here too.</i>
It's nice
that he's here.
Really? I don't think
it's very nice at all.
You have to see them.
They wanna pay their respects.
If they were respectful,
we'd all still be at apple
right now.
Look--
if they really
wished me well, they'd
keep to themselves.
Can I tell you something?
I don't think they do
wish me well.
<i>But I'm all right with that.</i>
<i>I'm over apple.</i>
I got over the Mac
and woz and sculley,
the same way you get over
your high school sweetheart.
Build a new one.
Can I tell you
something?
Yes.
You said you wouldn't
compete with them,
but you designed a computer
specifically for
the education market,
which they putatively own.
So, I think it's cool
they're here.
They're suing me.
Still.
It was nice they came.
They're not
being magnanimous.
They want it to look
like an amicable divorce.
History doesn't remember
Joe DiMaggio kindly
for dumping Marilyn.
Steve?
What's your problem?
I don't know,
but I'm sure it can
be traced back to you.
You know, I'm the one
who has to explain you
to people.
$100,000 to Paul rand
for a corporate logo
when we didn't even know
what our company made.
A $650,000 mold
for the cube,
because god forbid
the angles be 90.1
instead of 90.
I forbid the angles
to be 90.1
instead of 90.
That box
could be on display
at the guggenheim.
Don't give them reason
to say to the press
you have a chip
on your shoulder.
Will you do that
for me?
I don't have a chip
on my shoulder.
Okay, okay.
But don't give them
a reason
to say you do.
I don't.
That's the right
attitude.
That's not an attitude.
They're gonna call me back
in a minute
to look at the light.
Get one
out of the way.
Fine!
Yeah?
Yeah.
One more thing.
Sure.
No questions
from the press after.
No-- why?
Until I have better answers,
no press avail.
Somebody asks where I am,
you just saw me,
and I'll be right back.
Okay.
Who do you want
first?
Bring me the face
of Steve wozniak.
Hang on.
I thought you
went to school.
Hang on.
You were supposed to go
to school an hour ago.
I thought you left.
I didn't wake up my mom
on time this morning.
It's happened before
too.
I wake up with the alarm
and then I get dressed
and eat breakfast,
but sometimes I forget
to see what time it is
after that.
- Why doesn't your mom just
set her own alarm clock?
- It's one of my chores.
I don't understand
what that has to do
with why you're still--
where's your mother?
<i>She went to find a pay phone.</i>
An hour ago, she said--
you don't have
to raise your hand.
You said it was off
by a little.
It is.
- I just measured it.
- Joanna--
exactly a foot
on all four sides.
There are six sides.
But you're not supposed
to be here right now.
We know if four
of the sides are equal
to each other,
the other two
must be equal as well.
The top, bottom,
right and left
are about a millimeter shorter
than the front and back.
They're not.
I measured them.
Lisa, I'm kind of an expert
in design.
And that's a 20-cent ruler.
You think there's a chance
it could be off?
If I had another ruler,
i would measure this ruler,
but I really doubt it's off.
When your mother comes back,
you have to go to school.
Because it's a ruler!
Why is it off?
Did you hear
what I just said?
Yes.
Because sometimes it seems
like you just keep saying
what you want
without listening.
I'm listening.
Is there something
you need?
No.
Why isn't it
a perfect cube?
You've asked me before.
I forget what it is.
It's an optical anomaly.
To the human eye,
a perfect cube
doesn't look like a cube,
so we made it roughly
a millimeter shorter
than a foot on two sides.
What's an anomaly?
You've asked me that
before too.
I don't know why you keep
doing that.
It's an exception.
Something that doesn't
fit a pattern.
You have to go to school.
Come in!
I think you two
have met.
Hello, old friend.
- You look well.
- So do you. So do you.
And they're telling me
George is ready for you
to look at the focus.
Take a walk with me.
Is this Lisa?
Yeah.
- This can't be Lisa.
- It is.
Lisa's this big.
They get taller.
Come on.
- Do you remember me?
- She doesn't.
I'm your dad's friend
Steve wozniak.
I apologize.
I don't remember you.
You're very polite.
- Woz?
- Yeah.
- Chrisann's at a pay phone.
- Would you find her?
Yeah.
<i>Good turnout.</i>
- Great turnout.
- Yeah.
"Insanely great."
Insanely great.
This is the first time
we haven't played
for the same team.
It's like you're releasing
your first solo album.
I, uh-- I appreciate
your inviting me
to the launch.
I just want to wipe
the slate clean.
That's exactly what I want.
That's why I came backstage.
I want you to know,
um, I'll be out there
with you.
Any chance I can get you
to go out there
instead of me?
I love you, Steve.
I love you too, woz.
You know,
some things were said.
- They were.
- They were said in public.
They were published.
Were you pressured to do it?
Was I what?
Check it out.
It's the orchestra pit
for the San Francisco opera.
Was I pressured
to do it?
I once met seiji ozawa
at tanglewood.
A thunderous conductor.
Ungodly artfulness
and nuance.
And I asked him what exactly
a conductor does
that a metronome can't.
- Surprisingly, he--
- he didn't beat the living
shit out of you?
That's right. No, he said,
"the musicians
play their instruments.
I play the orchestra."
That feels like something
that sounds good,
but doesn't mean anything.
Markkula, sculley--
did they ask you
to slag me off in the press?
I had reason
to be angry.
Did they?
Absolutely not.
But they asked you
to talk.
Apple was under siege.
You'd just left the company.
Someone had to talk
to the press.
I'm right here, woz.
The company left me.
I begged you.
I begged you.
The apple ii accounted
for 70% of the revenue.
What did you think
was gonna happen?
You didn't care enough
about the apple ii
or the Lisa.
Let's be really clear.
I didn't care at all
about the apple ii
or the Lisa.
I wasn't pressured
to do it.
What I said to the press
was an honest, if tempered,
reflection of what I believed.
- Woz.
- Yeah?
What the fuck
is on your wrist?
- You wanna know?
- I literally can't wait.
Everyone's gonna be wearing
these in 10 years.
It's a nixie watch,
made using nixie tubes.
This is actually
40-year-old technology.
Cold cathode tubes.
They're operating
at 140 volts.
I tilt my wrist 45 degrees,
it's right there.
Hours, minutes
and seconds.
The way our minds work.
Look at that.
Do me a favor.
Set the watch ahead
like you're on a plane
and just changed
time zones.
Not a problem.
Unscrew that.
Just hit the button.
Excuse me. Flight attendant?
The man next to me would appear
to be detonating a bomb.
You think this
looks like a bomb.
Even right now,
I'm not 100% sure
it isn't.
- I think maybe once
people get used to it--
- no.
I was angry.
You were saying things about
the apple ii, and the way
you were treating the team--
woz. You get a free pass
for life.
I got to get back onstage.
We got two minutes
of rehearsal time left.
Do you understand how
condescending that just was?
Maybe you don't.
I don't want to see you
get dragged off an airplane
in plastic handcuffs.
I get a free pass for life
from you?
You give out the pass--
y-y-you give them to me?
You're gonna
have a stroke,
little buddy.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Why has Lisa
not heard of me?
Shit, man,
how many fourth-graders
have heard of you?
You can't write code.
You're not an engineer.
You're not a designer.
You can't put a hammer
to a nail.
I built the circuit board.
The graphical interface
was stolen from xerox parc.
Jef raskin was the leader
of the Mac team before you
threw him off his own project.
Everything--
someone else designed the box.
So how come 10 times
in a day,
I read
"Steve Jobs is a genius"?
What do you do?
I play the orchestra.
And you're a good musician.
You sit right there.
You're the best
in your row.
I came here
to clear the air.
Do you know why I came here?
Didn't you just
answer that?
I came here because
you're gonna get killed.
Your computer's gonna fail.
You had a college
and university advisory board
telling you they need
a powerful workstation
for 2,000 to 3,000.
You've priced next
at 6,500.
And that doesn't include
the optional
$3,000 hard drive,
which people will discover
isn't optional.
Because the optical disk
is too weak to do anything.
And the $2,500 laser printer
brings the total to $12,000.
And in the entire world,
you are the only person
who cares that it's housed
in a perfect cube.
You're gonna get killed.
And I came here
to stand next to you
while that happens
because that's what
friends do.
That's what men do.
I don't need your pass.
We go back,
so don't talk to me
like I'm other people.
I'm the only one
that knows
that this guy here
is someone you invented.
I'm standing by you
because that perfect cube
that does nothing
is about to be the single
biggest failure
in the history
of personal computing.
Tell me something else
i don't know.
Back onstage?
We're out of time.
They've got
to mop the stage
and open the house.
If it crashes,
it crashes, right?
You'll make a joke.
I'll make a joke.
If it crashes,
it crashes.
It's a good slogan.
"Next.
If it crashes, it crashes."
I'm not just talking
about the demo, Steve.
If it tanks, we don't
swallow cyanide.
We go back
to the drawing board.
No more drawing boards.
Invent the edsel twice,
you don't get any more
drawing boards.
Tell me
what the plan is.
You have to tell me
the plan,
because I don't know.
You're walking around
like you've got
"can't lose" cards.
The plan will
reveal itself to you
when you're ready to see it.
Will I have
to drop acid?
Couldn't hurt.
Is there a plan?
Have I ever let you down?
Every single
goddamn time.
Then I'm due.
Is there?
Joanna,
there's a plan.
I just don't wanna put you
in a position where
you're lying to people.
Start 15 minutes late
so avie can recompile and
give us a fighting chance.
Jesus Christ.
How many times
are we gonna have this con--
we're not starting
late, ever!
Fine!
We're not
ever starting late.
Late.
But where
do you come down
on starting late?
Lisa's been doing this thing
where she asks me about stuff
I've already told her.
She asks me questions,
and I know she already
knows the answers.
What's that about?
Kids do that when they're
scared one of their parents
is in a bad mood.
They try to get you talking
about something you like.
It's very common and can be
treated by talking to her
about things she likes.
Do you have any experience
or training in this field?
No.
Tell them
to open the house.
Where's Lisa?
She's around.
- What does that mean?
- She's running around
the building.
An hour ago,
you said you were
taking her to school.
She begged me to let her stay.
There are fathers
who would so love--
it is wrong, okay?
It is morally wrong,
it's parentally wrong.
It is wrong for you
to use Lisa as a way
of getting money from me.
She will know, if she doesn't
already, that that is
your primary use for her.
She will hate you for
the rest of your life.
She will see, if she doesn't
already, that her mother is
a woman who stands up to men.
By living off of them.
By not letting myself
be imprisoned
and degraded by them.
Imprisoned?
I can't get rid of you.
I need a doctor
and I need a dentist.
I dropped out of college
after a semester, but, okay,
let's have a look.
You will support your daughter
and her mother.
Did you pay someone $1,500
to bless your house?
Did you hear
what I said?
Did you?
I don't remember
how much it was, Steve.
- It was $1,500.
- Well, they don't do it
for free.
They don't.
They charge $1,500.
How I spend--
fuck. You know, I'm
not even gonna--
were you about to say,
"how I spend my money
is none of your business"?
I have a sinus infection
and I need
to see a dentist too.
So you can see how
your blessing budget could
have been better spent.
Like on a perfect cube?
- Look at me, chrisann.
- What?
- You know who I am, right?
- Yes.
- And you know I know people.
- What are you talking about?
Look at me. And you know
the people I know,
they know people.
What is this?
If I ever hear again that
you've thrown a cereal bowl
at Lisa's head--
what?
My private line's
gonna ring,
and a voice on the other end
is gonna say,
"we're all set."
That's how I'll learn
that you're dead.
Are you cra--
I threw the bowl
on the floor.
I didn't throw it
at her head.
She wasn't even
in the room.
She was nowhere--
i threw the bowl
on the floor.
She's a little girl.
You're scaring her.
I'm a grown man.
You're scaring me.
Taking out the garbage
is a chore.
Clearing the table
is a chore.
Waking you up
in the morning
is just fucking creepy.
Please teach me more
about being a parent.
We're all done here.
It means so much
coming from someone who
won't admit he is one.
Stop screaming at Lisa.
I give her
responsibilities.
Got it.
One day she's gonna
thank me for it.
Probably
in your sleep.
Fuck off!
Okay.
I never--
i never threw anything
at her head.
Steve.
I never would.
Things don't become so
because you say so.
There'll be more money
in your account
by the end of business.
Were you
being nice?
Oh, yeah.
- Andy's next.
- Hertzfeld
or Cunningham?
Hertzfeld. He's playing
with avie tevanian
on the computer backstage.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the house is now open.
...playing in front
of thousands of people.
Steve!
Can he do it later, Joel?
We go in eight minutes.
Can I get a quick reaction
to the press this morning?
What about it?
The size of it,
the volume.
I'll tell you on background--
I was hoping for
a quote from Steve.
I'll tell you on background
that I've never seen
anything like it
in the tech industry.
I called the<i> wall street journal</i>
to take out a full-page ad
for today,
and do you know
what their sales guy said?
"Why bother?
It'd be like notifying Macy's
that tomorrow is Christmas."
You saw the Stewart alsop
newsletter?
I did.
I'm sorry, Joanna,
i need to get
Steve on the record.
The headline was
"dear next,
when can I get my machine?"
When can he?
We'll announce the ship date
in the next eight to 10 weeks.
Alsop's not talking
about the ship date.
He wants to know
when he can get one
to play with.
We have a lot of respect
for Stewart alsop,
and we want to get a machine
into his hands so he can tell
his subscribers about it.
And when
will that be?
Very soon.
Couple of days?
A week?
Off the record.
Off the record?
Completely.
We think--
he'll get it
when it's finished.
It's not finished?
It's almost
finished.
I've been watching you rehearse
the demo for three weeks.
Yeah.
What's left?
A little thing.
What?
I think
that's enough.
We're off the record,
and Joel's always been good
at understanding nuance.
What's left
to finish?
I guess, in layman's terms,
you'd have to say
we don't have an os.
An operating system?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
- Well, the os is what
runs the computer.
In fact, it sort of
is the computer.
How has it been running?
How's it gonna run
this morning?
What do you mean,
you don't have an os?
It's like this.
Avie tevanian is our
chief software designer,
and he wrote a demo program.
It's like we built a great car,
but we haven't built the engine.
So we put a golf cart battery
in there to make it
go for a bit.
All this computer
knows how to do right now
is demonstrate itself.
You're telling me
the only thing you've built
is a black cube?
Yes. Yeah.
But isn't it the coolest
black cube you've ever seen?
Is this--
we're off the record.
Is this a strategy
or a problem?
If it's a problem--
do not share proprietary
knowledge with that man.
It's not a problem.
I wouldn't
understand it anyway.
I don't understand it either,
and my name's
on the patents.
- It's got e-mail.
- Well, e-mail's not just for
tech specialists anymore.
Well, it is,
but it won't be.
And I assume an e-mail sent
on a next computer can only
be received by a next computer?
Closed, end-to-end.
The new trash can
is wrong.
I wanna tell you
i appreciate all the hours
you put into it,
but I can't
because of how
terrible it is.
Go back to the other one.
Why are we still giving
three options on the clock?
- How many options
do you want to give?
- Two. Buy it or don't.
Can I talk to you
for a second?
Abso-fruitly.
Uh, look, man.
Avie's been recompiling,
but he says there
may be some glitches
this morning.
If all there are
are some glitches,
it'll be a triumph
of miraculous magnitude.
Why are you translating
for avie?
I-i didn't want him to find out
the hard way your position
on glitches in a demo,
but it sounds like
you've mellowed.
I've been growing, Andy.
I've been learning
to love myself.
Hmm. I wouldn't
have ever dreamed
that was a problem.
Fantastic burn.
You need to go
to your seat.
How about Lisa,
getting into a school
for gifted kids?
Yeah, she was tested
and it turns out
she can fly.
- Seriously, it's a big deal.
- I know it's a big deal.
That's why I built
the school a building.
Well, I'm sure that's
not why she got in.
Really?
Uh, can I show you
something funny
from<i> macworld?</i>
I can't think of anything
i have to do right now.
It'll make you feel good.
Joanna! Look at this!
Oh, Andy, he's only got
a couple of minutes.
It's guy kawasaki
writing in<i> macworld.</i>
You're gonna like this.
Well, can we all
enjoy it later?
He wrote a parody press release
about apple buying next
for your os.
He imagines a near future
where apple needs your os
and has to buy next,
and-and you come back
as ceo.
He has gates saying,
"there would now be more
innovations from jobs
that Microsoft could copy."
You can read it later.
Thanks.
She would've gotten in
without you
donating a building.
Still, it's something
to talk about
in the interview.
All right.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Give that to me.
I'll throw it out
for you.
I'm gonna hang on to it.
What?
What?
You ready for sculley?
Excuse me!
Lisa!
You can't shout!
Lisa?
You have to go.
It's dangerous up here.
That's why I make
other people do it.
Who are you hiding from,
me or your mom?
I'm not hiding.
Let's go.
What were you listening to?
I'm listening
to two versions
of the same song.
Then when I get to the ends,
i rewind to listen
to them again.
It's the same song,
but the versions
are different.
What's the song?
Okay.
So it's a really old song,
and it's called
"both sides, now."
"Both sides, now"?
Yeah.
What's it about?
It's about--
there are three verses:
Clouds, love and life.
And the person singing
is singing that they used
to think of--
that they used
to think about--
clouds,
love and life?
Right.
One way, yeah,
but now they look at them
another way, and they--
they've come to the conclusion
that they really don't know
clouds, love or life at all.
Those are
the exact words.
Yeah, joni Mitchell.
'Cause it's not
a really old song,
unless I'm a really old guy.
You have to go
to school now.
Do you want me to tell you
the differences between
the two versions?
Right now.
The first version
is the kind of thing
that you would call girlish.
I didn't mean
i want to know
the difference right now.
I meant you have to go
to school right now.
I can stay and watch.
You are truant.
You're committing a crime.
I'm not gonna miss
anything important.
How do you know?
I read ahead.
The pilgrims make it
to the new world.
Then the declaration
of independence.
Yeah, you skipped
a couple centuries.
Steve?
Chrisann's out there.
Let's go.
Can I make my case
for staying?
Nope.
She was with me.
Come on. Your dad
doesn't want us to stay.
That's not true.
That's not--
you have to be in school
is all.
I'm committing a crime
right now, and I don't wanna
get in trouble.
You're not in trouble.
I was kidding.
Okay.
Hey. What was
the second version?
You said the first version
was girlish.
What was the second version?
I can't really
think of the word.
Okay. Well,
have a good day at school.
Regretful.
What?
Like wishing you
could go back
and do things different.
You're too young
to be regretful.
Not me.
The person
singing the song.
Got it. Regretful.
That makes sense
because--
I wanna live with you.
Six minutes.
- You want to see sculley?
- No.
You know all those times
i told you
you needed security?
Here's why.
I don't know how it is
I've gotten older
and you haven't.
Some deal with the devil
i was never offered.
So you know
what I've been thinking
for the last four years?
As it turns out,
John, I've never known
what you were thinking.
No newborn baby
has control.
Do you know
what I'm talking about?
In '84, before the Mac launch.
You said--
yeah.
You said that being adopted
meant you didn't have control.
We're starting
in a minute, so--
why do people think
i fired you?
It's fine, John.
It's all behind us.
Is it? Hmm?
Don't play stupid.
You can't pull it off.
You came here to ask me
why people think
you fired me?
Why do people think
i fired you?
Just confirm something
for me, okay?
You liked the ad,
right?
The commercial-- "1984."
You liked it.
When are you
gonna get furniture?
It's not an easy process.
It is. You buy a couch,
take it from there.
I'd be really surprised
if you came here to talk
about interior decorating.
I liked the ad very much.
You did?
You know I did.
You're a lying
son of a bitch.
You tried to kill it.
- It's time to take
a hard look at the Mac.
- It's past time.
It's overpriced.
We need to drop it
to 1,995.
We need to double
the marketing budget,
put more bodies
on an internal hard drive
and invest in fileserver.
- Where the hell did you get
the idea I tried to kill--
- Lee clow.
Lee's wrong.
He's lying?
- He's... mistaken.
Where would
the money come from?
It would come from finally
getting rid of the apple ii.
The apple ii is
the only thing making money.
- You agreed with the board.
- I understood
the board's concerns, but i--
the board's concerns that
we didn't show the product?
Among other things,
but my question was--
what other things?
I'm asking because I'm curious.
You said "among other things."
Among other things, it was set
in a dystopian galaxy.
It took place on a planet
where we don't live.
It was dark
and the opposite of our brand.
<i>And</i> we didn't show the product.
People talked about the ad
but most of them didn't know
what we were selling.
The Mac needs to sell
for 1,995.
There is no market research
telling us the Mac is failing
because it's overpriced.
It's telling us that people
don't like it because they think
it doesn't do anything.
It's closed, end-to-end.
We didn't know it wasn't
what people wanted,
but it isn't.
They want slots,
they want choices,
they want options.
The way we buy stereos--
mix and match components.
John, listen to me.
Whoever said the customer
is always right
was, I promise you,
a customer.
It had skinheads in it.
She was liberating them.
- Liberating the skinheads.
- The ad didn't have anything
to do with fucking skinheads.
We used them
as fucking extras.
Nobody even knows
they were skinheads.
I'm just saying
the board had concerns--
you invented
lifestyle advertising.
And our brand
was my brand.
My job is to make
a recommendation
to the board.
We showed a lot of happy people
drinking Pepsi.
We didn't say
the world was going to end
if you bought a Dr. pepper.
Recommend that we drop the price
and double the marketing budget.
- I can't.
-<i> And</i> we showed the product.
We showed it being opened,
we showed it being poured,
being consumed.
What are you gonna do,
recommend that we kill the Mac?
I already have, Steve.
What? When?
You think the secret
to your success
was not assuming
people knew what to do
with a can of soda?
I didn't kill the ad, Steve!
I'm the only reason
it made it on the air.
Just now.
An hour ago.
I'm coming from
markkula's house.
What did he say?
What did he say?
Invent something new.
I'll give you a team.
You can sit in Maui.
The resorts
come with couches.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying you recommended
terminating the Mac
or you recommended
taking me off the Mac team?
We bought three spots
in the super bowl.
Two 30's and a 60.
After we screened it,
the board wanted that money back
and they asked me
to sell off the spots.
Chiat/day sold off the two 30's
but not the 60,
and I let it be known
to Lee clow
that if he didn't
try very hard
to sell the last spot,
I wouldn't be unhappy.
If we drop the price
and double the budget--
drop the price
or double the budget.
The only way to do that
is to take money
out of the apple ii.
The apple ii
should embarrass you.
It embarrasses me.
It doesn't embarrass
the shareholders.
I don't give a shit
about the shareholders.
That's why I hired you,
so I don't have to hear
about shareholders.
The shareholders are
my problem, and the board
represents the shareholders.
That's how it works.
You sure it wasn't Lee clow
who dragged his feet
selling the 60?
At my direction, Steve.
You think he would have
done that on his own,
taken it on himself?
Yeah. I think he would've
done what it took
to save it from you.
I was the only thing
protecting it.
You didn't want the ad
because you were trying
to kill the Mac two months
before it launched.
You are fucking delusional.
Can I mention something
to you?
Sure.
I have no earthly idea
why you're here.
The story of why and how
you left apple,
which is quickly
becoming mythologized,
isn't true.
- I'm gonna take this
to the board myself.
- Don't do that.
I<i> am</i> doing that.
You can't.
Why?
They believe
you're no longer necessary
to this company.
I get hate mail,
death threats.
I get death threats.
My kids are getting taunted.
Why do people think I fired you?
Joanna's gonna call my name
in a second.
- Steve?
- That was unrehearsed.
Yeah, I'll be there
in just a second.
I gave you
your day in court.
- You gave me?
- I gave the board
a clear choice.
I said, "do you want to invest
in the apple ii or the Mac?"
They chose the apple ii.
The same people who wanted
to dump the super bowl spot.
And then I got
on a plane to China.
Mr. sculley.
There's a call for you
on line one.
Or I almost got on a plane,
because I got a call
in the lounge.
- Who made that call?
- Doesn't matter.
<i>It matters to me.</i>
<i>Who made the call?</i>
John sculley.
<i>John?</i>
<i> If you get on that plane,</i>
<i> you'll have lost your job</i>
<i> by the time it lands.</i>
<i>Steve's been calling the board.</i>
<i>He wants you out.</i>
<i>I left my bags</i>
<i>on the plane. My shit's</i>
<i>still somewhere in Beijing.</i>
I took a car back
to cupertino in the middle
of the fucking night.
I know what time it is.
I need a quorum here in one hour
and I want Steve here too.
<i>You took me off the Mac,</i>
<i>and it was bad business.</i>
The quorum call was a homicide.
Right there!
Right there.
That's the part
that's bullshit,
my friend.
It was a suicide.
Because you knew your cards
and I showed you mine.
I showed you mine,
and you did it anyway.
What did you think
i was gonna do?
I'm okay losing,
but I'm not gonna forfeit.
I'm not okay losing.
<i>We're losing market share,</i>
<i>and the Mac is losing money.</i>
Our only hope is the apple ii,
which is stagnating because
of its soon-to-be-obsolete dos.
Users are already rigging
their machines to run with
a cp/m operating system
that's been built
to run on intel.
I can't put it
more simply than this.
We need to put our resources
into updating the apple ii.
<i>By taking resources</i>
<i>from the Mac.</i>
<i>It's failing.</i>
<i>That's a fact.</i>
It's overpriced.
There's no evidence
that it's--
I'm the evidence!
I'm the world's leading expert
on the Mac, John.
What's your rsum?
You're issuing
contradictory instructions,
you're insubordinate,
you make people miserable.
Our top engineers
are fleeing to sun, Dell, HP.
<i>Wall street doesn't know</i>
<i>who's driving the bus.</i>
We've lost hundreds
of millions in value.
And I'm the ceo of apple, Steve.
That's my rsum.
But before that,
you sold carbonated
sugar water, right?
I sat in a fucking garage
with wozniak
and invented the future.
Because artists lead
and hacks ask
for a show of hands.
All right.
Well, this guy's
out of control.
I'm perfectly willing
to hand in
my resignation tonight,
but if you want me to stay,
you can't have Steve.
Settle him out.
He can keep a share of stock
so he gets our newsletter.
<i>He'll have to sever</i>
<i>his connection to apple.</i>
I'm dead serious.
I want the secretary
to call for a vote.
I fucking dare you.
You have done an outstanding job
over the years
of cultivating the press.
And by that,
i mean manipulating them.
Because none of them,
none of their editors, none of
their editors' publishers
to this day
know that you forced it,
<i>that you forced the board.</i>
<i>Even after I told you</i>
<i>exactly what they'd do,</i>
which is exactly
what they did.
Unanimously.
I don't have any trouble
remembering that, John,
because of it being
the worst night of my life.
And I forced the vote
because I believed I was right.
- I still believe I'm right.
- And I'm right.
Now I bled that night.
<i>And I don't bleed.</i>
<i>But time's done its thing,</i>
<i>and I really haven't</i>
<i>thought about it in a while.</i>
Now, I absolutely understand
why you're upset.
<i>And I want people</i>
<i>to know the truth too.</i>
It's time.
Got it.
You're gonna end me,
aren't you?
You're being ridiculous.
I'm gonna sit center court
and watch you do it yourself.
Then I'm gonna order a nice meal
with a '55 margaux
and sign some autographs.
Jesus Christ.
You want some advice,
Pepsi generation?
Don't send woz out
to slap me around in the press.
Anybody else--
you, markkula, Arthur rock.
Anyone but rain man.
Don't manipulate him like that.
Whatever you may think,
I'm always gonna protect him.
Come on, Steve.
That's what men do.
We can't start late.
I don't think there was any way
to detect a chip on my shoulder.
Did you know, back at bandley,
the Mac team gave an award
every year to the person
who could stand up to you?
No.
I won.
Three years in a row.
Cool.
This.
This--
this guy kawasaki in<i> macworld.</i>
He accidentally got it right,
didn't he?
You've been dragging your feet
on the next os
till you can figure out
what apple's gonna need.
Even if that were true,
it doesn't sound
that diabolical to me.
Hey. We're ready for you.
I'm your closest confidante,
your-- your best friend.
Your thing--
what do you call it?
Your work wife.
The whole time.
The last three years.
When did you change your mind
and start building
the Steve Jobs revenge machine?
- House to half.
You remember skylab?
It was an unmanned satellite
NASA sent up in the early '70s
on a data gathering mission.
The thing is,
when they sent it up,
they didn't know yet
how they were gonna
get it back.
But they felt like
they were close enough
<i>that in the eight years</i>
<i>it was gonna be up there,</i>
<i>they'd figure it out.</i>
They're on their way now.
They didn't.
So after eight years,
it came crashing down
in a thousand-mile swath
across the Indian ocean.
<i>A little to the left,</i>
<i>a little to the right,</i>
<i>somebody could have</i>
<i>gotten hurt.</i>
I really wanted to build
a computer for colleges.
The technology
just didn't catch up
as fast as I needed it to.
<i>You know we're out of money.</i>
<i>Ladies</i>
<i>and gentlemen, the program</i>
<i>will be starting momentarily.</i>
<i>But then apple</i>
<i> stopped innovating,</i>
<i> and I saw something better.</i>
Joanna, I know schools
aren't gonna buy a $13,000
dictionary with good speakers.
You know I know that.
But apple will.
'Cause avie tevanian
is gonna build them
exactly the os they need.
<i>They're gonna</i>
<i>have to buy me too.</i>
For half a billion dollars
in stock and end-to-end control
on every product.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome--
<i>more than</i>
<i>a year after it was first</i>
<i>unveiled to industry insiders,</i>
<i>the next computer</i>
<i>is finally available in stores.</i>
<i>And it appears to be two strikes</i>
<i>in a row for Steve Jobs.</i>
<i>Students and educators</i>
<i>are finding it</i>
<i>difficult to justify</i>
<i>the machine's high cost.</i>
<i>So much for the black cube.</i>
<i>Next just sold</i>
<i>its factory to canon</i>
<i>and laid off half its employees.</i>
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.
Apple computer
has fallen on hard times.
It is laying off
about 2,500 people.
<i>Apple is continuing</i>
<i>to lose market share,</i>
<i>with no new innovations</i>
<i>in the pipeline</i>
<i>except the Newton,</i>
<i>a pet project</i>
<i>of ceo John sculley.</i>
<i>If you really want to be mobile,</i>
<i>you want a Newton PDA.</i>
<i>But then again,</i>
<i>maybe you don't.</i>
<i>It turns handwriting</i>
<i>into computer text.</i>
Hey, dolph,
take a memo on your Newton.
"Beat up Martin."
- Bah!
<i>In 1980,</i>
<i>apple had 30% of the market.</i>
<i>Today, apple has</i>
<i>only 3.2 percent.</i>
<i>That's it. John sculley</i>
<i>has been fired from apple.</i>
- What about this Internet thing?
- Do you know anything about that?
It is the big new thing.
Rumors are flying
around apple computer
once again
over who will take over
the helm.
In the news at this hour,
a remarkable high-tech reunion.
<i>Well, it's happening.</i>
<i>In a billion-dollar shakeup,</i>
<i>apple is purchasing</i>
<i>next computer's operating</i>
<i>system, which may mean--</i>
<i>is the prodigal son returning?</i>
<i>Bet on it.</i>
Guess what.
Mac is back.
- Apple cofounder Steven jobs--
- Steve Jobs--
- Steve Jobs--
- Steve Jobs--
- Steve Jobs--
<i>Steve Jobs</i>
<i>is returning to apple.</i>
<i>If you want to beam</i>
<i>your digital photographs</i>
<i>from your digital camera,</i>
<i>it's built into every product.</i>
<i>We're going to</i>
<i>the new generation of i/o.</i>
Twelve megabyte USB.
Two ports.
We're leaving
the old apple i/o behind.
Stereo surround sound
built into every product,
a great keyboard
and the coolest mouse
you've ever seen.
This time,
we used actual mice.
We're opening the house
in 10 minutes. Steven?
Do you want to stop
horsing around?
Bless my eyes.
That's Steve wozniak
sitting out there.
Give yourselves a treat
and ask woz if he happens
to have the correct time.
I have the correct time,
and we're running out of it.
"A great keyboard"--
a great keyboard and the coolest
mouse you've ever seen.
- This is what those things
look like today.
Now, I'd like to show you
what they're gonna
look like tomorrow.
This is the iMac.
Why did I like that better
than I usually do?
- I don't know.
- Something was different.
Hey, stupid.
I think she's talking to
one of you guys.
- Did you notice a difference?
- That's what I'm--
the exit signs were off.
Full blackout.
You did it.
We wired all the exit lights
to our board.
They go out with the cue
for seven seconds then come
back on again. In theory.
- We think that's legal?
- No, we're very certain
it's not.
- You want to see some quotes?
- Let's hold off on those.
- No, he'll like 'em.
- I'll show 'em to you later.
- I'll take 'em now.
- I'm sorry.
- Pick it up from there, please.
We only have
a couple of minutes,
so let's just do the 360.
We're gonna bring out
a wireless camera
we stole from panasonic.
I'll show you
what this looks like.
The whole thing
is translucent.
You can see into it.
How's that
for a compromise, woz?
You still can't get into it,
but you can see into it.
Fair enough.
We put stereo speakers in front,
infrared right up here,
cd-rom drive in the middle.
Nice.
Dual stereo headphone Jacks.
All the connectors are inside
one beautiful little door here.
Ethernet. USB.
Even though this is
a full-blooded macintosh,
we're targeting it
for the number one use
the consumers tell us
they want a computer for,
which is--
let's hold it, please.
Hold it.
The answer was
"the Internet."
Joanna?
Yeah.
Stand in front of me.
I want to look at these quotes,
but I don't want Joel to know.
They're all great.
"It is not only the
coolest-looking computer
introduced in years
but a chest-thumping
statement
that silicon valley's
original dream company
is no longer somnambulant."
It's a word.
It means "sleepwalking."
Steve? I'm sorry. We have
to clear the house if
we're gonna start on time.
We're gonna start on time.
We're absolutely
starting on time.
Here. Take this.
Everybody, that's it.
They've got to mop the stage,
reset and open the house.
I love you guys.
Andy, come on back a minute.
- Which one?
- Hertzfeld.
<i>Forbes</i> calls it
an "industry-altering success."
Look here.
Why haven't we
ever slept together?
We're not in love.
Look.
Sculley.
Look what he said.
"He has implemented the same
simple strategy that made apple
so successful 15 years ago--
make hit products
and promote them
with terrific marketing."
It was nice of him.
It was.
I meant it.
Sightings of j.D. Salinger
are more common
than John sculley.
I wasn't being sarcastic.
It was nice of him.
Do you talk to him?
No.
You haven't
talked to him
since '88?
I'd have told you if I did.
Doesn't matter.
I don't want people
thinking they can cross me
and then, boom, 15 years later,
I'm cool with it.
I was kidding.
What's wrong with you
this morning?
Let's get off the stage.
"The only thing
apple's providing now
is leadership in colors."
Don't worry about it.
What does Bill Gates
have against me?
I don't know.
You're both
out of your minds.
Listen to me.
He dropped out
of a better school
than I dropped out of.
But he's a tool bag.
I'll tell you why.
Make everything
all right with Lisa.
You know, Joanna?
Boundaries.
You've come to
my apartment at 1:00 am
and cleaned it.
So tell me
where the boundary is.
There.
Let's say it's there.
If I give you
some real projections,
will you promise
not to repeat them
from the stage?
What do you mean,
"real projections"?
What have you been giving me?
Conservative projections.
Marketing's been lying to me?
We've been managing expectations
so that you don't not.
What are the real projections?
We're gonna sell
a million units
in the first 90 days.
20,000 a month after that.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
You see?
You wait long enough and--
what's more,
32% of the sales
are going to go to people
buying a computer
for the first time.
And 12% are going to people
using some kind
of windows machine.
That's what Bill Gates
has against you.
And it'll be
the fastest-selling computer
in history.
You brought the company back
from life support
after going through
the misery of laying off
3,000 people
and cutting 70%
of the product line.
So, Steven, it's over.
You're gonna win.
- It would be criminal
not to enjoy this moment.
- I'm enjoying it.
Make things all right
with Lisa.
You know--
come on.
I don't like having less privacy
than other people have.
Does being a multi-billionaire
take some of the sting off that?
No.
All Lisa did--
all Lisa did
was give her blessing.
Chrisann sold the house and--
and Lisa could have done what?
How was she supposed
to stop her mother
from selling her own house?
That I bought
for the two of them.
How was she supposed
to stop her?
Voicing an objection
would have been a step
in the right direction.
You don't think
you're having
a bizarre overreaction
to a 19-year-old girl
allowing her mother
to list her own house?
She could've tried.
Was she supposed
to stop her mother,
that particular mother--
she gave chrisann
her blessing to sell the house
and she did it to spite me.
I don't care
if she put a pipe bomb
in the water heater.
You're going to fix it, now.
She's been acting weird
for months.
She's turned on me.
Fix it.
What the--
fix it, Steve.
Take it easy.
Fix it or I quit.
How about that?
I quit, and you
never see me again.
How about that?
Tell me what's wrong with you
this morning.
What's been wrong with me
for 19 years.
I've been a witness,
and I tell you,
I've been complicit.
I love you, Steve.
You know how much.
I love that you don't care
how much money a person makes.
You care<i> what</i> they make.
But what you make
isn't supposed to be
the best part of you.
When you're a father,
that's what's supposed to be
the best part of you.
And it's caused me
two decades of agony, Steve,
that it is for you
the worst.
It's a little thing.
It's a very small thing.
Fix it.
Fix it now, or you can
contact me at my new job--
working anywhere I want.
I don't happen to think
it is a little deal.
She knew that--
- no.
- I bought the house
for the two of--
- no.
- What do you mean, "no"?
I mean no. The house
has nothing to do with
why you're angry at Lisa.
I assure you, the house
has everything to do with
why I'm angry at Lisa.
Have you ever heard the phrase
"reality distortion field"?
- Yes.
- As in "Steve's reality
distortion field"?
I've heard it. I've read it.
It's been sung to me
by Joan baez.
What you call
a reality distortion field,
and I'm pretty sure
you're the one
who coined the phrase,
is the reason we're here.
I know that.
If I traded in
my bank account for a dollar
every time somebody told me
something was impossible,
I'd come out ahead.
I know that too.
What's the problem?
My problem?
It sure isn't the house.
Jo, i--
it's that you told her
you weren't going to pay
for Harvard.
That child.
That earnest, unironic kid.
She told you
i wasn't paying her tuition?
I should have
hit you with something heavy
a long time ago.
Lisa told you
i wasn't paying
her tuition?
Andy told me that.
Which one?
Hertzfeld.
How would hertzfeld know?
He wrote Harvard
a check for 25,000
to cover the semester.
Are you fucking--
he paid her tuition?
Isn't that why
you just asked to see him?
No, I asked to see him
about something--
did you tell her you weren't
going to pay for college?
Yes, because--
how could you do that?
Because her mother,
who is also her landlord--
hertzfeld? I was ranting.
I was just, you know--
i was talking.
You think I would--
I was pissed off
because Lisa was trying
to piss me off, Joanna.
That was her intent.
I don't know--
you obviously
scared the hell out of her.
Hertzfeld wrote
a check to Harvard,
pay for--
is she here yet?
I'm sure she is.
Can you have someone
bring her back?
Yes.
Thank you.
You know,
my grandmother
always used to say to me--
I don't give a shit, yentl.
I'll have someone get Lisa.
Thank you.
- And if you see hertzfeld--
it's Andy.
Speak of the devil's
chief engineer.
Go.
Come on in.
You look great today.
Thank you.
Doesn't she?
She looks fantastic.
Always does.
Get out.
- Well, I think I know
why I'm here.
- Do you?
Steve--
did you send the check yet?
Yes.
So Harvard got a tuition check
from Andy hertzfeld
to pay for Lisa?
I don't think
they look that carefully.
I don't think they'd notice
the check didn't come from you.
Close one. This was almost
embarrassing for me.
I understand how--
I'll wire you
the money today.
I-i understand how you feel.
And I do apologize. I do.
But let me tell you
my thinking.
I can't even think of
an appropriate analogy
to describe what you did.
I knew you guys
would fix things.
You always do.
But in the meantime,
if the money wasn't there,
she'd miss a semester of school.
Yeah.
And she'd have to
tell her friends why.
And she needed things.
She needed socks.
What?
It's cold in Cambridge.
She needed warm socks.
You gave her socks?
Well, I gave her money
for socks.
You don't get
to deputize yourself
as her interim.
You don't get to override
my decisions.
Do you understand?
You don't get to act
like you're her father.
Somebody had to.
What the fuck
did you just say to me?
I've known her
since she was six.
I also consider--
chrisann's my friend,
outside of what you and i--
outside of our relationship.
So you're like
a family adviser.
I'm a family friend.
Then you probably know
that Lisa's been seeing
a therapist.
Yeah.
For many years.
Yeah.
Without my knowledge.
That really wasn't my business.
I'm fascinated
by what you think is
and isn't your business.
Lisa's been going
to a therapist
and she likes it
and would love
for you and chrisann
to go with her.
And the reason you know that
is because you're the one
that recommended the therapist.
Well, I know a guy.
No, I mean you're the one
who recommended
that she see a therapist.
You know what? It was
a while ago, and I don't
remember how the whole--
you told chrisann
that Lisa should see
a therapist.
Steve, you're stigmatizing.
It's a perfectly norm--
it's not--
my thing was, how can it hurt?
Let's find out.
Chrisann is my friend.
What was the reason
you gave?
You mean--
what was the reason
you gave chrisann why Lisa
should see a therapist?
I don't remember.
We were talking and I said--
it's pretty much
what I just said,
that it certainly couldn't hurt.
You didn't say
that Lisa needed
a strong male role model?
I did.
I think it's a miracle
she's not robbing banks with
the symbionese liberation army.
There's no reason in the world
why she should be nice.
But she is.
So I helped,
because somebody had to.
I'll wire the money to you
this afternoon.
You threatened me
a long time ago.
Sorry?
A long time ago--
you threatened me once.
People are attracted
to people with talent.
People without it
find that threatening.
Maybe you should
see a therapist.
Certainly couldn't hurt.
I meant you literally
threatened me.
At flint, right before
the Mac launch.
I was recompiling.
I was trying to debug
the voice demo.
You said if I couldn't find
a solution, you'd call me out
in front of the audience.
- Did it say "hello"?
- It did.
No need to thank me.
Why do you want people
to dislike you?
I don't want people
to dislike me.
I'm indifferent
to whether they dislike me.
Since it doesn't matter,
i always have.
Really?
I've always liked you a lot.
That's too bad.
Knock 'em dead.
Thank you.
What is remarkable,
what's hard to fathom but true,
is that for a given clock rate,
a powerpc chip is twice as fast
as a pentium ii chip.
In other words,
a 266 megahertz g3 chip
is twice as fast as
a 266 megahertz pentium ii.
Or... a 266 g3
is equal to about 500 megahertz.
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>a coincidence is, Lisa?</i>
Take a look at
<i>byte</i> magazine's byte marks,
the gold standard for any--
- come in.
I sent someone into the lobby.
They found her, and she--
where is she?
She said
she'd rather not come back.
- Why?
- That was it.
- I'm going out there myself.
- You can't. You can't.
It'll be a scene
out of<i> hard day's night.</i>
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Joel.
Andy said
it was okay to come back.
- Which one?
- Andy Cunningham.
I can't do this forever.
I need one of them
to change their name.
You call Andy Cunningham
"Andrea."
It doesn't matter
what I call them.
I know who I'm talking about
when I'm talking.
I need everyone else to
call them different names.
Give me one second.
Can you go
get her for me, please?
I just talked to Andy.
Hertzfeld.
I'm just trying to scrub this
out of my brain with drano.
But I do want to talk to Lisa.
Okay. Just--
stay cool.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hey, Steve.
How are you feeling?
I'm feeling good, Joel.
How about you?
I don't think I could be
in your business.
It changes too quickly.
Well, I'd hang on,
'cause yours is about to start
changing pretty quickly too.
This is the third time
in 14 years
I'm writing about you.
What do you think so far?
Excuse me.
Avie's looking for you.
He has a new shark.
You wanna come backstage
for a second?
Sure.
Who's this one?
Alan turing.
Single-handedly won world war ii
and, for an encore,
invented the computer.
He won't be part of
the campaign though.
Why not?
'Cause you just had
to ask me who he was.
Can I see new shark?
I like it better than
the old shark.
Sharks.
Sharks.
How many sharks
did you go through?
A couple.
This is the 39th.
We're on the record.
Thirty-nine sharks.
Okay.
You know what's special
about this shark?
What?
No, I'm really asking,
because it looks exactly like
the other 38 sharks to me.
Let me see it with the cue,
from the profile.
This is cue 92-b.
This is a profile here,
and this is what it looks like
from the back.
And one more thing.
It eats pentium notebooks
as a light snack.
This is the shark.
I really like it.
Nobody gets it right
the first time,
but I should have been shown
this shark 15, 20 fish ago.
- You probably were.
- Lock it in.
Ten minutes.
He killed himself by taking
a bite of a poison apple--
Alan turing.
Yeah.
There should be statues
of that man.
His name should be on the lips
of schoolchildren.
The rainbow flag apple
with a bite taken out--
that's where it came from?
No, we picked it off a list
of friendly-sounding words.
But wouldn't it be great
if that had been
the story behind it?
Steve.
Kinda liked the last shark.
Fuck you.
I wanted to ask you a favor.
My friend, a long time ago,
you asked me a favor
before a product launch,
and I said no.
- You wanted me to acknowledge--
- hang on.
If you're about to say
you were wrong, I want
to prepare this journalist.
I was 100% right,
and you were
spectacularly wrong.
But I still owe you a favor,
so name it.
Steve--
- it can't be acknowledging
the apple ii team.
- Acknowledge the apple ii team.
- How about in private?
- No.
- Is this a prank?
- No.
I'm trying to remember that
a 300 megahertz g3 chip--
just the top guys.
Steve.
- Excuse me, okay?
- Yep.
One second.
She said she'd rather not.
What do you mean?
She's sitting with her friends,
and she said
she'd rather not come back.
Okay. Tell her--
take her aside.
I don't want
to embarrass her
in front of her friends.
But tell her I just scared
the shit out of Andy,
and this time, nobody's
paying her fucking--
all right.
Don't say that.
But do your thing
where you sound old and wise
because of the broad,
tragic European canvas
of your life.
You know I wasn't born
in a 19th-century shtetl, right?
Please tell her
it's important.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.
- There are people
around here, man--
- I know.
- Including a member
of the press.
- I see him.
Woz.
Just the top guys, the ones
who are getting laid off.
Listen, okay?
Last year, apple lost
one billion dollars.
I don't even know
how that's possible.
You were less than 90 days
from being insolvent.
I had
three different accountants
try to explain it to me.
The whole place
has to be streamlined.
- Start with
two of the accountants.
- I started with the--
- Joel, could you come offstage?
We're gonna go backstage.
- Leave him right there.
I started with the apple ii team
because we don't
make that anymore.
- Just acknowledge the top guys.
- Have a mimosa and relax.
You will not blow me off
right now, Steve.
- The top guys deserve--
- there are no top guys.
All right?
On the apple ii team,
there are no top guys.
They're "b" players,
and "b" players
discourage the "a" players.
I want "a" players at apple
and not Dell.
They're not "b" players,
and I'm a better judge of that.
Less than 90 days
from insolvency,
in part because somebody
thought the Newton
wasn't a box of garbage.
Joel, could you come
offstage, please?
Leave him.
I'm talking about--
you guys designed and shipped
a little box of garbage
while I was gone.
I'm talking about the apple ii,
which is not just a crucial part
of this company's history,
it is a crucial part of the
history of personal computing.
For a time.
The least you can do, if you're
going to downsize these people--
they're gonna live
in the biggest houses of
anyone on the unemployment line.
Is to acknowledge them.
Acknowledge them and
the apple ii during this launch.
This is a new animal.
This whole place was built
by the apple ii.
<i>You</i> were built by the apple ii.
As a matter of fact, I was
destroyed by the apple ii
and its open system
so that hackers
and hobbyists
could build ham radios
or something.
And then it nearly
destroyed apple
when you spent
all your money on it
and developed a grand total
of no new products.
- The Newton.
- The little box of garbage.
You guys came up
with the Newton. You want
people to know that?
This is a product launch,
not a luncheon.
The last thing I want to do
is connect the iMac to--
to the only successful product
that this company has ever made.
I'm sorry to be blunt,
but that happens
to be the truth.
The Lisa was a failure.
The macintosh was a failure.
I don't like
talking like this,
but I am tired of being Ringo
when I know I was John.
Everybody loves Ringo.
And I'm tired of
being patronized by you.
You think John became John
by winning a raffle, woz?
You think
he tricked somebody
or hit George Harrison
over the head?
He was John
because he was John.
He was John 'cause
he wrote "ticket to ride."
And I wrote the apple ii.
- Everybody? I want to
clear the auditorium.
- Nobody moves.
You made a beautiful board,
which, by the way,
you were willing
to give out for free,
so don't tell me
how you built apple.
If it weren't for me,
you'd be the easiest "a"
at homestead high school.
These people live and die
by your praise,
so here's your chance.
Acknowledge that
something good happened that
you weren't in the room for.
No.
Steve.
Do it. It's right. It's--
it's right.
Sorry, but no.
Then let me put it another way.
I don't think there's a man
who's done more to advance
the democratization that comes
with personal computing
than I have,
but you've never had
any respect for me.
Now why is that?
I'd at least consider
the possibility
that it's because
you've never had any for me.
What the hell is going on here?
Nothing.
Thank you for your time.
It's done.
She's coming back.
You came a half-inch
from putting this company
out of business.
Now who do I see about that?
I'm letting you keep your job.
You get a pass.
You know, when people
used to ask me
what the difference was
between me and Steve Jobs,
I would say Steve
was the big-picture guy
and I liked a solid workbench.
When people ask me
what the difference is now,
I say "Steve's an asshole."
Your products are better
than you are, brother.
That's the idea, brother.
And knowing that,
that's the difference.
It's not binary.
You can be decent and gifted
at the same time.
He didn't mean it.
Yeah, he did.
He's a temperamental guy.
No, he's not.
It's like five minutes
before every launch,
everyone goes to a bar,
gets drunk and tells me
what they really think.
She's coming
to your dressing room.
I told you to make things
all right with Lisa.
I didn't say you had to settle
every blood feud you have.
Last time blood feuds
weren't settled,
i lost the cover of<i> time.</i>
Though for the life of me,
i still don't know what the hell
Dan kottke was mad at me about.
Kottke didn't lose you
the cover of<i> time.</i>
Of course he did.
Would you like me
to demonstrate
your capacity to be wrong
when you're certain
you're right?
Dan kottke told<i> time</i> magazine
that I was denying--
do you remember
the cover?
Of<i> time?</i>
Yes.
Yes.
What was it?
What are you talking about?
What was on the cover?
A computer.
No.
It was a sculpture
of a computer.
It was a sculpture.
<i> Time</i> would have had
to have commissioned it
months in advance.
You were never
in the conversation
for man of the year.
Nobody lost you anything.
<i>...picture of me and the Mac.</i>
So what else
are you sure about?
I don't know how
i could've missed that.
Reality distortion.
No, seriously.
Seriously.
Don't try to win
an argument with Lisa.
Just say you were wrong.
Come on in, honey.
- It's not "honey."
- John.
Get in. Get in.
Get out of the hall.
I was taken in
a side entrance.
I'll go out the same way.
No one will see me.
How are you, Joanna?
I'm good, John.
I'm just surprised
to see you.
Everyone here really appreciates
the quote you gave to<i> Forbes.</i>
You didn't
have to do that.
My pleasure.
If you want,
i can slip you in the back
once the house lights go out.
I'm just here
to say "good luck."
-<i> Okay.</i>
You just have
a couple of minutes.
Would you try to find--
yeah.
You're a good man, John.
So I brought you a present.
A Newton.
Don't take it out of the box,
you'll be able to sell it,
which is more than I can say.
Everything all right there?
Uh, no--
just something
Joanna pointed out to me.
I missed something
so obvious about--
doesn't matter.
Look, wall street's
gonna sit back and wait to see
how you do as ceo,
so don't let
any fluctuation bother you
for the first 12 months.
Day traders are gonna respond.
I don't need to school you.
This your way
of telling me I shouldn't
have killed the Newton?
The most efficient animal
on the planet is the condor.
The most inefficient animals
on the planet are humans.
Well, you shouldn't have
killed it for spite.
That's bad business.
Don't do that.
But a human
with a bicycle becomes
the most efficient animal.
And the right computer--
a friendly, easy computer
that isn't an eyesore
but rather sits on your desk
with the beauty
of a tensor lamp--
the right computer
will be a bicycle for the mind.
Do you like it?
I was giving back.
And what if instead of it
being in the right hands,
it was in everyone's hands?
Everyone in the world.
We'd be talking about
the most tectonic shift
in the status quo since--
ever.
I don't know why you've
always been interested
in my adoption history,
but you said it's not like
someone looked at me
and gave me back.
But that is what happened.
And you're telling me
you have the right computer.
It's called macintosh.
A lawyer couple
adopted me first,
then gave me back
after a month.
They changed their mind.
Then my parents adopted me.
My biological mother
had stipulated
that whoever took me
had to be college-educated,
wealthy and catholic.
Paul and Clara jobs
were none of those things,
so my biological mother
wouldn't sign
the adoption papers.
What happened?
There was a legal battle
that went on for a while.
My mother said
she refused to love me
for the first year.
You know,
in case they had to
give me back.
You can't refuse
to love someone, Steve.
Yeah, it turns out
you can.
What the hell can
a one-month-old do that's so bad
his parents give him back?
Nothing. There's nothing
a one-month-old can do--
have you ever thought
about trying to find
your biological father?
I've met
my biological father.
For that matter,
so have you.
It's called macintosh.
Mr. Steve Jobs.
Jandali.
Say hello
to John sculley.
Jandali owns the place,
and John's the ceo of Pepsi,
<i>but I'm trying to get him</i>
<i>to move to cupertino,</i>
<i>put a dent in the universe.</i>
You eat vegan as well?
You're kidding me.
No, I'll eat anything.
Why don't you start off with
the mediterranean lettuce
salad with purslane, mint--
my sister found him.
- Does he know?
- No. In fact,
he bragged to Mona
that Steve Jobs
comes in the restaurant
all the time.
You don't want to--
no.
<i>Don't you think</i>
<i>you should talk to him?</i>
He'd probably
find a reason to sue me.
Oh, Steve--
John, if you're here
about your legacy,
you need to form a line
behind wozniak.
Wozniak's gonna be fine.
I'm the guy
who fired Steve Jobs.
Rich, college-educated
and catholic.
Steve? It's time.
I've gotta go.
Did I do this?
Screw it up?
Let's let it go now.
Has to be time.
Come be our ceo.
Yeah. Okay.
It was the stylus, John.
- What?
- I killed the Newton
because of the stylus.
If you're holding a stylus,
you can't use the other five
that are attached to your wrist.
Things we could have
done together.
God, the things
we could've done.
I'm paying your tuition.
Are you crazy?
Of course
I'm paying your tuition.
I must have misunderstood you
when you said you weren't
paying my tuition.
You and your mom
selling the house
was a hostile thing to do.
She needed the money.
She always needs the money.
She needs a doctor.
She has a sinus infection.
She's had
the same sinus infection
since 1988.
I'm gonna
take care of my mother.
I'm sorry if that angers you.
It does anger me,
because you're a kid
and it's not your job
to take care of your mother.
Is that how yours died?
Guys, step away, please,
and give them some room.
When your mom is 90
and can't feed herself,
you can take care of her.
But right now, she's 45,
perfectly healthy
and can't feed herself.
You're supposed to
work hard at school
and be 19, and that's it.
I'll take care of your mother.
Keep up the good work.
What the hell
do you want from me?
I was sent for.
I bought her a house
for $400,000.
It's worth
twice that much today.
She sold it for two magic rocks
and a bowl of soup.
It was her house.
She used that money
to travel through Europe.
Money which
you make her beg for.
- Steve--
- don't even start with that.
Going to Andy
and asking for the money?
That was so off-the-charts
over the line--
I did not do that.
Andy came to me.
Everybody have
an opinion on this?
I'm sorry, guys.
In 30 seconds,
you're going to be late.
She spends the money on antiques
and then sells them for
a fraction of what she paid,
and she does it with money
i gave to her for you.
Steve--
you came to me hysterical
when you were 13,
asking if you could
live with me--
i was not hysterical.
Because your mom
was screaming at you
every day.
Thirteen was the second time
i asked you.
The stress of her life
as a spiritual healer.
I don't believe
i said you're a bad guy.
But if I did, I'm sorry.
Hey. Something happened
to you at school,
some first semester core class
that all freshmen
are required to take--
- I read<i> time.</i>
- What?
I have Internet access
at school.
I read an old copy of<i> time,</i>
and I asked my mom
some questions
about my family history.
That was--
<i>time</i> wrote
a mangled piece of journal.
You were never
supposed to read that.
I had two different
Harvard statisticians
try to reverse-engineer
the equation
that you came up with
to prove that
28% of American men
could be my father.
Honey, i--
you know, my mother
might be a troubled woman,
but what's your excuse?
That's why I'm not impressed
with your story, dad.
It's that you knew
what I was going through,
and you didn't do
anything about it,
and that makes you
an unconscionable coward.
And not for nothing,
but "think" is a verb,
all right,
making "different"
an adverb.
You're asking people
to think differently.
And you can talk about
the bauhaus movement
and braun and "simplicity
is sophistication"
and issey miyake uniforms
and Bob Dylan lyrics
all you want,
but that thing
looks like Judy jetson's
easy-bake oven.
Hey.
You're gonna start late.
You know what Lisa
stood for?
What?
The computer. The Lisa.
You know what it stood for?
I'm sorry I said that
about the iMac.
It's not what I really think.
Behind my back, at the office,
you know what it stood for?
Local integrated
system architecture.
I was five.
Why couldn't you just lie?
I did.
Of course
it was named after you.
Local integrated
system architecture
doesn't even mean anything.
Why'd you say it wasn't
all those years?
I honestly don't know.
Why'd you say
you weren't my father?
I'm poorly made.
- It's after 9:00.
You're gonna be late.
- I don't care.
- You're writing
for the<i> crimson.</i>
- What?
The apple chapter of
the Harvard alumni association
tells me you're writing
for the<i> crimson.</i>
Oh. Yeah, a little bit.
Essays.
- I'd like to read one.
- Sure.
No, I mean now. I'd like to read
one of your essays now.
Come on.
You've got to go on stage.
The iMac will not be launched
until you give me
one of your essays,
so the world is waiting for you.
I'm really sorry, guys.
Good luck.
I'm gonna put music
in your pocket.
What?
Hundred songs.
A thousand songs.
500 songs.
Somewhere between
500 and a thousand songs
right in your pocket,
'cause I can't stand
looking at that
inexplicable walkman anymore.
You're carrying around a brick
playing cassette tape.
We're not savages.
So I'm gonna put
a thousand songs
in your pocket.
You can do that?
Mm-hmm.
You want to watch
from backstage?
Okay.
Go cue one.
You remember that painting
you did on the original Mac?
I do.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Steve Jobs.</i>
Woz.
Whoo!
