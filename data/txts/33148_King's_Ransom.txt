Ladies.
Good morning, ladies.
JacKass.

Mmm. ThanK you.
Miss Gladys...
I need you to transfer 135,000
to my personal account.
L`m taKing delivery

What did I tell you, Malcolm?
No way.
But it`s my money!
And it`s because of me
Keeping my eye on it...
that you have any left.
You`re just gonna have to drive
one of your other five cars.
Here are your messages.
ThanK you.
Oh. Peaches,
who`s on line two?
Peaches?
Peaches, who is on line two?
- Pea...
- Ange, I forget.
Oh! Great. They hung up.
So, nothing
from Andrew Ross, huh?
Ahem. No.
Damn it.
LooK, if we don`t close
this deal now...
l`m gonna have to wait
another six weeKs.
He`s about to go on
this stupid hot-air balloon...
around-the-world expedition.
You Know, white folKs is crazy.
But their money is sane.
Whoo! Their money is sane.
You are about to give
a big old party...
celebrating the tenth
anniversary of your company.
Why would you want to sell it
off to some spoiled rich Kid...
IooKing to cash in
on what you`ve built?
Because
that spoiled rich Kid...
is about to give me
25 million for my company...
so you damn well better
start warming up to him.
``Damn well``?!
What did I tell you
about your mouth, boy?
You Know I don`t liKe
no cussin` up in here.
Cuss again,
l`ll hit you upside your head.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.
Your wife`s lawyer agreed
to have the meeting...
in the conference room
here tomorrow.
So... you finally decided
to divorce the bitch, huh?
The bitch... is history.
Ow! What?!
What did I tell you
about your mouth?
But you just said
the same thing, Miss Gladys!
Well, if I jump off a bridge,
you gonna jump off one, too?
Lt`s not going so good
with Peaches, huh?
Ohh...
If this were a strip club
or an airhead convention.
The last time I checKed,
we were a marKeting firm.
This is a place of business.
We got worK to do.
Angela, all God`s children
deserve a chance.
Her dumb ass deserves the boot!
OK, that`s not nice.
``Not nice``? Get...
l`m gonna tell you
what`s not nice.
It`s Malcolm King forcing me
to hire another one...
of his incompetent little
hoochies as my assistant.
I Know.
I can`t stand Malcolm King...
and King Enterprises.
But if I wasn`t a locK
for that V.P. Position...
I would be out of here so fast.
- Oh, I Know.
- I deserve the promotion anyway.
L`ve been doing the damn job
for the past few months.
L`ve got a master`s degree
from Yale.
- Yale.
- And 10 years of experience.
I just got
the car of my dreams...
I closed escrow
on a pretty three-bedroom.
I mean, my apartment
is pacKed up already.
L`ve got to get that promotion.
Do you want me
to say a prayer for you?
Not now.
I don`t want you to taKe this
the wrong way...
Yeah?
But ever since you got saved...
you`ve been a little...
extra with the God stuff.
Extra?
Extra.
- My Jesus piece?
- Yeah.
I just got it.
It`s great, right?
Why is this happening?
My milKshaKe brings
all the boys to the yard
Guys, scram!
Peaches, don`t you have
some worK to do?
I finished my coloring.
Marco, taKe my coat.
TaKe my coat.
Yeah, you did
a good job on this, man...
but I thinK
you need to get the bacK.
- Ahem.
- Yeah.
That`s a nice ride
you got there.
What does the ``King`` stand for?
That`s my last name.
Ah, really?
So, what`s your first name?
Malcolm.
Mmm.
Corey, get up here!
Coming, Granny.
$300, and you got
all those wonderful things.
And l`m going to show you...
MaKe yourself useful.
Go picK me up a pacK of smoKes.
Hand me my massage pillow,
will you?
Right now, tonight.
But now we`ve got
to get two traders...
who will risK what
they`ve already won...
Here you go. OK?
...sofa and color TV
worth 2,190...
and they`re ready to go.
Unh!
What`s the matter, big brother?
Ain`t you glad to see me?
Yeah. No!
What are you doing, Raven?
I thought you were still
in prison for armed robbery.
Yeah, well, I was until
I broKe out this morning.
- Ahh! Ahh! Hey!
- Listen.
I need you to get me money.
Enough to buy me
a Mexican vacation.
I don`t have any money, Raven.
I Know that, loser.
I got a plan,
and I need your help.
Well, whatever your plan is,
I don`t want any part of it.
Shut up. You`re gonna do
exactly what I tell you to do.
You been hearing about this
little boy who got Kidnapped?
- Yeah.
- Well, that`s the plan.
You`re gonna help me
Kidnap some...
No, no,
l`m not Kidnapping anybody.
Then you better figure out a way
to turn no dollars into $10,000.
L... $10,000?
There`s no way I can do that.
LooK, if I get caught again,
you`re going down with me...
and we both Know you won`t last
one second in prison.
Raven...
Ten grand, Corey.
L`ll be in touch.
Give me Malcolm.
Hold on.
The bitch is on line one.
Damn it! OK.
You want me to stop?
Oh, no, baby, Keep going.
Uh, Renee, what`s up?
What do you want?
Miss Gladys?
Miss Gladys,
there is nobody on line one!
I thinK I accidentally
hung up on her.
Mmm! Oh, get bacK to worK, baby.
Mmm! Hot damn! Whoo!
Malcolm King`s office.
You hung up on me,
you old witch.
Call me that again,
and I will snatch...
every bit of faKe hair
out of your nappy head.
Just do your job
and get Malcolm.
Gold-digger. Hold on!
Oh!
She`s on line one.
What do you want, Renee?
Ah, there you are.
Must you cancel
all of my credit cards?
What am I supposed
to do for money?
Hell if I care.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
That sounds embarrassing.
Where were you
when they canceled...
all of your credit cards?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha.
Laugh all you want to now...
but we`ll see who`s laughing
after the divorce...
because my lawyer assured me
that I will be getting...
a very lucrative
divorce settlement...
very lucrative.
At least half, maybe more.
And just liKe sex with you
after two minutes...
this conversation is over.
Ah!
Uh-oh.
I Know he`s gonna
try something slicK...
to get out of paying me.
Don`t you have some worK to do?
L`m...
finished with the pool.
I wasn`t talKing about...
the pool.
You must thinK that I have
very poor eyesight, Counselor.
Your list of marital assets
has several glaring omissions...
most notably,
King Enterprises.
And its holdings.
For the one hundredth time,
Anita...
King Enterprises Limited...
is the sole ownership
of Malcolm King...
and I will not...
we will not stand by...
and watch it be broKen up
out of spite.
- Your food`s here.
- Oh, thanK you.
Oh, let me guess...
Kung pao chicKen
without vegetables...
not too spicy,
all white meat...
with extra fortune cooKies.
He gets the same thing
all of the time.
Bo... ring.
Can we offer
you ladies anything?
No, thanK you.
L`m not hungry.
Oh, hell.
Why don`t I just taKe half
of Malcolm`s food anyway?
Note that.
LooK, Counselor,
Renee has been with Malcolm...
since the very beginning
of King Enterprises...
and deserves a half a share
of the company.
- What?
- Hell, I deserve all of it.
- You said so yourself.
- When?
Find that little thing.
Please.
Ah, here is it.
``My dearest Renee...
``everything I have built,
I built for you.
``Love always, Malcolm. ``
Ooh. Poetry.
It`s a greeting card, man.
I was drunK when I wrote it...
and she was butt-naKed
on the floor. What?
We are seeKing
the primary residence...
as well as
one of the vacation homes.
L`ve already gone ahead and
had the laKe house appraised.
The details are inside.
Now, as far as
preliminary meetings go...
it wasn`t so bad.
I need that money, Anita.
This hair does not grow
on trees.
Hello?
Hi. Hi, Mrs. King.
LooKs liKe we`re gonna have
to do this the hard way.
You Know, l`m just gonna
call you Renee.
No, you won`t.
What?
Well, this is disastrous.
What`s wrong?
Another divorce case that l`ve
been worKing on for months...
but my client
neglected to tell me...
that she has been having
an affair.
Mm-hmm.
And guess what?
The judge found out.
I sure hope
the sex was worth it...
because she just cost
herself millions.
Ooh.
So, you just gonna let them
waltz outta here liKe that, huh?
I can`t maKe them
taKe our offer, Malcolm.
Listen... listen to me.
There is a very real chance...
Renee could walK out of this
with half of King Enterprises.
That... that valentine
was brilliant, man.
David. David!
I will handle it myself.
Malcolm, I Know that looK.
I Know that...
Do not do anything crazy.
Do not.
ThanKs for nothing, David.
See yourself out.
Malcolm.
Malcolm.
Malcolm!
OK, let me
rocK you steady, ma
Dollars don`t fall, man,
it`s not confetti
This ain`t a punchline,
battle rhyme, lunch line
This is just to get you
twistin` up your body one time
If not one time,
do it two
One, two, three, shoot.
Sorry.
- Oh.
- Oh, thanK you.
- Andre, right?
- Yeah.
Oh, good.
I need to asK you a favor.
Whassup, whassup, whassup?
Oh, well, oh...
I was hoping you could wax this
real good for me...
and try not
to leave any scratches.
Hey, well, you Know,
whatever you`re into, baby.
So, you`re gonna hooK me up?
Hell, yes.
Oh! Ha ha ha!
You`re so sweet.
Um, l`ll call and set up
a time with you later.
And don`t worry.
L`ll definitely
maKe it worth your while.
Oh. Mwah.
ThanK you.
Hee hee hee hee!

Yo!

Oh! ThanK you.
My rump shaKe`s

I Know you liKe it,

Whoo! Ha ha ha ha!
Yes, I can
Somebody parK the car.
Good morning, Miss Gladys.
Good morning.
Oh, you made the front page.
What?
Mm-hmm.
That little punK.
He told me
this wasn`t supposed to run...
until a weeK from Sunday.
This is just gonna give
Renee more ammo...
and my blacK ass is the target.
Malcolm King.
Cha-ching, cha-ching,
cha-ching.
Good-bye.
Heh heh heh heh.
Ohh.
Oh, my God. What`d she say?
Oh, my God!

Pull yourself together now.
Straighten up.

Get a real job!
ThinK fast.

Mind if I join you?
You Know, son,

Oh, sure, everyone thinKs being
shift manager is all glory.
And it is.
But there are also times...
when l`m forced to maKe
the tough calls...
times liKe these.
You`re firing me?
Yeah, l`m firing you.
You see, your energy level is
just not where it used to be...
and as the team leader...
I need everyone to be

of little MarK Wilson.
He was safely returned
to his parents...
Oh, shut up.
After they conceded
to the Kidnappers` demands...
and paid
a $5-million ransom.
Still, the Kidnappers
remain at large...
and authorities have few leads.
You Know, Bill,
that`s a lot of money.
Huh. Damn right, it is.
That`s it. That`s it.
I Know what we`re gonna do.
I Know what we`re gonna do.

That`s right.
I want you to Kidnap his ass.
But why would you
Kidnap yourself?
To Keep Renee

Just in case
this divorce settlement...
does not worK out in my favor...
I want to maKe sure
that I get some money.
And you Know
what the best part is?
- What?
- I won`t be in any real danger.

- Why?
Because l`m gonna hire

Do you Know how humiliated
my parents would be...
if I was implicated in
a Kidnapping?
- You can`t thinK about them.
- Exactly.
L`d be liKe Patty Hearst,
but with way better hair.
Yes. Now you`re talKing.
You two are seriously talKing
about Kidnapping someone?
- We`ll tape his mouth.
- No.
Malcolm King can`t talK.
We`ll tie him up.
We`ll tie his hands,
we`ll tie his feet...
and we`ll jiggle him.
We`ll just shaKe
all that blubber...
and we`ll just maKe him beg.
Tomorrow...
Malcolm King...
is getting Kidnapped.
Capisce?
L`ll see you tomorrow night,
Malcolm King.
Ha ha ha! Fun.
Oh! Aah!
Malcolm, baby, come to bed.
Uh-uh. Not right now, baby.
L`m almost finished.
L`m almost finished.
Ah. Not for nothing, baby...
this has got to be
the best Kidnapping plan ever.
Hmm. LooK at this.
L`ll be last seen
at around 11:00 P.M., right?
Mmm.
OK, l`ll be bacK
in a minute. Ha ha ha!
Oh, and then l`m grabbed
outside the benefit at 11:00.
LooK, you see that? Boom, right?
And then l`m taKen
to the secret location.
Now, just to throw people off...
a ransom note will be sent
to my gold-digging wife...
demanding $10 million
for my safe return.
Uh-huh. And it`s gonna contain
all the usual stuff.
You Know,
don`t contact the police...
or the media...
blah, blah, blah...
because if you do,
we`re gonna Kill him.
Hmm. Yes. Now looK at Renee.
When she hears this...
she probably
gonna start celebrating.
Then she`ll remember
that I cut her out of my will.
Ooh!
And then it sinKs in.
No Malcolm, no money.
- Ha ha!
- Wow.
So now she has
to call the only person...
that has access to my money.
Bam! Miss Gladys.
And you Know Miss Gladys
would never let...
a hair on my pretty little
head be harmed. Ha ha!
So, Miss Gladys maKes the drop.
Ooh. Ooh. Hmm.
This is my favorite part, baby.
Renee... how she lives afterwards.
She slides into
a soul-deadening spiral...
into the bottom of
the deep bowels of the earth.
LooK, and then
she livin` in Tent City...
by the freeway in L.A.
By the Staples Center.
That`s her living in a tent.
LooK at her.
LooK at her, looK at her.
LooK at her.
It`s flawless, baby.
It`s... it`s amazing.
- Except...
- Except what?
Except...
I need somebody to actually
grab me outside of the benefit.
Somebody that the police
could never connect me to.
Mmm.
A disposable dumb-ass
to taKe the dive.
But who?
What about my brother?
Huh?
L`m picKing him up tomorrow.
He could use the worK.
He`s had trouble
holding down jobs in the past.
Heh. Your brother.
What`s he liKe?
Oh, he`s... he`s super-smart.
He`s a real sweetheart.
Everyone loves him.
Nothin` can stop me now
ClicK-clacK,
then all you hear is pow...
Heh.
Ahh.
Call me the riser
`cause I stay with the heat
lmagine, if you will,
your worst nightmare
Mobbin` through your hood,
your life is in danger
lmagine, if you will,
your worst nightmare
Bang on the catwalK,
slicK with the gun talK
Oh! Guess what?
I got a way
you can maKe some big money...
but it`s a top-secret plan...
which means
you can`t tell anyone.
So, it`s too bad
your Mercedes got stolen...
and we had
to taKe a cab tonight.
I Know, right?
ThanKs for paying for it.
Appreciate that.
LooK, when
we`re in this party...
a lot of people in there
gonna be calling me Andre...
and that`s because, you Know...
I tell my employees,
``Call me Andre. ``
I don`t liKe my employees

I understand.
You can`t let your employees
get too familiar.
- You are so smart.
- ThanK you very much.
- Andre, hi.
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Well, do you remember what

Hell, yeah.
Oh, good. Well, I Know

You just tell me when,

Oh! I love him!

You`re so welcome.

Am I crazy? Huh?

Seeing things

Is that the problem?
You Know what?
Don`t even say anything.
You Know why?
L`ve had enough of this.
You can`t handle this anyway.

Whew. Oh, what am I doing?
I don`t have the heart for this.
Man, l`m no Kidnapper.
Well, hell, man...
I don`t have experience

And your sister never told me
you were so recKless.
Oh, wait a minute.
You Know my sister?
Wait, wait. Know her?
- L`m sleeping with her.
- Eww.
She was the one
that helped me...
come up with this plan
for you to Kidnap me.
You`re the dude
with the jacKed-up shoes.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha.
Oh, my God.
You tooK my plan
to a whole `nother level, man.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Hey, the way you came
to my job and cased it.
Right.
And the masKs.
And the... and the...
and the switching of the cars.
Ohh.
Oh, man!
And then bringing me...
to this hole-in-the-wall
cracKhouse.
Yeah, man. `cause
they would`ve recognized me...
down at the Terrance Hotel.
Man, this was smart
bringing me here.
`Cause, hell, nobody`s gonna
recognize me here.
Well...
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Heh heh.
Your sister was right, man.
You are smart.
My sister said that about me?
Wait, wait. Hold it.
- You`re white.
- Yeah.
- But your sister is...
- She`s adopted.
My grandmother adopted her
when I was two years old.
Oh.
Shh. That`s my grandma.
L`ll handle this.
Stay there.
You`re gonna
burn this place down...
you deaf old hag.
She`s deaf.
I unplug this,
she doesn`t hear a thing.
Raaaaar!
Raaah! Ha ha ha!

And sad.
L`ll show you my spot.
Ah.
You live down here?

Tch. Pathetic.
You`re a grown man...
and you live in
your grandmother`s basement?
L`m saving up
for my own place, you Know?
What the hell is this?
Lt`s my birdhouse.
- You made this yourself?
- Yes, I did.
- On purpose?
- Yeah.
What, you did it
drunK and blindfolded?
No.
Damn. Hey, you Know what?
Don`t even worry about that...
because with the money
l`m paying you for this...
you`ll be able to afford
your own place.
Your sister did tell you
you`re getting paid for this?
No, not exact...
Not exactly, you Know?
We didn`t... we didn`t
really discuss it.
Uh...
I have to be honest with you.
L`m really confused.
Heh. Yeah, I can see that.
L`m surprised
you even Know my sister.
My sister came up
with this plan?
How do you guys even Know
each other again?
LooK, I Know it`s hard
for you to believe, man...
especially considering
how dumb your sister really is.
- Yeah.
- Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey,
but every once in a while...
she`ll say something
that`s not dipped in stupid.
Right.
And coming up
with this plan with me...
was one of those times.
This where I sleep?
Uhh.
Ooh.
Whassup?
Whassup?
Uhh.
Whassup?
Aaaaah!

Just tell me where I am!
No, no!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Calm down.
L`m calm.
Now, you don`t want me
to get upset.
I must`ve used
too much chloroform.
You`re in the Terrance Hotel.
Behind you over there

Some fill-ett mig-non

He`s on the down low.
Malcolm loves his money
more than life itself.
Those Kidnappers
aren`t seeing a cent.
All right,
we got some leads here...
A 9-1-1 call
from Malcolm King...
came through our switchboard
at 11:14 last night...
and a limousine registered
to King Enterprises...
found abandoned on the highway.
LooK, hey,
we`re in good shape here.
You leave this
in our hands, ma`am.
We pulled a partial footprint
from the scene.
It`s being analyzed
in forensics.
Those boys down at C.S. I...
l`m telling you,

and they just scan...
I don`t Know why

Inspector Gadget bullsh...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady.

This is our job.
We Know what we`re doing.
If you Knew

You`d be out tracKing down
your primary suspects.
And who might that be?
Hello. May I help you?
Renee King?
Yes.
Do you mind if we come in?
Yes?
Angela DraKe, I presume?
Hey, hey, where the hell
have you been, huh?
Did you forget that you were
supposed to follow up...
with Renee about the ransom?
And you`ve got nothing
to eat down here but crap.
Where`s the real food?
You Know what, Mr. King?
I will maKe you a TV dinner.
For lunch?
That`s the dumbest thing
l`ve ever heard.
Hey... remember

I was lying, all right?
You`re just as dumb
as your dumb-ass sister.
Call Renee.
Hello?

Hey, hey, get up here!
Jesus, Granny,

Hurry up...
You Know who it is
and you Know why l`m calling.
You better be getting me

or I might just have
to go tell the police...
how you masterminded
a recent outbreaK...
of semi-violent
convenience store robberies.
You`re running out of time.
Damn.
All right.
I guess I got the right one.
Billionaire Andrew Ross...
is in critical condition
after his hot-air balloon...
plummeted to the ground
in the jungles of Africa.
He was then attacKed
by a wild rhinoceros.
White folKs.
Hey, it tooK you

L`m starving.
Where`s my change?
Ohh.
Oh, man,
they put mustard on this.
I told the guy no mustard.
Well, taKe it bacK, man.
Aw, it`s no big deal.
Come on, man, you let people
taKe advantage of you.
You paid for it.
You should get what you want.
It`s no biggie, really.
You Know what?
You ain`t got no balls.
You see me? I don`t taKe
nothin` from nobody.
You want to Know why?
`Cause I got big balls.
I got big manly balls.
Big manly, hairy,
sharK-infested swimmin`...
My balls are so... They hang
to the bacK of my Knee...
when I wear shorts.
And you Know what?
I ain`t afraid to let `em
hang for nobody.
It must be hard for you
to buy underpants.
Ha ha ha ha!
Shut up, stupid.
You`ve got to stop letting
people taKe advantage of you.
LooK, it`s just a sandwich.
Let me show you what l`d do
if it was my sandwich.
Be the man at the counter.
L`m gonna be me.
- Yeah, get at the counter.

Yes, looK at this, man!
I asKed for no mustard!
What`s this looK liKe to you?

And since you obviously do not

Here, hold that for me.
ThanK you.
OK, that`s mustard. All right?
That`s mustard right there.
Uh-huh, yeah. Now,
I guarantee if you do that...
they`ll never mess

You get any winners yet?
Do you hear me screaming?
You guys follow up
on the leads I gave you?
Yes, we did.
And?
And nothing.
LooK, lady,
l`ve just about had it with you.
Go home. When we have
something to tell you...
we`ll let you Know.
This case is all about...
official police business.
We don`t need you...
I don`t give a damn
about official police business.
Malcolm King is my business.
L`m gonna leave now,
not because you told me to...
but because
if I don`t leave now...
I won`t be able to get
my numbers in.
But l`ll be bacK.
And until you find him...
l`m gonna stay on y`all
liKe white girls on NBA players.
Who is it?
- It`s us... BrooKe and Kim.
- Hi!
Come in. The door`s open.
What tooK you guys so long?
Huh? The police were here.
They were asKing questions
about Mr. King.
You guys, I thinK
we should go to the police...
and tell them everything
that we Know.
I mean, it`s not liKe
we actually Kidnapped anybody.
- Yes, we did.
- Well, mostly we didn`t.
That`s a great idea, Kim.
Unbelievable!
I believe the charge
is conspiracy to Kidnapping.
- OK?
- Yeah.
I learned a thing or two
about the criminal code...
when I was at Cornell.
- Cornell?
- Cornell?
I thought you said you went to...
Didn`t she go to Harvard?
- Right, but she did...
- No, it was...
Undergrad at Yale.
And then when she went
to Princeton, she was...
No, it was Harvard,
and then she went...
- Where`d she do her doctorate?
- I lied!
What?
I went to DeVry Institute.
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
And I didn`t finish.
And for whatever reason,
the King Enterprises...
didn`t checK that pacK of lies
I called a rësumë.
Oh, my God.
LooK, I got a G.E.D.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
And an lvy League
mortgage payment.
So that maKes me
one desperate, dangerous woman.
So until this thing
blows over...
l`m not letting either
one of you aspiring snitches...
out of my sight.
Is that clear?
- Yeah, but, liKe...
- Yeah, you Know...
I said... is that clear?
- Crystal.
- Crystal.
Dinner is served.
Ha ha.
I wouldn`t feed
that garbage to a dog.
You Know what?
I need you to go down
to PeKing Palace for me, man...
get me something to eat.
Get me
some Kung pao chicKen...
no vegetables, not too spicy...
all white meat,
extra fortune cooKies.
Hey! Hurry up, l`m starving.
That tooK me
six to eight minutes to maKe.
It should taKe you that long
to get it out of my face.
Well...
What`d you say?
I called in an order for Renee.
Oh, yes. Order for Renee.
It is almost ready.
It just be one second.
Why don`t you have a seat?
I will bring it
right for you. OK?
Maybe you will have
a seat right there...
and you can maybe
sing some KaraoKe, OK?
You have some fun.
I don`t thinK so.
Yeah, yeah
It should be OK.
What is taKing so long?
What the hell`s
going on down there?
If I gotta come bacK there
and KicK someone`s ass...
Come on. Now get this one.
OK, for you, sir,
your order is now ready.
See? There is one order
of Kung pao chicKen...

Huh? Huh?
L`m a blacK man.

Who`s Peaches?
Hey, let`s not play games

Just hurry your ass upstairs

Herb? Who`s Herb?
Ha ha, very funny.
Your name`s not Herb...

LooK, stop playing with me, man.
L`m not playing games.
My name`s not Herb.
It`s Corey, and my sister`s
name isn`t Peaches.
It`s Raven.
Watch, l`ll show you a picture.
LooK, that`s my sister.
That`s Raven.
If you`re not
Peaches` brother...
then l`ve been Kidnapped
for real.
Oh!
Ow!
- Whoa!
- Aha!
- The hell?
- Yes, I Knew it!
I Knew it!
Kung pao chicKen...
Renee, what the hell

The better question is,
what are you doing here?
Whoa!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
What is this?
Uhh! Uhh!
Damn it!
Untie us right now, man.
L`m not gonna say it again.
L`m sorry. I can`t do that.
Why not?
`Cause I just need some time
to thinK things out, you guys.
LooK, Mr. King, I didn`t
want to Kidnap you ever.
Really. I really didn`t.
I even tried to let you go.
You Know that, but you insisted
on going through...
with your plan
of having yourself Kidnapped...
so you wouldn`t have to give her
a divorce settlement.
Hold on.
His what to do what?
He was planning
to have himself Kidnapped...
so he wouldn`t have to pay you
a big divorce settlement.
Shut up!
Ooh. I Knew you were
gonna try something slicK...
to get out of paying me.
But Kidnapping yourself?!
Malcolm, this is really low,
even for you.
What about you?
You said yourself...
you wanted to have him
Kidnapped.
I did not.
What are you talKing about?
I don`t even Know you.
Right after
you fell down the stairs.
You were all delirious
and mumbling.
``I was gonna Kidnap you,
too, Malcolm. ``
l... Shut... Shut it up!
- Uhh!
- Ohh! Hey!
What Kind of woman wants
to Kidnap her own husband?
The Kind that would marry a man
who`d faKe his own Kidnapping...
to get out of
a divorce settlement.
Just shut it, Renee!
- You shut it!
- Shut it up!
Be quiet, please.
My granny is sleeping.
To hell with your grandmother!
What`s wrong with you?
Don`t be...
First of all,
don`t be yelling at me.
L`m the only friend

you guys sure don`t seem
to love each other.
- We don`t!
- We don`t!
Room service!
Peach... Peaches,
what you doing here?
I have to see Malcolm.
I miss him too much.
Hey, now, the plan was that
you wasn`t gonna see him...
until after we get finished.
I Know, I Know,
and I won`t see him.
LooK, l`ll turn off the lights
and l`ll even wear this.
- Blindfold.
- See? We won`t see each other.

Baby. Ohh.
Mmm.
Don`t be mad at me.

And don`t say anything.

Aw, baby.
You lost so much weight.
Hey, where did that come from?
Oh ho ho! Wow!
Ohh. Ha ha!

Bad news. I can`t let you go.
OK, when you say ``you, ``
you mean her, right?
No, I mean the both of you.
I can`t let you go.
What do you mean,
you can`t let me go?
Man, what are you

I could go to jail
for the rest of my life!
Man, that`s not that long!
W-what?
Hey, hey, hey,

We promise.
``You promise. `` People breaK
their promises all the time.
Not us.
You guys got married
and you promised...
that you would obey and cherish
and love each other.
Now you`re getting a divorce.
You broKe those promises!
That`s different.
How is it different?
LooK, I don`t Know how
it`s different.
It`s just different,
OK, stupid?

I just called you dummy, dummy.
Oh, I got your dummy right here.
Shut up! By the way,

the truth finally came out!
- What truth?!

Turn to ``106 and ParK. ``
OK.
Actually, I don`t want

I would liKe to watch
``Dr. Phil, `` please.
You and big-head Dr. Phil
both can Kiss my blacK ass.
We`re watching ``106 and ParK. ``
We should watch something that
elevates our consciousness.
- We need to watch...
- Hey!
- What?
- Listen to me.
Maybe when l`m done playing
my video game...
maybe we can watch
the first half of ``106 and ParK``
and the second half
of ``Dr. Phil``...
if I feel liKe it.
Hey, hey, hey, what Kind
of nonsense is that, huh?
Who watches half a show?
Yeah, and everybody Knows
the best part of ``Dr. Phil``...
is in the beginning.
Huh. If you watch him.
Well, I do.
That`s why I Know...

- You Know what?
Because I could Kill you

I could bash your head in
liKe a melon if I felt liKe it!
And nobody would even care.
You want to Know why?
Because you are a jacKass!
A jacKass!
You`re a jacKass,

No wonder everybody hates you!
L`ve Known you a day...
