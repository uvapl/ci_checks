What are we doing?
You ready?
one, two, three.
You tell me
if it happened.
The band, train,
just for you.
this is awesome.
I'm ready to have a lot
of fun with these ladies.
quiet on the set!
Stay away from my man.
<i>I feel like I'm on my way
to finding my wife.</i>
This is the best date
I've ever been on.
Oh, my god! Stop it!
But I'm so scared, because
these women have so much doubt.
You have walls.
What?
We all know what happened
last season,
And who's to say
you won't do that again?
At the end of the day,
this is very real, okay?
I know.
You're scaring me, though.
My fear is that you feel
obligated to choose somebody,
And I'm scared.
I'm being pulled
in so many damn directions.
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing right now.
it's really hard to get me
To my breaking point,
but I'm there.
I feel like certain girls
Are emotionally stable
and others aren't,
But I think that's something
that brad has to figure out.
People are gonna
piss me off today. I know it.
You are like a toxic disease
to me in this journey.
she is psycho.
No, actually,
you are psycho.
<i>It's all coming up tonight</i>
<i>On...</i>
waking up in l.A. Today,
all of this became so real.
Never in a million years
did I think
I was gonna be the bachelor
again.
I'm a little nervous,
but I could not be happier.
Last night these women
put me through the wringer
A little bit, but I understand
where they're coming from.
I didn't find love before,
but if it happens again,
But I know
I'm a different person
Than I was three years ago.
I want to find somebody.
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.
I've been given
an amazing second chance,
And it starts today.
It begins right now.
ladies,
come on in and join me
In the living room,
please.
Ladies, welcome.
How's the house?
Awesome.
Great.
All right. Let's talk
about how this all works.
Each week, you'll be going
on dates with brad--
Group dates,
individual dates.
On each date,
there will be a rose.
If you get a rose, you're safe
at the next rose ceremony.
Now the individual date--
it's a little more complicated.
If you do not get a rose
on this date,
You're going home immediately.
My advice to you--
Whenever you get time
with brad, use it wisely,
Because not everybody will get
a date with brad every week.
Who's going, where you'll be
going, what it's all about--
You'll find out
as the date cards arrive,
And I do have your first one
right here.
So I will put this
right here.
oh, my gosh.
Have a good one.
thanks, chris.
all right.
Are you ladies ready?
Yes.
Yes.
It's very, like, imperative
that I get this date.
I've been thinking about
doing this for eight years.
I spent a fortune on clothes
and dresses and gowns,
And, like, I quit my job. I did
all these things to be here,
And I so badly want brad
to get to know me.
"ashley h."
Whoo!
"the road to love is
a wild ride."
"brad."
I was freaking out
When I found out
that I had the first date.
I feel like it's an honor,
and it's the first time
He's taking a girl out, and I'm
just so amazed that he chose me.
it was hard
To watch the other ashley
get the date card.
I mean, obviously if, you know,
I get the first impression rose,
And she gets the first date,
he likes us.
I just hope he likes me more.
tonight's my very first date.
I'm excited,
but I am very nervous.
I promised myself
that this time around,
I would have fun
and put myself out there.
aah!
What's up, ladies?
You're a sight for sore eyes.
I have the most amazing
night planned for ashley.
Hello.
Look at you. My god.
I want to see if we
can laugh, we can be ourselves.
Let's just let go
and have some fun.
bye, guys.
bye!
Have a good night.
have her home
before 10:00!
He's perfect.
I love his suit... His face.
<i>oh, my gosh.
I want to be her.</i>
Oh, my god.
It is a beautiful night.
it's a perfect night.
I know.
Perfect night
for what we're gonna do.
We're gonna have
a lot of fun.
Ashley has absolutely no clue
where we're going.
I can't wait to see her face
light up when she sees
What I have planned for her
tonight.
Oh, my god.
What are we doing?
It's dark, isn't it?
so brad and I
are driving along the road,
And all of a sudden, we take
a turn onto this dirt road.
It's pitch-dark. I have
no idea where the heck we are.
So--
oh, my god.
I'm freaking out right now.
No. Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.
Okay.
So I'm going to stop
right here...
Okay.
And we're gonna walk
a little ways, okay?
Okay.
So here we go.
it is so dark.
yeah, it is.
Just be really careful.
Watch your step.
oh, my god!
Okay. All right.
Are you okay?
Where are we going?
usually my dates don't start off
On a deserted dirt road
in the pitch-black.
It feels like
something out of a horror movie.
Oh, my god.
What are we doing?
Remember the card.
But--
"wild ride," right?
I know, but--
So I'm gonna ask you
a big favor.
What?
Flip this switch.
Okay.
Okay? You ready?
one, two, three!
You made it happen.
So we're at a carnival,
all for you.
<i>What--
who are we right now?
Okay. So...
come on.</i>
Oh, my god.
Come on. Where do you want
to go first?
I love it. Right here.
I see this carnival come to life
Right in front of us,
and I feel amazing.
I feel like I'm a kid
all over again.
How old are we right now?
Seriously.
it doesn't matter
how old we are. Let's be 5.
I felt, like, so special.
it was just for us.
Nice!
Yes! We both got one.
Teamwork. Nice job.
Good job.
That's good. Ow!
oh.
when ashley and I were
running through the carnival,
I just kept seeing how
she was smiling and giggling.
She didn't care that
she was in this fancy dress.
She didn't care about anything
except living in the moment.
You good?
You hanging in there?
yes. Aah!
It's going faster.
Okay. Aah! This is awesome.
this carnival date
is perfect for me.
I mean, I get to dress up
like a princess
And, like, still, like, be
very childlike and play around,
And it's, like, romantic
and flirty. It's just perfect.
Oh, my god.
This is awesome!
Yeah.
Holy crap. I don't want to spin
though. I don't want to spin!
Okay. All right. No spinning.
tonight I am having
such a good time with ashley.
It's been a lot of years
Since I've met a girl
right off the bat
And felt comfortable enough
to just be me.
This is the best date
I've ever been on...
And I'm not even joking.
Score. Score. And it's not
even halfway over yet.
I know!
I think him and ashley
could have a connection.
I mean, obviously they did,
if they're going on this.
oh, she's adorable
and we love her...
Fun.
But we don't want her
to come home.
Door.
What is it?
Date card.
Grab it! Aah!
read it!
Go. Open it.
Everybody ready?
no.
"let's share something
from the heart.
Keltie..."
whoo!
"chantal o., madison,
"melissa, kimberly,
Marissa, raichel, britt."
That's a big group date.
"meghan,
"emily, stacey,
"alli, shawntel m.,
Michelle, and lisa."
how many girls is that?
15 girls.
what?
15 girls.
15 of us... And brad.
It's gonna be so hard
Trying to get my time
with him.
I think you guys are
all great, but I did not want
To spend this day with you
tomorrow. It's my birthday.
ohh.
Tomorrow's your birthday?
I would really just love some,
like, one-on-one time with him
For my birthday.
Instead, I'm gonna be competing
With 14 other women, so, yeah,
tomorrow's gonna drive me crazy.
Guaranteed.
Okay, okay, okay.
Here we go. Here we go.
oh, my god.
Okay. There's the camera.
Okay.
Wait.
hold on. Wait, wait.
We're already on second shot.
I'm having so much fun
right now with brad.
I really feel like
brad and I are connecting.
All right.
Cotton candy maybe?
I just hope that
he feels the same way.
<i>the thought of me leaving here
without a rose tonight</i>
Is just heartbreaking.
No, you gotta get closer.
Nice.
<i>let's face it.
This girl is the entire package.</i>
She's intelligent, pretty.
I feel like I can be myself
around her.
I like this girl.
I like this girl a lot.
Come here.
Standing here kissing brad
just feels amazing.
I never thought that
I would, like, fall so quickly
For somebody.
This is all so new to me.
I can see myself with him,
and this first date is just,
Like, the start of something
that could be really great.
Can you do it again?
Yes.
I love this date.
I know. It's perfect.
walking ashley through
this carnival is beyond words.
You know, I'm running around.
I'm having fun.
I find myself feeling
like a kid.
So cute!
Take the bear.
Hi, bear!
This is my very first date,
And I am having the time
of my life with this girl.
Cheers to...
Cheers to tonight.
By far, the best date
I've been on maybe in years.
Yeah. Same. Honestly, same.
Cheers.
cheers.
So tell me about you.
What makes you you?
So, okay, something that's
really important to me.
Okay, so we'll start off
with this. So I spoke to you...
Okay.
Like, how I'm very ambitious
and, like, driven.
Yeah.
I need to be able to stand on
my own two feet, just in case
Something were to happen, just
like what happened to my m--
whoa, wait. Wait, wait,
wait. Wait, wait.
You sound like you're
preparing for the worst.
I--well, this is the thing.
I don't want the worst,
But you always have to be
prepared for the worst.
I'm looking for something,
like, very stable,
And that partially has to do
with my mother.
Uh, my mother's the one
that really took care of us.
My father was not there. He had,
like, problems with addiction.
We didn't have
a very good relationship.
You know, he was homeless almost
my whole life. He still is.
So my father being gone--
that's a big part of me.
Let me ask you, is your father
around at all right now?
Mm. I don't know
where he is, to be honest.
Really?
Yeah.
Uh...
So...
We're
a little too much alike. Uh...
Are we?
Yeah. A little bit.
How so?
Uh... So honestly...
What?
Uh, no, just, uh...
This--this is when I start
getting uncomfortable.
Okay, what?
You're freaking me out.
Not at all--no, no, no. No.
I don't want to freak you
out at all.
Mm-hmm.
I'm trying--I'm not a guy
that just spews out emotions,
But our dad--he split
at an early age, same thing.
There was some addiction there,
I think. I don't know.
Um, the guy was just
not around.
I mean, years would pass.
He, uh...
He'd come in
When we had all
but forgotten about the guy,
And he'd pop back
in our lives.
Mm-hmm.
You know,
I'd be 12 years old.
He'd call, and "I want
to take you guys shopping.
I'm coming
to pick you guys up."
You know,
and I swear to god,
I wouldn't hear from him
until I was 16.
It was tough.
It was really, really tough.
So I just
really relate about
People not being there
for you in your life.
But does it make you want--
Like, does it make you
a better man,
A better, like,
potential father,
And, like, husband
and all that kind of stuff?
That guy has given me
every example
Of what I don't want
to be.
Mm-hmm.
Unfortunately, as much as I
don't want this guy to...
Mm-hmm.
To be an influence,
I think, unfortunately,
He scared me a little bit
and kind of made me
Push people away.
You know what I mean?
Hence, my last run at this go--
at this thing.
So you think that has
to do with, like...
Yeah.
Really?
It's tough. It's really--
when did you realize that?
Like, when did--
Three years ago.
Mm.
Yeah. No kidding. I just
realized I needed to change...
Mm-hmm.
'cause I didn't want to be
lonely at all.
Right.
I didn't want to be alone.
So here's the question--
Did you come back on
to this show
To kinda redeem yourself?
'cause my fear is that
you feel obligated
To choose somebody,
And I...
Like...
And I'm--I'm scared.
Redemption--
I don't need that.
Mm-hmm.
I don't need redemption
at all.
Okay.
A--can I call you ash?
Is that good or not?
Of course!
Okay. All right. I can
tell you this emphatically.
I'm so much different,
and I'm so thankful to be here.
I'm not gonna waste
your time at all.
Mm-hmm.
I'm glad you're back.
And I'm glad you're happy
and in a good mind-set.
Yeah?
I really am.
Well,
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad I'm here, too.
I have a real good
gut feeling about this.
Mm-hmm.
It's just been so long
since I've just been myself.
Mm-hmm.
And it shows me
a lot about you--
That you make it
very, very easy
For me to open up.
I didn't expect to get into such
a deep conversation with ashley.
I've told her things that
I haven't told many people
In my entire life.
Three years ago, I would not
have answered these questions,
But, I mean, she enabled me
to completely let down my walls.
She makes it so easy.
I feel lighter.
I feel happier.
I feel like I can breathe,
And I give her
all the credit in the world.
I want to have
so many more conversations
Like we had tonight.
I do, too.
So...
Ashley, will you accept
this rose?
Of course, brad.
Please.
Yay!
Thanks so much.
Thank you...
Thank you so much.
For a perfect night.
I feel so great
that brad offered me the rose.
The fact that brad is opening
up to me and really sharing
Some personal experiences
in his life--
It really makes me feel
like he trusts me
And that he obviously feels--
hopefully he feels the same way
That I'm feeling about him
right now.
With all this serious talk,
can we please just go
Jump on the ferris wheel
and go have fun?
Yes! Let's go!
I didn't expect tonight
to go like this.
All I know is
tonight I feel incredible.
I feel happy.
I feel lucky to be here.
I don't want this night to end.
I had so many walls built up,
And tonight with ashley,
All of those came down.
very first date,
And I feel like I'm on my way
To finding my wife.
<i>Coming up...</i>
quiet on the set! Can I
get everybody to places, please?
today we're doing
Public services announcements
to go out and give blood.
Stay away from my man.
<i>ladies, ladies!
What is going on here?</i>
Lick it!
I'm gonna take
advantage of the situation,
Piss all the other girls off.
it really got under my skin.
Michelle walked off set,
and I'm sitting there like,
What the hell just happened?
you take a situation
that's already super-stressful,
Then you throw in
all the extra drama, and it's
Definitely pushing a lot
of girls to the breaking point.
why does
everyone need to attack me?
no, she is psycho.
No, actually,
you are psycho.
I didn't expect tonight
to go like this.
You are nothing like me,
and you never will be.
Thank god.
I need to move.
Thank you.
I will not have you, like,
obstruct the rest of my life.
you have 15 girls.
One man.
You know, this is not
my usual date.
I know.
Today I'm going on a date
with brad...
And 14 other women.
I'm 30 today.
Happy freakin' birthday
to me.
You told me a number,
and you don't look it,
Which is the important thing.
Maybe I'll surprise you.
You know, there's
a lot of competition here,
And I second-guess everything,
And... You know,
I just want him to notice me.
I feel like I have
more wrinkles today.
Pfft. No, no, no. No, no,
no, no. Let me see.
no, I'm just kidding.
Gosh.
you're such a jerk.
happy birthday!
whoo!
happy birthday!
I'm nervous. Today is, like,
a pivotal moment for me
In this whole quest for love,
Because if I don't feel
a connection with brad,
I'm going home,
So I'm gonna bring it,
but I always bring it.
I always bring it, so...
Let's hope it's received.
whoo!
whoo!
let's hit it!
whoo!
oh, look at him!
Look at him. He's so hot.
It's so exciting to go
on my first date with brad.
I can't wait.
I've never been on a date
with 14 other women before,
But I'm ready
to step it up today.
I'd say this is the first date
ever that's had this many girls.
I would be willing to bet
this is a world record.
Hey there. How are you?
Awesome. Thanks, brad.
Hey, ladies. All of you look
so beautiful today,
And I'm so excited to have you
here for our very first date.
So to me, love is a two-way
street. I'm looking for a woman
That can give just as much
as she can receive,
So I picked today to basically
give back a little bit.
We're gonna be donating our time
to a very special organization--
The american red cross.
Whoo!
Great.
Whoo!
Hi, everybody. I'm stephanie
from the american red cross,
And I want to thank you
very much for being here today.
Every two seconds,
Someone in the United States
needs a blood transfusion,
And each donation can help
save more than one life,
And with your help today, we're
hoping to raise that awareness
And encourage people
to give blood.
all right, stephanie.
So today we have
the privilege of making
Several
public service announcements
For the american red cross.
These p.S.A.S may very well be
used as national commercials.
So if you'll come with me,
We'll go right into wardrobe
and hair and makeup.
It's so important
for everyone to give blood.
I love being able
to make a difference,
And the american red cross
is an amazing organization.
It's good to be able
to support a good cause
And do something positive
on our dates.
Quickly, ladies!
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
Gather around, please.
so we get inside,
and it looks like a big studio.
I was so excited.
I couldn't wait.
So when I call your name, please
come up and get your script.
Oh, my god!
We had these skits
that we had to memorize
In, like, five minutes.
I'm the pregnant lady
that's gonna be barging in.
Well, I'd say we're skipping
a few steps there.
I know.
The innocent one.
Mm-hmm.
I'm supposed to be
kinda like a virgin.
Do I really tell you "it's not
bad for your first time"?
I think I do.
I remember my first time
like it was yesterday.
You really remember it?
Yeah. Duh!
All right. Should we go--
hold on a second.
Are they seriously gonna
put me in that outfit?
I'm playing a butch girl
in a neck brace
With two arm casts.
We're all gonna be trying
to fight for his time,
And I think we're all gonna be
really annoyed with each other.
I'm seeing 3-way.
When you say "3-way,"
what do you mean by "3-way"?
Like, the claws are coming
out today. I feel it.
I think we have
a love triangle.
I am the maid.
Nice. A very hot maid.
Do I get to kiss brad?
I don't know. Stacey does.
No, I don't.
I don't get to kiss him?
I am not the cougar.
I am just saying that right now.
Clearly, I am the cougar.
We're here for wardrobe.
Seeing brad
without his shirt on--
I don't think that anybody
was complaining. I wasn't.
he works out a little bit.
I think a lot of us were...
Whew.
madison's costume is the bomb.
She should put on cat ears
and a tail and be catwoman.
As for me,
it was one of those moments
Where I was like, oh, my god.
I'm the butch in the neck brace
and two arm casts.
<i>Keltie--she got stuck
with the worst outfit ever.</i>
lick it.
Crap. Brad's gonna be looking
at me all day and think,
"that girl is the grossest girl
I've ever seen in my life."
I felt so insecure
and self-conscious,
Like I wanted to cry.
Oh, my god. Are you making me,
like, a 90-year-old cougar?
Palm beach.
I live in palm beach.
Do you really?
Yeah.
I am very much looking forward
to my scene with brad.
Look at you guys.
Looking good.
Right?
I am dying to get
one-on-one time with him.
I quit my job to be here.
I left a lot behind for brad,
And I feel very strongly that
if I don't start to feel
Some sort of a connection,
I'm definitely going home.
What are you gonna do here?
I mean, like, are you going
full-on for the kill?
Are you gonna be aggressive?
Here's the thing.
Like, I mean, in normal life,
I wouldn't kiss a guy first.
I'm nervous.
they're gonna be hating
us when we're filming our scene.
I've been competing
in gymnastics my whole life.
I know how to hide my nerves,
but that doesn't mean
I'm not growing ulcers
at an alarming rate inside.
I'm totally thinking about
how everything's gonna go.
The big old smackeroo?
yeah. Definitely.
This is especially irritating,
Because it happens to be
my 30th birthday today.
Not my 29th. Not my 31st.
My 30th.
Oh, my god.
This is gonna be crazy.
Are you gonna give him
tongue?
People are gonna piss me off
today. I know it.
quiet on the set!
Can I get everybody to places,
please?
today we're doing
public service announcements
For the american red cross,
And this is gonna be
really, really exciting.
whoa!
today is all about
putting ourselves out there
In ways that maybe
we never would've imagined,
But it's for a great cause.
We want people
to go out and give blood.
<i>all right, brad! Time to
get into your gustavo uniform.
So today is all about
having fun, trying to act,</i>
But more importantly,
getting the message across.
Wow.
This is really embarrassing.
I hope you know that.
Oh, my god.
is that a happy patch?
I'm dying right now
looking at you.
Gustavo--
he had some serious chest hair.
oh, yeah.
That looks good.
we're going
so far over the top
With this
ridiculous spanish soap opera...
Gustavo!
To prove what giving blood
is not, and that's dramatic.
Your hair looks good.
Thanks.
Yeah.
It's natural.
I have a major crush on gustavo.
I want gustavo.
all right. Stand by,
everyone. Quiet, please!
Speeding. Face out
a little more. And action.
I see the way you look at him.
You're just a servant girl.
<i>You treat him like basura.
He loves me.</i>
<i>Stay away from my man.</i>
<i>I'm not afraid of you
anymore.</i>
<i>Stay away from my man.</i>
Ladies, ladies,
what is going on here?
Gustavo!
Sofia.
Gustavo!
<i>Alexa.
You love me!</i>
<i>No, he loves me!</i>
Ohh.
Gustavo, who do you love?
I love... I love...
Gustavo!
What about little gustavo?
All right. Let's pick it up
from when he comes in the scene.
<i>So how many times do they have
to keep doing this?
You love me!</i>
<i>No, you said you love me!</i>
all right. Stop. Hold on.
<i>There are a lot of takes
in this scene. A lot.</i>
<i>action.
He loves me!</i>
<i>No, you said you love me!
Oh, my god. I'm stuck.</i>
She's messing up on purpose.
I gotta get it right.
If this is
what charity is about,
<i>I'll do anything for charity.
no, you said you love me!</i>
I'm frustrated.
I definitely have to take risks
where brad's concerned,
Because if you don't, you're not
gonna get any time with him.
Who do you love, gustavo?
I just decided, you know what?
I'm gonna break in there,
And I'm gonna show 'em
how it's really done.
Both of you stay away
from him. He's mine!
ohh.
End of scene. Done.
Melissa's acting
a little weird today.
All of us were just like,
is--is she serious?
You leave my man alone!
I think he was really scared.
Had to do it.
Melissa--
she's kinda losing it.
She's, like, laid it out there
that if brad doesn't give her
That time that she requires
today, then she's gonna go home.
Obviously,
she can't handle the heat.
Let's get her out
of the kitchen.
Good job, guys.
Yay!
That's a wrap.
I don't know if I'm gonna give
that a round of applause.
no.
That was a pity clap.
Oh, I'll go
with a pity clap.
Mm. So good, guys. So good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just didn't feel special
at all.
I felt like...
Just another number.
and action.
my daddy says
I should never have to open
my own doors.
I really shouldn't have
to do much of anything.
don't you think?
It's hard to know exactly what
it is that he's looking for.
well,
I don't care what they think.
Bull riding's not just
a man's sport.
He's gonna have to start
narrowing
This list of girls down. I don't
think they've got a chance.
<i>Do you like older women?
Because I love younger men.</i>
A lot of women,
all fighting for one man,
And I don't know if I'm gonna
make it through it.
Lick it!
Check, please.
that was awesome.
All right. Moving on.
ooh, I bet some claws
are coming out right now.
Yeah. 15 on one. I imagine
the girls are fighting
For his attention,
And...
Michelle's feeling down.
I think she's got a plan.
Michelle's annoying.
I don't like her attitude.
She definitely has got
some strategy going on,
And, like, I think she likes
to hold the upper hand.
I think she probably likes to be
in control of the situation.
I really don't have michelle
figured out yet.
I feel like some moments she's
being supersweet to everybody,
And at other moments
she's being a diva.
I mean, you can't expect
special treatment
Just because
it's your birthday.
all right.
We're moving on, everyone!
I'm mortified.
What do you have to do?
Make out with brad
on a bed with chantal.
Definitely not my usual
first kiss scenario.
Okay. I can see
why you're nervous.
Yeah. Plus, I'm pretty shy
to begin with.
I'm kind of a goody two-shoes.
I'm a big old prude.
Go team!
We can do this.
Go vampire scene team!
For the p.S.A. That I'm doing,
we're two party girls,
And we bring this guy back
to our place...
Mercy.
And think we're
ready to have a good time,
But it turns out he's a vampire,
and he wants to suck our blood.
aah!
Our scene is "don't be scared.
We just want your blood."
It's January--
national blood donor month.
I'm super-excited to kiss brad,
But this is certainly not
the circumstances
That I thought I would be under
for, you know, our first kiss.
quiet, please!
Rolling! And... Action.
oh, my god.
That was so much fun!
I just...
I got into the mind-set
That I'm just gonna be someone
completely different,
And if I'm gonna do this,
I might as well go all out.
Ugh. Barf alert already.
Oh, my god, britt.
that's totally...
Oh! Oh, god.
oh, my gosh, britt.
Oh, my gosh.
wow.
Okay.
Really? Really?
ooh!
oh, my gosh!
Shut up.
I was a little
uncomfortable to begin with.
I think we should now be using
the word "nightmare."
Okay, ladies.
Give me one second.
Just wait right here.
I have a quick surprise.
and I'm just, like,
Sitting there going,
it's my birthday.
Open up.
aah!
and so I can sit
around all day and be pissed.
This is not the way
that I thought
I'd be spending
my 30th birthday. Unh-unh.
michelle walked off set,
And I'm sitting there like,
what the hell just happened?
We're helping people decide
whether or not they want
To donate blood,
and it's so important.
I'm like, really? Because today
is her 30th birthday?
It's like, so the drama begins.
britt. I'm shocked.
You guys created quite
the controversy out here.
Michelle's, like, pissed.
I just feel like, you know what?
To each their own.
When I came out, there was
a lot of drama going on,
And all I knew was that
michelle had taken off.
I just feel like
she is creating a scene.
I think michelle was trying
to make a point.
It's her birthday, and she can
cry if she wants to.
Can we talk, please?
Yes.
I didn't know there was
that much drama going on.
I'm the type of guy--
if there's a problem,
I'm going to address it.
I want to clear the air.
Okay, I am sorry,
first of all...
Don't be sorry.
For not being a part of...
The commercial.
I really wanted to do it.
See, I just don't want you
to feel bad, period.
I know.
I want to show you
a good time.
I want to get to know you
so badly. It makes me--
Well, I want you to know
something.
Yeah.
Like, I want
to get to know you...
Okay.
And I think we need to just
continue on this path,
And--and see what happens,
But I wouldn't be here
If I didn't think there was
a connection or something--
Some potential there.
I feel the same way.
So I just want you
to know that.
I wanna show you a good time
tonight, all of us hanging out,
No kissing, no anything at all,
just, I mean, good, clean fun
And getting to know
each other,
So will you at least
allow me to do that?
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.
I would love that.
You okay?
Yeah.
Okay. Okay.
Wanna go back, please?
Yes.
all I want
for my birthday is brad.
I would like to think
that I'm the type of girl
Who knows what I'm doing.
I feel great. I feel good
about being here.
When brad kisses me,
and when I kiss brad,
Fireworks are gonna go off...
Probably right behind us.
I'm excited.
I hope so.
No, I am.
Every girl he kisses
after he kisses me
Is just gonna be
one huge disappointment.
Poor girls.
God, we're always walking into
the party. After you, please.
Oh, thank you.
Ladies first.
Michelle is the type of girl
that knows how to get attention
From a guy.
She definitely seems like
Somebody that is used to having
everything be about her,
And I think that she probably
usually gets what she wants.
So the date's not over yet.
We are going to an after-party
somewhere in downtown l.A.,
And that's all I'm gonna say,
okay?
Please let's have a good toast.
Cheers, guys. Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
I still haven't had
my one-on-one time with brad.
I am ready to get brad alone.
I want to have that interaction
With him,
and I have to get it today.
So please allow me.
Right this way, ladies.
this date was
a lot of fun today.
We gave back a little bit
Working
with the american red cross,
But the night's not over yet.
Okay, so this is
where we're going.
We're gonna have
a little party on the roof.
This will be so nice.
All right.
Whoa.
So all of this is ours--
this entire rooftop.
No way.
This is the perfect environment
for a fun, lighthearted evening.
Oh. (laughs) my gosh.
Check it out.
Make yourselves at home.
Grab a drink.
Let's have some fun.
A lot's happened today.
A lot of drama.
Everyone feeling okay?
Yes!
Relaxed a little bit?
I'm ready to have a lot of fun
with these ladies.
Enough drama for the day.
We're drama-free, right?
drama-free is
the way to be.
Okay.
So let's relax, please.
Let's have some fun and get to
know each other. Cheers, ladies.
cheers.
This is
a really bittersweet situation.
There's 14 other girls here
tonight.
We're all trying to get
his attention.
Of course everyone's thinking
the same thing--I want the rose.
I know there's a rose tonight,
And I want it desperately.
It's your birthday. We'll help
you celebrate, though.
I don't know if you got
the memo, but it's my birthday.
I don't think I'm gonna go
unnoticed tonight.
I can tell you that.
will you guys
excuse us real quickly?
yes.
Do you mind?
Okay. Cool.
I have been waiting for this.
I cannot even tell you
For how long. Like, this is it.
Like, I'm so excited.
You look great.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Please have a seat. Yeah.
Finally having a one-on-one
with brad today.
<i>He is gonna get to know me.
Let's just get the show</i>
On the road.
Like, come on already.
I just wanted to kinda clear
the air and let you know
That I'm not this, like,
wild, crazy, slutty girl...
That's gonna jump in every time
you're kissing another girl.
Basically, I'm very spontaneous,
and after take 342, I was like,
All right, let me jump in there
and just kinda lighten the mood.
How do you think this
is going down here?
afterwards
I actually felt like
I probably shouldn't
have done that.
It wasn't the classiest thing
in the world.
Oh, come on.
She's so, like...
You know how she's been.
surprise
I mean, I think everyone
knew coming into today.
She was like,
"I may be leaving."
I think he's cutting it off.
I think he's like,
"well, it's really great,
like..."
Hopefully we'll have more time.
Thanks so much.
<i>Thank you. I really
appreciate this a lot.
Yeah.</i>
I was shaking during
my one-on-one time with brad,
Because I was so happy,
And I felt
that nervous, giddy feeling
That I don't normally feel,
So... That was definitely
a good sign to me.
Can I steal the birthday girl?
Does anyone mind? Please?
No, I've got plans.
I've got plans tonight.
Happy birthday. Come on.
I'm
in a really awkward situation,
Where I've got
all these ladies
Who are trying to get up
on my man.
15 of us.
When you've got
all these girls fighting
For the same guy's attention--
like, kill me now.
Please have a seat.
Thank you.
Like, let's just cut
to the--like, cut to the chase.
I just wanna, like, connect
with you.
Well, me, too.
I want that, too, badly.
Let me tell you something.
Yeah. Please. Please do.
You have walls.
What?
You do.
What are you saying?
Like, I feel like...
Oh,
this is gonna get good.
Like, I feel like we need
to dissect you.
Like, I feel like
there's so much to you,
And I want to, like...
peel all the layers.
Tell me anything you want to
know. I'll answer it right now.
what's your greatest fear?
Um, I don't want to wind up
alone. I really don't.
I want to find a best friend. I
know that's so clichA©, but I do.
No, I think--
I think that's beautiful.
Yeah?
Right now
I'm feeling really good.
At the end of the night on
my birthday, getting that rose
From brad would definitely be
the icing on the cake.
we had
a great time. That was it.
Just recap. Like, you...
It was just very, like, natural.
I'm very open with my words.
I say what I feel,
and I do not sugarcoat it.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
But while being blatantly
honest, did you tell him that
You were wanting to leave if you
didn't get that one-on-one time?
<i>Um, no. It doesn't have
to be said in those words.</i>
I told him--
but if you're blatantly honest,
why wouldn't you tell him that?
If I am feeling something--
but you didn't tell him
that you were gonna leave
If you didn't have it.
Can you let me talk for two
seconds without interrupting me?
I'm just curious. Can you?
To be blatantly honest.
I think--okay. I-I'm not
usually this girl, which--
This isn't very fun for me.
You are being so fake, so don't
sit here and tell me that
You're, like, trying to act
like this perfect person...
I don't know.
And, like, honestly,
it's seriously childish.
And if I want to put it
in my own words...
Oh, I know what that's called!
I know what that's called!
Then you--do y kw
what I mean? Yeah!
It's called
"lying by omission."
are they being funny
or are they not being funny?
no, they're
actually really fighting.
oh.
What I think is happening is--
because you know that
I love you and all
of your eccentricities.
You act like a 21-year-old.
Like, seriously,
Like, I'm a 31-year-old
talking to a 21-year-old.
Like, you're being
very, very abrasive.
Like, you need to understand
when other people are talking,
They don't have to use the exact
same words that you're using
In your 21-year-old language.
I am 32 years old almost.
You are acting like a child
right now. You are.
Raichel and melissa have it out
for one another,
And they're forgetting about why
we came here in the first place.
I'm generally the one that's,
like, "the beeyotch."
Like, lucky for me,
there's girls like you.
At the end of the day,
I'm totally okay
With raichel and melissa
duking it out.
If you can't accept
what I'm saying,
Then walk away
from the conversation.
Because if you don't like
what I'm saying,
I'm not gonna change it
to make you like it.
The sooner
they kill each other off,
Like, the easier it's gonna be
for me to end up with brad.
date card!
My heart's racing.
I really want my name
to be on that card.
Get in here already!
I feel like not getting a date
this week will suck.
ooh! It's the date card!
I'm scared.
I'm scared, too. My heart.
"jackie, let's get our love
on track. Brad."
Oh!
Oh, my gosh.
it's the best thing ever.
There you are.
You got the one-on-one!
I feel good.
that's exciting.
That's so exciting.
I mean, it's very discouraging
To see, you know,
other girls go on a date
When you haven't
had that opportunity yet.
You feel like a, you know,
really little fish
In a huge ocean.
I'm so nervous and excited,
but really nervous.
are you?
Yeah. I need to catch
my breath. Oh, my gosh.
yay!
I wanted my name to be
on that card so bad.
The fact that it wasn't...
sucked.
so can I talk about
this rose yet,
Because it's kind of staring
at me in the face.
The rose is sitting
on the table,
And I want that rose.
15 girls--it's a competition--
and any girl wants
To be the loveliest
and the most desired
And the one that brad wants
to give this rose to.
A lot's happened today.
A lot has happened today.
I feel incredibly lucky
To spend the entire day
with 15 beautiful women.
It's time to give out this rose.
I know exactly
who it's going to,
And I'm happy to give it to her.
Ah, the rose.
oh, god.
the rose.
The old rose.
Look at all these eyes.
I am here to get to know
each and every one of you--
I promise you that--
But I do have one rose
to give out,
And I want to give it
to someone
That definitely
put herself out there today
But also is very deserving...
On her 30th birthday.
Michelle,
will you accept this rose?
Yes.
Please. Thank you.
Happy birthday,
more importantly.
whoo!
Yeah, thanks for the talk.
When he gave michelle the rose,
I was like, dude, so...
I-I-I felt like I should have
gotten the rose. I do.
Like, I just--I felt like
I was kind of real
Amongst
all the "hey, check me out."
Huh.
Michelle definitely is striking
me as the type of person
Who usually gets what she wants
and is very aggressive about it.
I'm thinking that
she's someone to be wary of.
You know, seeing that is--
it is my birthday,
I got a rose,
And that was what I wanted
more than anything.
I got a rose.
<i>I got a rose.</i>
I feel like I got everything
I wanted for my birthday.
I got a rose.
<i>Coming up...
Oh, my gosh!</i>
I feel like cinderella.
I feel like a princess.
cheers.
I could not imagine
a better date
Than what I am experiencing
right now.
the band, train,
just for you.
this is awesome.
jackie was the perfect
choice for today's date,
But jackie is a cautious one
when it comes to love,
And it scares me.
Can I be honest with you
about one thing?
Mm-hmm.
I'm worried, okay?
I know. I'm here right now,
and I see it.
You're scaring me, though.
emotions are so high
and everyone is so tense.
Why does everyone need
to attack me?
no, she is psycho.
<i>No, actually, you are psycho.
You are like a toxic disease
to me in this journey.</i>
I'm being pulled
in so many damn directions,
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing right now.
hi.
How are you?
Hey. Good.
brad walked in
to pick up jackie,
And he looked smokin' hot.
I'm definitely jealous
of jackie.
I mean, I had to spend my time
with brad with 14 other girls,
And she gets an entire day
of brad.
You ready?
Yeah. I'm ready.
Okay.
I'm so glad I'm here.
I feel so special. I really do.
Jackie doesn't know anything
About what's gonna happen today.
This date is jackie's very own
"pretty woman" experience.
This is beverly hills,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah. So cool.
Just wait.
brad and I pull up
To this elegant hotel
in beverly hills.
Thanks a lot.
All right, you're welcome.
<i>All I'm thinking is
what could we possibly be doing</i>
In this hotel right now?
Please, come with me.
There are guards there
with white gloves,
Opening the doors for us.
Hi. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I'm feeling fabulous right now,
And I feel like
such a special lady
Walking in there,
especially with brad.
It smells like roses.
and I'm not just saying that.
Thank you.
You're gonna go right in here,
to the left.
Okay.
So...
Okay, okay, okay.
So this is just part one.
Get in a robe, please,
and just relax.
This is just the beginning.
Okay? Okay.
Okay. Awesome. Are you
gonna get in a robe, too?
Of course.
A robe is definitely not
something I would ever imagine
I'd be wearing on a first date,
but I don't care.
I'm happy just to be
spending the day with brad,
And I'm sure he looks great
in his robe.
And out of of his robe.
Hey.
Hi. Oh, my gosh.
Look at you.
Uh, look at you.
Look, have a seat, please.
Oh.
today's date is all about
surprise after surprise
After surprise, but it solely
centers around pampering jackie.
Not a bad way to start a date.
No.
It's just the beginning.
Every day I wake up and, you
know, I live a normal life,
And to be treated like this,
I just feel like
I'm out of my element
in such a great way.
So close your eyes, okay?
Okay. Mm-hmm.
All right.
Now keep them closed.
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna lead you in.
Okay.
Okay?
Mm-hmm.
Trust me.
So keep them closed.
What on earth?
Keep them closed.
Okay, so kinda turn and open.
Oh, my gosh!
That's amazing!
Okay, so, okay.
So look, any of this is yours.
Anything.
oh, my god!
This is the last thing
I expected.
Okay.
I open my eyes
to this crazy, elegant room
With so many dresses hanging
up--all for me, all my size.
It's just
the most unbelievable thing
That I've ever been
surprised with.
We have an incredible--
<i>I mean,
an incredible evening planned.</i>
You have all the time
in the world to get made up.
You're gonna look amazing.
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
I'll see you in a little bit.
Okay. (whispers) so pretty.
I'm just, like, floored
That I can take my time here
and pick whichever dress I want
And shoes,
And also knowing that
I'm dressing up for something
But not knowing what--
that is so cool.
I have never experienced
something so magical,
And I definitely feel
my most beautiful right now.
Aw!
this whole experience
has been a lot harder
Than I thought it would be.
I gave up a lot to be here.
hi, mommy.
Hey, sweet girl. Are you
having a good time with mimi?
Yeah.
This is by far,
The longest I've ever spent
away from ricki,
And it's pretty heartbreaking
for me.
Tell me about your first,
uh, cheerleader practice.
I saw your picture,
And you were the prettiest
cheerleader I have ever seen.
Brad does not know
that I'm a mom yet.
It's not that I'm trying
to hide it,
But I'm just waiting
for that perfect time
That I could have enough time
to explain it and, you know,
Tell him how great she is
and tell him the whole story.
I miss you
and I love you so, so much.
I love you, too.
I'll try to call you tomorrow,
okay?
Okay.
I miss you.
It was so hard leaving ricki
at home to come here,
But I feel like it will all
be worth it in the end
If, you know,
I leave here with a fiancA©.
Hi!
You look beautiful.
You look wonderful yourself.
One more surprise.
Oh, my gosh.
oh, my gosh.
So can I help you with this?
I feel like cinderella.
I feel like a princess.
All these dresses, the jewels--
I'm speechless.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Oh!
So look at this car.
jackie was the perfect
choice for today's date.
She's sophisticated,
she's classy, so elegant.
I'm the lucky one here.
I feel like a princess.
you deserve
to feel like a princess.
Brad, why are you making me
feel like a princess?
No, you deserve it.
You're spoiling me.
here's to
an absolute perfect night.
Mm. Thank you so much
for everything and for this.
No. Well, just wait, though.
We're just getting started.
I'll thank you again.
cheers.
Cheers.
I could not imagine
a better date
Than what I am experiencing
right now.
<i>I mean, this jewelry, this
dress, this man, everything--</i>
It would be really hard
to get any better than this.
Wait, wait, wait.
I think we're getting close.
Wait.
What does this sign say?
The hollywood bowl.
What's that say?
I can't read it. Under the--
oh, my god! Stop it!
stop it!
Oh, my god!
So it's--
I love it. So--
You are--
that is ridiculous.
I just got even more excited.
Oh, my gosh. Seeing my name
up there with his name--
That was crazy.
that was crazy.
Your name's in lights,
literally.
This is one of the most famous
live music venues
In all the world.
The beatles have played here,
Elton john, jimi hendrix,
You name it--
and tonight, it's all ours.
oh... My... Gosh!
We're gonna eat dinner
there?
Looks like it.
I've heard
of this place,
But I never thought
that I would be here.
It's amazing.
It's perfect.
It's picture-perfect.
So here is
To what I hope is...
As close to a perfect day,
as possible, for you.
<i>I'm glad that you--
thank you so much.</i>
You're very welcome. Cheers to
it not being over yet, okay?
Yes.
Cheers to that.
I like that, too. Cheers.
I really want that rose.
If he's feeling the same way
that I am,
Then I would be
the luckiest girl in the world.
What kind of kid were you
growing up?
You know, I wasn't popular by
any stretch of the imagination.
Really?
No.
Did you date much? Were there
high school boyfriends?
Um, one high school boyfriend.
Proms? All that?
<i>And I didn't date at all
in college, actually.
What?</i>
I mean, I-I dated,
I guess,
Like, I went
on a couple of dates, like...
Yeah.
But I never had a boyfriend
all four years.
Wait, w-w-w-wait.
Okay.
is that weird?
You made
a conscious decision...
Mm-hmm.
Not to date in college?
I don't know why--why--
I mean...
Okay.
Um, yeah, I had that boyfriend
in high school for a year.
Mm-hmm.
And the only other person was
that other guy that I dated.
Two guys all your life? Two?
I-I'm--now I'm afraid
that you're afraid of me.
<i>You can have any guy you want--
no doubt about it--</i>
But you've only had
two serious relationships
In your entire life.
You clearly pick
The men that you're with...
Mm.
<i>Extremely carefully.</i>
I'm very cautious.
jackie reminds me
a lot of myself
When I was here last time.
I've said a million times
I came here a different man
And I came here to fall in love.
I'm concerned
that jackie might wake up
And realize that this is all way
too much of a risk for her.
This process
Almost forces us to throw
caution to the wind, okay?
You're concerned about that?
Yeah, of course.
Mm-hmm.
It's just--yeah, it's a concern.
At the end of the day,
This is very real.
This is real life.
I know. I'm in it and I see it.
Okay. So no games.
You better be in it.
I'm in it. I'm here right now,
and I see it.
Yeah?
You're scaring me, though.
Obviously,
there's a rose tonight, okay?
Um, may I?
This rose...
Can I be honest with you
about one thing?
Mm-hmm.
Okay. I'm worried.
I learned a valuable lesson
last time
About not putting myself
out there...
Right.
And I'm worried if you can,
But... The very first night
that I met you,
You got out of the limousine
with a permanent smile.
You have this glow
about you.
You opened up to me right away,
which I really appreciated.
So I'm willing
to hang in there
If you're willing
to hang in there. Okay?
I'm willing.
Do you wanna give
this thing a shot?
I do, as long as you want to.
Okay. Jackie, will you
accept this rose, please?
Yes, I will.
When brad asked, "jackie,
will you accept this rose?"--
It was surreal.
It was...
I felt so special.
I felt like he wants to give me
that shot and give us a shot,
And that felt very good.
Jackie is a cautious one
when it comes to love,
And it scares me a little bit.
With that being said,
Who am I to judge? I mean,
that was me three years ago.
So I'm willing
to give this a chance,
I'm willing to be patient,
Simply because she's just
an incredible woman.
What if I said
I have one more surprise?
huh?
what would it take
to make this day better?
What about...
The band, train?

<i>If you'd like to date</i>
<i>The next bachelor

<i>Go to bachelor.Abc.Com
and click "apply."</i>
I feel like a brand-new man
From the last time
I was the bachelor.
I-I really do. I feel like I am
truly embracing this experience.
In fact, already, I have had
some really good conversations
And some
really strong connections,
So going into
tonight's cocktail party,
I'm feeling comfortable,
feeling good,
Feeling confident.
So I just want to get in there.
I want to talk to those women.
hi!
How's everybody doing?
Good. How are you?
I'm good.
You know what's really cool?
It feels like I'm walking
into a room full of friends
Instead of strangers.
No, I'm serious. You know...
aw!
The first night--let's face it--
it was a little awkward
For all of us, right?
So we're all on the same page?
So with that being said,
I can't wait to use tonight
To get to know each of you
better. Let's have fun. Cheers?
cheers.
Cheers. All right.
It's good to see everybody.
you, too.
I just need two minutes. Two.
Oh, okay. You got it.
Will you excuse me?
Before we're even done toasting,
Michelle goes up
and steals him away.
Okay!
people looked pissed
Because on the group date,
Michelle had
two one-on-one times with brad,
And now here we are, you know,
the night of the rose ceremony,
And she's pulling him away
first thing again.
Michelle's got a rose.
What is she doing?
Well, maybe she has
something very pressing
She needs to ask him
right away.
Do you prefer starbucks
or the coffee bean?
Are you serious?
100%.
Um, I'm a starbucks guy.
oh, my gosh.
Good answer.
Yeah? Okay,
I passed one test.
yes.
Second question.
Okay.
What is always stocked
in your fridge?
Um, what is always stocked
in my refrigerator?
Eggs, turkey, and water.
You, too?
Minus the eggs.
Match made in heaven.
they've had
quite a bit of time together.
they were together
at the shoot
And they were together
at the pool.
there's certainly
An escalated feeling
of competition in the house...
Well...
Because tonight is
potentially the last night
For a couple or a lot of girls.
Who knows?
So how was
your guys' conversation?
It was really good.
I just had, like,
random questions for him.
what'd you ask him?
I asked him if he prefers
starbucks or the coffee bean...
Mm-hmm.
And then I asked him what items
he always has stocked
In his fridge.
You're being serious? That's
really what you asked him?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I thought you were
being a smart-ass.
Oh, no. I really did.
I think michelle
is pretty ridiculous.
I mean, I am absolutely here
for brad, you know,
And I want to fall in love,
More than anything
in this world, and to be honest,
I don't really care
where he gets his coffee.
Uh, the other day, I learned
a little bit about you--
Quite a bit about you...
Mm-hmm.
And it made me realize
You're really, honestly
looking for something real.
Mm-hmm. Absolutely.
But as far as, like,
the other girls go,
Especially, I'm just
a little bit more private.
Yeah?
And it'll take a little bit--
a little while
For me to completely open up
and be an open book, you know,
But--
I-I will be as patient
as I need to be.
I really will. I'm serious.
Thank you.
I'm very flattered.
Uh, well, no, well,
um, well, I mean it.
Uh... You make me lose words.
I feel like an idiot
talking to you. Uh...
Like, I'll be honest, the first
night, like, I saw you--
And this is gonna sound
so cheesy--
Um, but I was, like,
super intimidated.
You are, like, a really,
really good-looking guy.
Well, thank you.
I know you heard that,
But I'm just so grateful
to be here
And I'm even more grateful
that it's you.
Okay, well,
I can't tell you...
I can't tell you how good
that makes me feel.
I appreciate you saying it.
I feel like this cocktail
party could not be going better.
Not only do I feel such strong
connections developing,
But everyone just seems happy.
Honestly, like, you're rude.
I am rude?
Like, you've been rude to me
since day one.
It's, like, be real with me.
Like, you're being so fake
And everybody else sees it
but you.
Okay.
Raichel and melissa have
kind of been going at it
For a couple days now,
and now here we are,
You know, the night
of the rose ceremony,
And it's like,
"really? Here we go again."
you are nothing like me
and you never will be.
Thank god is
all I have to say.
Let me tell you what,
melissa.
I'm not gonna entertain you
with conversations.
Nothing about you
entertains me.
Yeah, good.
So can you walk away?
No, I'm perfectly happy here.
If you're not happy here,
You can walk away.
No, you girls need
to start talking to me
'cause I can't talk to this.
This is--this is, like,
Freaking me out.
I don't know.
I don't want to get involved.
No, I'm not getting involved.
I-I don't want to talk to her.
I think emotions are so high
And everyone is so tense.
People start to snap.
Especially when you're fighting
for the same guy.
I'm telling you,
I was calm until you came up.
No, you attack.
Because every time
I talk to you, you dissect
everything I say,
And you say that I'm
contradicting myself...
Do you know what?
Let me tell you something.
Every time I talk,
and that's really rude.
I will not have you get in
the way of the rest of my life.
How am I
getting in your way?
So you either walk away
or you keep your mouth closed.
You have a choice.
I don't have to do
either of those.
We're not in high school.
I don't have to walk away
Or do what
you're telling me to do.
I need to move.
Thank you.
I will not have you, like,
obstruct the rest of my night.
I need somebody to just talk
to me right now.
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Tell me.
I want to (bleep) punch melissa
in the face...
Why?
And I never thought
I would be this girl.
What's wrong? I mean...
Like,
I'm here to fall in love.
Did y'all just have, like, a...
Oh, she, like, came up and was,
like, just hyper tonight
And she's freaking me out.
I've been calm, like, all night,
And the second she walks up,
I was like, "excuse me."
craziness.
Like, "I don't even want
to be associated with you.
You are like a toxic disease
to me in this journey."
yeah, but you know what?
Here's my thing.
Calm down. It's not worth it.
If she comes over here, I'm
walking away. You need to leave.
You need to leave.
...You need to stop.
She wasn't.
No, she was attacking me.
somebody get her away
from me. She is psycho.
She was just--
<i>No, actually, you are psycho,
thank you very much.
No, no. Shh. Melissa.</i>
Listen. Worry about yourself.
If brad sees you doing this
right now, it's not attractive.
I came over there,
and she attacked me.
Melissa, I don't care.
You take a situation
that's already super stressful,
Such as a rose ceremony,
and then--then you throw in
All the extra drama,
and it's just--
It's definitely pushing a lot
of girls to the breaking point.
what's going on?
I've been being
attacked for a week straight.
I'm so tired of it.
it's so frustrating.
And I never cry.
What did she talk to you about?
No, what happened was
Raichel came in,
and she just started saying
Melissa kinda, like,
jumped on her outside.
And melissa came up
and was just like,
"I just wanna tell you
right now
Everyone says, that,
raichel, you're poison."
Like, I have done nothing
but be honest,
And she keeps attacking me,
and I don't know why.
Everything I say,
she, like, dissects it.
"why are you hyper?
Like, oh, you're o.C.D.?
You're this, but you're that."
like, why? Why does she have to
Dissect everything I say
and be such a bitch?
Is she that jealous? I don't
understand it. (sighs) crazy.
you just gotta rise
above it. Let that be her issue.
Jesus does love me.
And that's why I will stay
and she will go,
'cause the lord knows better.
I think that this whole process
Not only brings out
people's true colors
But also brings out the crazy
in them
And every little thing
that is negative.
oh, you guys...
Brad doesn't know that drama
has been stirred
And the emotions and the crying
between melissa and raichel,
So I think it's definitely
gonna catch him off guard.
Hello.
Hey.
How you doing? Eye roll.
Did I--yeah.
Not so great. I didn't roll
my eyes, did I?I didn't mean to.
Oh, wait. You're--
you're not doing so great?
No. I'm having
a really hard evening.
Okay. Let's hear it.
Please, have a seat.
Thank you.
it's really hard
to get me at my breaking point,
But I'm there.
God, you're crying. You're--
I'm there. I'm like...
Okay, come here.
Please hug me real quickly.
oh, I want to watch this.
oh, they're rubbing
the back.
Okay, so what's going on?
Well, it's just been
really hard being, like,
I don't know how else
to put it other than
I am the targeted girl in
the house for whatever reason.
Okay.
And for this whole week,
I've been being, like,
Attacked by one girl
or another.
he's gotta be
shooting himself inside.
I don't know, but he keeps
doing the look away,
Like, "someone come save me."
yeah,
he's got to be like, "help."
she's a ticking time bomb.
What do you think it's about?
Well, there's one girl
that's been targeting me,
And basically,
I feel like she's--
okay. Let's hear it.
Who is it?
It's raichel. I feel like she's
sucking the life out of me.
Okay.
She's just, like,
such an energy suck.
Like...
I'm sorry.
I had onions in my pizza.
I feel like--
I'm, like, so emb--
I'm, like, embarrassed
that I... (laughs) sorry.
No worries.
No onion breath, I promise.
No.
Sorry. I know. I was like, gosh,
I shouldn't have had that onion
And peppers and everything
on my pizza.
And I had four slices.
anyway...
Okay, sounds good.
Sorry. But, um...
Um, but from the day
that I got here,
Raichel has been literally,
Like, pulling the positive
energy, like, out of me.
Like, she's draining me.
And I feel like I'm just here
for--to find somebody
And for love, and it's just
really hard being that girl...
that's, like,
constantly being attacked.
Tonight melissa is going through
a little bit of drama.
In fact, she's actually crying.
I don't like seeing that at all,
And I'm gonna try to get
to the bottom of this.
You're crying.
come here, please.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no. Oh, come here.
What's wrong?
I just, like,
need to hug you really quick.
Now raichel's
talking to brad.
Do you think raichel
is talking to brad
About her spat with melissa
and that was...
I've been having
A little bit of technical
difficulty with melissa.
Yeah.
Um, it's definitely been
taking a toll on myself.
She basically has
just been, like--
Like just popping up
everywhere I go,
So tonight I was kind of sitting
and chatting with the girls,
And she just walked up out of
nowhere and was like, "I'm so,
Like, da, da, da, da, da,
and I'm not normally like this."
mm-hmm.
<i>It's like, well,
what are you really like?</i>
I don't want to get you
wrapped up in, like,
The she said/she said,
But I just want you to know
that this is the last thing
I expected
on a rose ceremony night.
Like, I wanted to look beautiful
for you and, like...
You look beautiful regardless.
Don't--hey, don't cry.
but I'm
so sorry. I'm just so...
Come here, please.
Give me a hug again.
I'm sorry.
It absolutely breaks my heart
to see any woman cry,
And I have two women
crying tonight.
I thought that everything was
going great,
But then all of a sudden,
a switch is flipped.
Raichel is telling me one thing.
Melissa is telling me another.
I don't know what to think.
Why does the conversation
always stop when I get here?
It should continue, right?
hello, chris.
Well, hello there.
Good evening.
good evening.
It's not time
for the rose ceremony...
whoo!
But there is something very
important I want to deal with.
Some of you had some very tough
questions about why he's here,
His sincerity, is he true?
And correct me if I'm wrong,
But the guy's passed
with flying colors, right?
So let's turn the spotlight
around.
What about you all?
Who's here for
the right reasons? Who is not?
So we thought brad could use
some help figuring this out.
So, ladies,
I'd like to introduce you
To a couple of friends--
ali and roberto.
Hey.
Since ali and roberto have been
through this process before,
They'll be really good judges
In knowing who's here
for the right reasons.
But that's not all.
With their help, brad will also
Be handing out a rose
at tonight's cocktail party.
So, ladies, you can see
what's on the line here tonight.
Emotions are running high
because not only
Do we have ali and roberto here,
but we also have that rose.
So it's really important that
he sends home the right girls,
The people that aren't here
for the right reasons.
I messed up before. I won't
mess up again, not at all.
That's why I'm begging you--
I mean, begging you to help me.
oh.
yeah.
I actually was like,
this is good
Because brad doesn't get
to see as much,
So they'll be able to relay
to brad who's real.
We'll help out and we'll do
the best we can, man.
Thanks, man.
Absolutely.
Thank you so much.
a lot of drama this evening,
And it's clouding my judgment.
That's why I'm so relieved
That ali and roberto are here.
Hopefully they can help me
figure out who's here
For the right reasons.
out to the fireplace.
Let's go.
Our interrogation room,
as we like to call it.
Familiar surroundings.
Along with ali and roberto
Getting a chance
to talk with each of us,
There's also going to be a rose
that's handed out
Before we even get
to the rose ceremony.
So at this point in the game,
that's huge,
Because it stands
for someone that is here
For a true and right reason,
that not only brad sees,
But that ali and roberto
also see in you.
hey.
hi.
Hi. How are you?
Ali and roberto were actually
going to be talking
To each one of us girls.
And of course, we're all like,
"oh, my gosh. What are
they gonna ask us?"
okay, quick questions
we're gonna ask you.
Bring it.
Okay, age.
I am 30.
I just turned 30, yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
happy birthday.
Thank you.
So tell us about yourself--where
you're from, all that stuff.
Um, I'm from dallas, texas.
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Um,
I'm a first grade teacher.
So what brings you here? Why'd
you get involved with this?
Well, I'm kinda constantly
the third wheel
With all my friends,
and I'm really shy, so...
My girlfriend was like,
"you should just go
On 'the bachelor.'" I was like,
I should go on 'the bachelor.'"
And so then I went home
and I signed up.
How do you feel about brad,
like, being here,
And this whole situation,
and all the other girls
Kinda being there,
going for the same guy?
I had no idea it was gonna
be this hard. I-I really didn't.
Oh, yeah.
It's difficult.
And I think fighting
over one guy with 20 people,
It's really tough.
I really certainly hope
that melissa should go home.
And--and here's why--
Because she's not
being authentic
And she's not being real,
And tonight, she definitely was
not true to who she was.
So that's why I hope
that she goes home,
Because she blatantly lied.
From the day that I got here,
she's been attacking me.
Then just walk away.
I can't do it anymore.
right. We don't
want to get involved.
are we still
talking about this?
From here on out,
just don't--don't even...
Then just say "okay"
and put this behind you.
Don't do it.
If anyone has been through what
I'm going through right now,
It would be ali.
Hey.
hi.
it's really important
for me to talk to them tonight
And get them on my side.
How are you?
I'm okay.
What's wrong?
I don't think
I can even talk...
What's wrong?
what's up? Tell us. Why...
I am that girl in the house
That's just been targeted
this week.
And it got so bad tonight
with raichel.
Okay.
I honestly--if it weren't
for that man sitting up there,
I would go home so fast,
but, like...
I'm over the drama.
I just want it to stop.
I want to be able to focus
on why we're here
And not keep seeing
people crying. It's exhausting.
And I really highly doubt
that he wants a girl
That is--is doing
all those things.
Give me a thumbs-up
or thumbs-down--raichel.
Melissa. Okay.
I don't really care what--if she
says one thing and does another.
But I feel like
she has a very hard time,
Like, separating herself
from the drama.
She's kind of going around
and just creating it herself,
And I feel like it's
a destructive presence
To have in the house.
Mm-hmm.
Appreciate your honesty.
Yeah. Yeah, we really do.
It's so nice to meet you.
It was awe--I'm so glad
I got to meet you guys.
You guys are adorable. Thank you
very much. See you later. Bye.
Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.
Take care.
I'm really excited to sit down
with both ali and roberto
To find out what their gut
feeling is amongst these women.
Who's the most sincere?
I'm anxious.
How are you?
How's your night been?
It's good. It's been--
yeah?
Yeah, it's good. A lot of very
bold personalities, you know?
Please, please help me.
yeah, we got you, man.
I think you got
a lot of great girls.
Yeah.
And we're gonna give you some
insight. It's just our opinion.
Thanks, man, very much. Okay.
There is one rose sitting out
on the table tonight,
And it's pretty much
based off of,
Um, brad's conversation
with ali and roberto
And their opinions of all of us,
And, um, I think
everybody wants it.
My time with ali and roberto--
I feel like it was really good.
I'm really hoping that my true
colors, like, showed through,
And that they'll suggest that
brad give me the rose tonight.
I can't thank you two enough.
It means a lot.
Of course. Anytime.
Yeah, we're just...
We hope we helped
a little bit and, uh...
It helped.
With their help,
I am 100% confident
In my choice
of who to give this rose to.
hello.
hi.
hi.
Well, hello there.
Oh, the rose.
Oh, the rose.
Emily, will you come with me,
please?
Do you mind?
Can I steal you real quick?
aw!
mm.
The collective "aw."
So sweet.
Excuse us real quick, please.
ohh.
So I think...
I don't know
what it is about you.
I think you have, um,
An extreme amount of class,
sophistication.
I've wanted so badly
to believe
That you're here for me
and only me.
Uh, talking
to ali and roberto both,
Your name was one of the first
that came up...
Really?
With believing
that you're genuine.
Thank you for telling me that.
It means a lot to me.
Uh, well,
it means a lot to me, too,
<i>That you are here
for the right reasons,</i>
And I want to get to know you,
So if and only
if you'll accept this rose,
Um,
I'd love to give it to you.
So, emily,
will you accept this rose?
I would love to.
I am beyond flattered
that brad chose me,
Um, to get that rose tonight,
And I'm just really excited.
It really, um, made me
feel really, really special,
And I'm really grateful.
Hey, guys.
hello.
Well, this time,
I am breaking up the party.
It is time
for another rose ceremony.
So, brad, if you would,
come join me.
good luck, brad.
Excuse me. Uh, well,
thank you very much.
I need it with this group. It's
a tough group tonight, man.
We're fine.
We're not--we're fine.
I know this day
has been tough on you,
So thanks for hanging in there
with me. It means a lot.
So I do have a tough decision to
make. Please excuse me, ladies.
Thanks.
I feel like melissa's going home
because she is
Psycho and totally unstable
and shouldn't be here.
I want a rose tonight.
I want to stay.
But if raichel gets a rose,
and I go home,
It would just be a tragic shame.
Ladies, good evening.
Good evening.
It's been quite a week.
You started to get to know brad.
You started to go on the dates.
But I also know things have
kicked up a notch
Here in the house.
I think it just goes to show
How serious and how emotional
this process is going to be.
So tonight,
second rose ceremony.
Ashley h., michelle, jackie,
and emily--
The four of you have
already received roses.
Nothing to worry about
tonight.
As for the rest of you,
13 roses to hand out.
Three of you
will be going home tonight.
I wish you all the best.
And if you're ready,
here's brad.
thank you.
Whew.
It's been a long night.
I wanted to sincerely thank
each and every one of you
Just for your patience.
I can't imagine what each of you
are going through,
So thank you for hanging
in there with me.
This week, I can honestly say
I have made
stronger connections
In one single week
than I did in a full month
The last time
I was the bachelor.
It's a great feeling for me.
So I hope you guys are
feeling something, too.

When you're ready.
Thanks.
Britt.
Britt, will you please

I will.
Thanks.
Ladies, I'm sorry.
If you did not receive a rose,
Take a moment,
say your good-byes.
Good luck.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Nice to have met you.
It was nice to meet you, too.
I really--swear to god--
If they gave out an oscar
for worst dater ever,
It would go to this girl.
I'm the worst.
I'm just so awkward.
Honestly, I don't know if love
is in the cards for me.
I think I'm maybe
meant to be alone.
this was kinda like...
My last-ditch effort.
'cause I've done,
like, the regular dating,
Then I've done
the dating people at work--
That never works out well--
And then I did the being set up
by people that I know,
And then I did
the online dating.
So...
Kind of exhausted
all the avenues.
I think that I'm gonna stick
to kickin'.
Way easier.
It was so nice to meet you.
Good luck.
Nice to meet you as well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think there are several girls
who targeted me,
And they needed
to push me over the edge
So that it was one less girl.
and that sucks because,
Like, I'm a really nice person
and...
I guess... You can't be friends
with everyone, right?
So...
I had a really hard time
in this house,
And it's just a shame because...
I don't feel I deserved it.
How you doing?
Bye.
Thank you.
nobody likes
to be in this position.
You feel rejected.
It sucks, you know?
I feel like I do deserve better
Than, like, standing here
crying right now.
I feel like I deserve to be,
Like, smiling and laughing
and talking with brad.
I don't feel like I should be
sitting here, upset.
And if I continue
to be this way,
That means that melissa won.
I came here to fall in love.
I came here to fall in love.
I didn't come here
to get so upset by another girl.
And the part
that makes me, like,
The most frustrated about
this whole thing is that,
You know, I-I tried
to put myself out there,
And--and it just...
This wasn't my--
this wasn't my time.
Long night, but great week,
And incredible chance
to get to know all of you.
Let's make next week
even better.
We have all the time
in the world,
Actually get to know
each other, have some fun.
Here's to another amazing week.
Okay? Cheers, ladies.
<i>next week on "the bachelor"...</i>
Oh, my god! Jeez! Wow.
we are about to film
an action/adventure movie.
nothing is gonna stop
me. (bleep) going down today.
michelle definitely
marks her territory immediately.
We were having
a private conversation.
I turn around,
and she's, like staring.
none of these girls
are right for him. He is mine.
Here we go.
dbaby, I compare you d
dto a kiss d
I apologize, mr. Seal.
dbaby,
I compare you to a kiss d
I can already feel myself
Starting to fall for brad.
dla-da-da-da d
it's scary to put yourself,
In, like,
such a vulnerable position.
I found out that, um,
The plane had crashed.
Nobody had made it.
I'm not sure if emily
is going to be able
To tell brad
about her situation.
I'm really worried.
Guys I have dated have shut down
once I tell them about my past.
I don't know
what's going on here.
<i>oh, god.
Where is she going?</i>
will you excuse me
real quickly?
I want to go home.
<i>It's all coming up next week
on...</i>
keltie, do it.
Do it right now.
