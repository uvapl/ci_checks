Now she wants wall-to-wall
carpeting in the living room.
1200 crowns per square metre.
Two years ago we had the
same floor sanded... for 20000!
It makes my stomach ache.
And she tries to get the
bathroom wallpaper to peel off.
She'll probably want Italian tiles,
specially imported.
We never repapered when we were
little. We moved the pictures around.
Don't you remember
when we painted my room light blue?
And where did you get that paint?
Reefer-Steve stole it, right?
I panic when I think about
how much it costs.
- It's like it has to be expensive.
- But Marika is paying, right?
Yeah, and she drives a car
she paid half a million for.
Half a million! For a car!
We could take some time off
to be with the kids.
But she prefers a luxury car
to strengthen her credibility...
...as a real estate agent.
- Take it easy!
Can't you talk to her?
No, you'd drop two grand
on some odd jacket...
My God, what traffic!
Get in, mom. We're supposed to be
at the airport in 45 minutes.
- And your hat?
- I'll put it on at the airport.
Yeah, it's not a hit. They should
find something else for you.
Close the door.
Wait, I need to make sure
I remembered my wallet.
Do you know who I bumped into?
Magda, your class-mate.
Good-Iooking man with her!
And she was pushing a baby carriage.
It's Krister.
I picked up your medicine.
Don't we have that in the cupboard?
Of course I'll take care of it
for you, my darling. Kisses!
- I have to buy prunes for Krister.
- I have to drive Nina to work!
- It'll just take a minute!
- You could walk.
- Up that hill?! It would kill me!
- Then take the bus.
- I'll take a taxi.
- But I promised you a lift!
- She'll take a taxi.
- I told her I'd drive her to work.
- A taxi is more comfortable.
- Why change what we said?
To activate the flow of oxygen
pull the mask toward you.
Place the mask over your mouth and
nose, adjust, and breathe normally.
Put your own mask on
before helping children and others.
You gentlemen look like
you could use a drink.
Will you marry me?
Don't forget to let your
"equipment" down before landing.
Don't forget about tomorrow.
We may not work together
for several months now.
No, but I might be working
with your wife.
Have you developed morals
all of a sudden?
Morality isn't much fun.
That pilot is so scummy!
It matters more than you think
spreading your legs for a jerk.
You have to raise your standards
when it comes to men.
Compare it to buying a new skirt.
Only the best will do
for a star like you.
- Gunnar, you can be my life coach!
- I already am.
I think you ought to start
some kind of therapy.
Find out why you're so scared of
getting involved with a decent guy.
And find out how to cut the umbilical
cord still attached to your mom.
It's hard for me
to meet the right guy.
But I don't see what that
has to do with my mother.
I can keep her in place.
- There's a purser course in the fall.
- I've only been flying for 13 years.
Would you please waitjust a moment?
13 years, 15 years, it doesn't matter
if you're good. Apply.
Sweetheart, I've been trying
to reach you on your cell.
But that answering machine
keeps picking up.
Call sweet little mama
when you get home.
Hi, Nina, we're planning a
couple's dinner next Saturday.
But you can come, too.
Hi there! I just wanted to see
how you're doing.
Well, I'll speak to you later. Bye!
Hello, darling, it's mom.
Linus, Marika, and the children are
coming over, but will you be back?
It's your brother. Marika and I
would like you to baby-sit-
- on the 18th, during the day,
and the 24th...
- Hi, mom.
- My darling, are you home?
You have to come here right away!
- Do we have everything?
- Linus, the children are afraid...
Now Nina's here, so stay.
I have ice-cream for the kids.
As long as he refuses to apologize
there is no way we're staying.
Am I not even allowed
to give my grandbabies a hug?
Would someone please tell me
what happened?
- Krister threw a peach at Sigrid.
- Hard, at her head.
Linus, please. Mom gets so upset.
One thing's for sure: Krister is
not coming to Sigrid's birthday.
He can't hit her in the head
and then be invited to her party.
It will only upset the children more
if they see you crying.
What is your schedule this week?
We need to shop at Bauhaus-
- and we can hardly ask your mother
to baby-sit as things stand now.
- I won't be home before the weekend.
- What a shame!
Hello, Marika here.
Oh, what bad luck...
- Did they leave?
- Yes, they were already in the car.
It would have been awkward
to get the kids out of the car.
- Why do they take the small car?
- The Company makes them.
- Krister is making me Irish coffee.
- Even assholes have their uses...
I suppose our little air hostess
will want one, too?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Linus is so sensitive.
He's always been like that.
Dr. Phil says you shouldn't let
sensitive people have their way.
He's lost his sense of humor.
That's the problem with that doormat.
Don't you want to stay with us?
Nina's here now.
Your family conference
interests me zilch!
Sit down, mom.
He does get upset
even if he doesn't show it - really.
I don't think it's a good idea for
Krister to come to Sigrid's party.
- Did Linus say that?
- No, it's only my opinion!
They can sit and rot in their snooty
neighborhood by themselves!
But I want to see my grandbabies!
You go! It's my ugly mug
they can't stand to see.
I don't want to go by myself.
- Krister bought a coffee cake!
Here, this is for you.
It's delicious. Just like the one
I brought from South Africa.
Thank you.
At least Nina has her act together,
even if she doesn't have a boyfriend.
The purser is in charge of the cabin.
Which means?
More responsibility, flying longer
routes again, a greater challenge.
She wouldn't encourage me to apply
if she didn't think I'd get in.
Of course you'll get in,
no problem!
If you promise to wear
that uniform on Saturday.
You're so embarrassing.
Of course I will.
- Hey there! Great outfit.
- Isn't it?
I want you to meet Marcus,
we grew up together.
- He hasn't been out for a while.
- Want me to warm him up a little?
Marcus, I'd like you to meet
one of our regulars. Nina.
Hi!
- So, Jens and you grew up together.
- Yes!
Jens said you haven't been out
for a while.
No.
Let's go to your place.
I have a son, William.
- How old?
- Five... and a half.
Is he at home?
No.
Ow!
I only have light beer.
Hey, you, could this be someone
who also lives in this apartment?
Yes, that's William's mother.
She died four years ago.
But it's alright, don't worry.
Come here.
Our mouths fit nicely together.
Our bodies just might
fit nicely together as well.
Shit!
I don't want to be like this.
- You're wonderful and I'm drunk.
- Me too.
I want all of me to be here,
with you.
We don't have to have sex.
I just want to kiss you.
Can you guess
where I slept last night?
What, are you serious?
That is so great, totally insane!
- Why hook me up with this Marcus?
- I don't know.
You're a great girl, he's a
great guy. Wasn't it any good?
Yes, it was...
...just a little different.
He's not exactly my type,
so it took me by surprise.
It might be good for you to know...
His life has been hell. He lost both
his parents when The Estonia sank.
And then... I don't know
if he told you anything...
Yes, he told me his girlfriend died.
So, he's had his ups and downs. But
whenever you meet him he's positive.
And I'm always impressed by that,
he's a strong person.
So he needs to meet
fun people like you.
- Are you going out again?
- I don't know.
What does he do for a living?
He evaluates work-related injuries
or something like that.
If he calls me and wants your number,
can I give it to him?
I'll let you decide.
- Hello, hello!
- Hello, mom!
- Where's the birthday girl?
- She's in the back yard.
Something for us grown-ups.
Krister wanted to taste it first.
You know him, he's like a little boy.
Oh, look.
Didn't they already have a new car?
Hello, hello!
Come on, try and reach it!
Krister, let the poor dear
have her present!
Come on!
OK, here. It's yours.
Where are you going
on vacation this year?
- Linus, where is Nina?
- She's on her way.
- He reeks of alcohol.
- He wouldn't dare show up otherwise.
A peach!
Now you throw it at me
and that makes us quits.
- Hi, am I late?
- My little darling!
Oh my,
your skin looks terrible today!
And you have expensive creams!
Don't they work?
Hello!
You don't need make-up,
you're pretty the way you are.
Isn't my little girl just beautiful!
- Don't I have a beautiful daughter?
- They aren't deaf, mom.
Goddamn kids!
Isn't Krister in high spirits!
Playing with the children.
- We'd like to see that new study!
- Krister fell!
- It wasn't my fault.
- Yes, it was!
Let go!
Come here.
You get out of here right now!
I don't want you here.
Humour. Do you even know
how to spell the word?
I'm leaving, nada problemas.
No skin off my back.
It's your mother who makes me
go to all of her stupid parties.
Linus, aren't we supposed
to be having a nice time?
Congratulations!
Nina, get Krister.
Show some consideration for
the children! Stop being so selfish!
Time for some birthday cake!
- Alright, are you ready?
- Yes!
What a lovely cake! - Krister!
We're in for a little turbulence,
hang on tight.
- Were you scared?
- No!
- Good. Juice, water?
- Juice!
Hi.
I'm at a birthday party.
Now?
I must be off in a minute.
Daddy, come here!
Would you like some coffee?
No baby-sitter! If you're wondering
why I brought William...
No, no...
- Have you lived here a long time?
- Since William was born.
I'd like to move, but...
- Do you want a sandwich?
- Only if it has cucumbers.
- Yes, one with cucumbers.
There you go.
- How did his mother die?
- She was hit by a car.
She didn't think she was hurt,
so she just came home.
She died during the night.
- At home?
- Yes, in the bedroom.
- Daddy!
- Yes?
Is it time for "Bolibompa" yet?
Yes.
Come! If you aren't doing anything?
Why are you laughing?
His pants.
- How long have I been asleep?
- About a half hour.
- I need to be getting home.
- Oh, yeah? Yes.
- What! He fell asleep?!
- Yeah.
It means he trusts me,
that he can relax with me.
It sounds disturbed.
One thing's for sure.
He doesn't play any mind games.
There's no guesswork.
He's like an open book.
Or, that's his game,
to play the open book.
Please be a little more cynical.
We've gone from frivolous to serious,
have we? Please, my darling man-eater
Just because a single father gets
bulk rate discounts on funerals-
- he's not the most wonderful person
in the world.
Nicest guy I've met in a long time,
anyway.
It's pretty weird, bringing his kid.
He needs to control his horniness
before it starts to affect his kid.
We haven't even had sex yet.
"Can't we just sleep together? It's
so nice just to be near each other."
It was my suggestion.
Now I really am getting worried.
I want to go home. Even our extra
night in Rome has lost its appeal.
- You can call him from the hotel.
- No! We hardly know each other.
Tea? - Tea?
Do you travel 230 days a year?
You've barely been at home.
I haven't really had any incentive.
- That's a lot.
- But I love flying, this life.
The freedom, and the way
we all work together.
Making each flight nice for
the passengers, seeing new places.
Besides, I love working in uniform.
I want to travel, too.
- I would, if I didn't have William.
- But take him with you.
He isn't too young. You should
travel, if that's what you want.
He said he thought you were fun.
William?
He usually doesn't say
anything about anyone.
- Have you had many relationships?
- Hardly, with this job.
You know, what you said about
not being drunk when you have sex...
Let's just say...
It's been a long, long time
since I've had sober sex.
Not unless you count
being hung over as sober.
So I haven't really had a chance
to establish a relationship.
I'm here, on Sickla Canal Street.
If you ever want to have sober sex.
Always sober, always at home.
Wish you were here...
I am. I'm with you, right now.
Daddy...
Come on, let's go to bed.
- Why aren't you in your bed?
- I was just talking to Nina.
Marcus!
Get dressed, I'll make breakfast.
We're late for daycare! - Hi!
We can look in the shop windows
without getting depressed-
- about being broke, because
true pleasure lies in just looking.
I've met someone.
Oh, now I understand
why you look so tired.
- Are you in love?
- Yes, I think so.
"Think." That doesn't sound good.
He has a little boy.
I think he likes me, too.
Can you fix the strap? It's twisted.
What about his mother?
These things can be very sensitive.
She's dead.
Don't end up comforting some man
who's only looking for a babysitter.
He isn't looking for comfort
and he would never let me baby-sit.
- Does he have any money?
- He's not a millionaire.
What would have happened to us
if I hadn't met Krister?
Single mother with two kids. You two
weren't always easy to deal with.
And not one word from Arne.
Well, how do I look?
I think it looks nice.
If you like, I'll buy it for you.
Poor you. This is what your body
will look like one day.
Not too expensive, anyway.
Have you talked to Linus?
He never calls me back.
I want to meet
my darling little grandbabies.
I'd like you to meet William,
and Marcus.
The best thing about this car is that
you don't have to order any extras.
It comes fully equipped
with all the latest features.
The only thing you have to consider
is what kind of personality you want.
This is one absolutely great car.
Go ahead and get in, have a seat.
They live here on the first floor.
- Hello! This is William and Marcus.
- Hello there!
Well, William, this is my mom.
Yes, that's me,
I'm Nina's little mom.
Hello.
- Why did you hang up that?
- That's my beautiful daughter!
Look at her! So pretty!
- Any news about the purser course?
- No.
- Nina, will you get the potatoes?
- Yes.
So, you and your little boy
live all by yourselves.
You're lucky to have met Nina.
So responsible, and she's got money.
- Mom!
- Well you do, don't you?
If I didn't have such a rich and nice
little girl I'd look like a bag lady.
Krister said I looked
like a scarecrow in this.
No! There...
- I want to go.
- The other children will come soon.
What a shame that Krister is away
at a soccer game.
Yes...
- How old is William?
- Five and a half.
- Where did you say you lived?
- Hammarby Sjöstad. It's a rental.
Lucky for you!
The condos aren't doing very well.
- Mom, do you have a tablecloth?
- Oh, are we having a formal dinner?
- Of course!
- One, two, three, four...
- How old are yours?
- Five and seven.
- He doesn't have a mom.
- No, she's dead.
I don't have many tablecloths.
Will this one do, you think?
- Yes, that'll be very nice!
- It'll have to do.
Oh, what a lot of people.
I'll open the balcony door.
- He seems very special, anyway.
- Marcus?
Yeah... a real warning
for psychopaths.
He seems like a great guy!
I can take care of this. Go sit with
your boyfriend. Take off his clothes.
Nina has a boyfriend!
Cut it out!
- And just what is going on here?
- You're worse than the children!
You're so lucky!
Almost 35 and you meet a single guy
who already has a kid.
You really hit the Jackpot.
You can relax for a couple of years.
Then pop out a brother for William
just before you turn 40.
Perfect planning.
He must be aware of it every day.
That his mother is dead.
It happened a long time ago, he
probably doesn't even remember her.
It's much nicer when Krister
isn't here. Linus is so calm.
It's his therapy.
Hasn't he?
I happened to mention
you're seeing a shrink.
How was I supposed to know for once
you haven't told your sister?
It's money well spent.
It's something that benefits us all,
if you feel good.
- Hello out there!
- Hi, you want a drag?
Oh, delicious!
Krister hates it when I smoke.
- What a nice dinner you made, mom!
- Did you like it?
Oh, I'm so glad
when you and Nina are both here.
When I'm with both my children
under the same roof... I'm happy.
Boooo!
Is the game over already?
They were playing so badly
I couldn't take it.
Aren't you going to say hello
to Nina's friend?
- Time to go?
- Yes, let's go.
We've had such a good dinner.
The children got dressed up and...
What, are you leaving?
Yes, it is rather late.
Krister is not feeling well. It's not
easy for him with so many people.
- So, really, it's good if you go now.
- I see.
Hotdogs have got so expensive.
They want 20 crowns for one!
Used to have two for that price.
How hard can it be
to grind up a couple of pigs?
My damn legs were tingling
the whole time.
It's on the front page,
did you see it?
No.
Tingling legs are a common complaint.
I thought I was a little special.
Mom would never have made it
without Krister.
- We were difficult, Linus and I.
- He seems nice, your brother.
Marika told me
he's started going to therapy.
I hope he has a better therapist
than the one I was sent to.
I wonder what it would have
been like, if I had had siblings.
Someone to share everything with.
Anyway, my family is a lot better
when you are there, and William.
Good.
I don't have a mommy.
I don't have a daddy.
Did your daddy get hit by a car?
No, my daddy lives in Germany.
He doesn't want to be my daddy.
Not even when I was little.
You know, your mommy
really wanted to be your mommy.
It's better to have a dead mommy
who wanted to be your mommy-
- than to have a live daddy,
who doesn't want to be your daddy.
Maybe we could sleep at my place
one night this week.
I don't really have many options
when it comes to babysitters.
It's a little sensitive. We've been
sleeping so well at home lately.
William is so sensitive.
Go and change your clothes
or you'll scare the kids.
I do want to.
I'd like to have time with you alone,
I really do.
I have to think of William.
A few months ago he was having
nightmares almost every night.
I feel like I'm exposing him
to too much too soon.
It might even be good for him if...
...we take a break.
- I don't have nightmares!
- But what is it, William? Calm down!
William!
I don't have nightmares!
I don't have nightmares!
Good, good, very good, excellent.
All right, hang in there.
Just four more.
Four, three, two, one, zero
and don't stop. Stand up!
Just a little bit longer
and we're home free!
Fasten your belt by inserting
the metal tab into the buckle-
- and release
by pulling up the metal flap.
We recommend that you keep your
seatbelt fastened while seated.
In the event of cabin pressure loss,
oxygen masks will be released.
To activate the flow of oxygen
pull the mask toward you.
Place the mask over mouth and nose,
adjust, and breathe normally.
Please, call...
Well, look who's here!
You can'tjust disappear with one
of my buddies without coming by.
One whisky sour.
Want to go out dancing tonight?
- Hello!
- Hey.
- Were you sleeping?
- No.
Can you come over?
We're taking a break.
Please try to understand,
it's for William's sake.
I'm so afraid
he'll get too attached to you.
I'm attached to him.
Will you come?
Sometimes I don't understand
why I do or say certain things.
You are really good for me.
And now, I really do have to
go to the bathroom.
It's your brother,
I left a message on your cell.
I just wanted to have a chat,
so... call me!
Hi!
I live here.
- There aren't any ghosts here.
- Not one?
No.
Do you think it's nice here?
Come and see what I have.
You have so many.
This is Petra, isn't her dress
pretty? I think this is really nice.
Do you have any Barbie dolls?
Hugo, have you been to a girls'
party? - His fly is open.
I'm going to cook some
batter pudding with blueberries.
The open house starts at eight,
and I'm home by nine.
And please, please, please, please
let the kids be asleep by then, OK?
Nina hasn't called for a week.
I've left her messages
but she doesn't call back.
That's the same treatment
you give your mom.
She doesn't have time
for you anymore.
She probably spends her time
at home screwing.
How long has it been
since we've had sex?
Three months.
Longer.
Then shouldn't we go do it?
Now?
Yes.
But you can'tjust say,
"Let's have sex."
Then when will we have sex?
Well, not on command, anyway.
The kids...
"Bolibompa."
Does this have anything to do
with your therapy?
We'll soon come out.
I'm just helping Nina with something.
- Hello?
- This is Jill, is Nina there?
They're in the bathroom.
I have to watch "Bompa" now. Bye!
Oh? Hello?
Hello!
- Hello!
- Give it up!
- They haven't hung up.
- You hang up then!
- I wanted to talk to Nina.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
The batter pudding is ready!
You look different
since you met this guy.
- Your face has got rounder.
- Thank you!
Well, it's a good thing
that you're eating well.
Mom, sometimes you say
really crazy things.
Be happy you're in love in any case.
Not everyone is able to.
Take good care of him. He's been
through so many horrible things.
You'd better not travel all the time.
Be there when he needs you.
He doesn't seem to have
a problem with my working hours.
Well he should!
Mom...
I just think it's so wonderful
to see you in love.
That my little girl is in love.
The only one I ever loved was Arne,
and you see where that got me.
Jill Maria Frisk.
I mustn't forget to tell you where
I put my will, if I'm going to die.
This is an obligatory mammography
that they do on all women.
My daughter is coming with me.
She might be a boss soon, purser.
You know what Krister said:
No way I'm coming with you
to a titty x-ray inspection.
Please back up a little.
Why do you stay with Krister?
Without me
he'd drink himself to death.
And now the right breast.
He just makes you nervous
when he drinks.
Linus barely wants to see you
because you always bring Krister.
Please back up a bit.
How would that look
if I went by myself to see Linus?
Krister would see
that they don't like him.
Then he would drink even more,
and then... he isn't always so nice.
He can get really mean,
but you don't see those things.
You can get dressed now.
I'll come and tell you how it went.
Where would I live?
It's his apartment.
I don't have any money and I don't
want to spend the rest of my days-
- in a one-room apartment, living
on welfare, watching TV alone.
It's better to live with someone...
There's something going on, anyway.
You know we're here for you, if you
want to make a change in your life.
You're never home.
You're worthy of someone who
takes care of you, is kind to you.
It would be such a shame
if you never had that.
The doctor has seen the images
and everything looked good.
So they're OK then, my breasts?
No garbage floating around in there?
No, they looked very good. And you
can stay a few minutes if you like.
Mom...
Let's be off then!
Now I want to have a pastry.
I've been thinking all day
about having a pastry.
- Nina.
- Hi!
You were accepted into the course.
Didn't you get the letter?
- No, I haven't been at home.
- Youngest purser ever, a pioneer!
- Hi!
- Nina!
Hi!
Guess what I have for you?
- Look what I got!
- Ice-cream.
I got into the course for pursers.
Youngest person ever.
Congratulations, did you really?
That's wonderful.
I told them no.
I'm going to quit flying
after the summer.
I'll work at the airport instead.
I won't be traveling any more.
- We're about to start traveling.
- To India.
I found some great tickets,
so we'll be leaving in three weeks.
We'll be gone for half a year.
- Is Nina going, too?
- No, we'll see her when we get back.
Yes!
I hope you didn't say no
to the course for my sake.
It's like you said,
William can handle more than I think.
We need to get away,
experience something new.
Do I even exist in your life?
Because you do in mine, all the time.
I want to change my life for you.
It's the biggest thing I can offer
and I want to give it to you.
You have never...
Are you in love with me?
Because if you are, I really need
to hear you say so right now.
- I don't know...
- What did you say?
I don't know.
Then do me a favor and don't call me
until you've figured it out.
Where's Nina going?
I'm so awkward,
so utterly awkward.
Stop it, stop, stop!
You aren't awkward,
you're just crazy about...
What? Some Mary Poppins fantasy,
I make myself sick!
They made me feel important,
like part of a family.
Why was I so stupid and asked him,
started making demands.
Why couldn't I just let it be the way
it was? That was good, wasn't it?
They've arrived.
I don't know what his problem is
but something is wrong-
- when he doesn't tell you
he'll be away for six months.
William... I really care about.
What are you going to do?
Fly, I just want to fly.
Ow!
Toot! Toot!
Toot!
Say "toot" once more and you won't
be on this plane when it takes off.
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, where are you?
Copenhagen.
- Um, things aren't so good.
- Is anything the matter?
Marcus and I... We broke up.
- Well, I told you so...
- My battery is about to go...
I'll be home on Thursday
and I'll call you then.
- May I help you?
- Yes, thank you.
I won't sit next to such a sick boy.
I have my voice to consider.
- I'm sorry, the plane is full.
- Not at all.
There are plenty of seats
in business class.
I'm sorry, you should have thought of
that when you purchased your ticket.
Do you know who I am?
Just one moment!
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I please have your attention.
A passenger on board
doesn't know who she is.
If anyone recognizes the woman
please contact the crew.
What? Are you out of your mind,
for God's sake?
Fine, OK fine,
what an idiot, damn her.
You're Arja Saijonmaa.
Go whistle for your wife, you coward!
Unfaithful asshole!
Wait!
I told you there was something
strange about that guy.
He loses his family, his wife,
and is still so happy all the time.
He was like: "I feel fine,
no problems here at all."
- I have to believe what he says.
- Believe what he does instead.
He's going to India.
For six months.
I see, and there's a ticket
for you, too?
Well he sure seems like
a guy in love...
Must you always be so hard?
I'm not your friend because
I go around kissing your ass.
- Why don't you answer your phone?
- It's broken.
Please don't be sad. My children
can't be sad. Then I get sad.
Oh, well, I don't remember your
apartment looking like this.
I remember it as being much bigger.
Oh, honey, he'll be back soon.
Men want to prove that they are
independent even though they aren't.
They like to take off for a while
so that you get worried.
- I don't want him to come back.
- Oh, yes you do.
You're so in love that I want to
find someone to fall in love with.
But he's not in love with me.
I can't be with someone
who can't even say he wants me.
Go there, and he'll regret everything
when he sees how pretty you are.
Now you're behaving like Arne, he
also throws things when he's upset.
I hate Arne.
This is all his fault.
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- Good!
- Stop!
- "Stop, stop, stop!"
- Nina.
- "Nina, Nina, Nina"...
Don't open it!
I'm hungry.
Have something to eat
and all will be well, you'll see.
- Is everything OK?
- Yes.
I'll take another one of these.
This is a nice place.
Nina, do you come here often?
My darling boy, do you want
something to eat as well?
No.
- How are you? - What's going on?
- He doesn't want her, that man.
- Come on, turn on the water works!
- No teasing now!
We're supposed to be comforting her.
Get going so we can go home!
- How can you say such a thing?
- Leave her alone.
God damn drunk...
What are you mumbling about,
do you need oxygen?
God damn drunk.
Nina, that's not a nice thing to say.
You ruin everything.
Did you know that?
She says, as she stares at her plate,
when her mother treats her to dinner!
- Drunken sod.
- What the hell do you mean by that?
You're drinking away
my mother's life.
None of us think you're nice
when you're drinking.
Don't you realize how much
she has sacrificed for you...
How much she's done without,
just so you can go boozing.
Krister!
Mom.
Mom!
It's up to her. If she chooses to run
after him we have to accept it.
We can't do anything about it.
How can she? She's our mother.
I don't think we ever really had
a mother. We have a... Jill.
She's always put Krister before us.
We might as well accept it.
He's always come before us.
He's more important than we are.
We don't even have a father.
No wonder we're so... fucked up.
You can have the number to
my shrink if you like. He's good.
I got Marika to give up wall-to-wall
carpeting in the living room.
We can paint the floor
if she wants something different.
How are you?
I just wonder
if I'm ever going to meet someone.
Maybe Marcus was just a... warm-up.
One day you'll meet a man
who is really messed up.
Yeah. He was just depressed
and self-absorbed.
Soon you'll meet someone truly
insane, who suits you perfectly.
- You said he was a great guy.
- I didn't say that.
- I said he was a psychopath.
- No, you didn't!
- You're the one who's psychotic.
- Psychotic?
I may be a little nervy, like mom,
but I'm no psycho.
Psycho...
That's it!
No, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
You're the psycho. Turn down a
greatjob for a guy you hardly know.
- Who said I turned it down?
- You said you were done with flying.
- You're allowed to change your mind.
- Why can't you settle for something?
- You've never settled for anything.
- I have.
- You haven't.
- The wall-to-wall-carpet.
