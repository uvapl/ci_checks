I <i>DON'T</i> KNOW.

TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
UM, DAD, I'M ABOUT

SO YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE ME.
[sighs]
- WE'RE NOT WASTING TIME.
WE'RE JUST KIND OF--
- WE HAVE A PLAN.
- WE'RE JUST SITTING AROUND
DOING NOTHING--
- THIS IS THE PLAN.
I KNOW.
WE JUST GOT TO GET
BACK ON THE TRAIN.
- OKAY, LET'S GO.
- WELL, YOU WANT TO ASK SOMEONE?
- I DON'T WANT TO ASK ANYONE.
I JUST WANT TO GET GOING.
LET'S JUST...

I HEAR VOICES.
I JUST NEED TO--SWEETIE,
YOU STAY HERE WITH MOMMY.
I'M GONNA GET US OUT OF HERE,
OKAY?
SOMEONE'S GONNA
GET US OUT OF HERE.
- THIS WHOLE TUNNEL
COULD COME DOWN.
[metal banging
and gravel clattering]
- OH, THANK GOD.
ARE ANY OF YOU A DOCTOR?
- SHE MIGHT BE,
BUT SHE ONLY SPEAKS SPANISH.
- HEY, THAT'S FINE.
MY WIFE AND KID CAN TRANSLATE.
COME ON.
HURRY.
- WAIT, ARE YOU A DOCTOR?

PLEASE! PLEASE!
HE CAN'T WAIT.
PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

YOU'RE NOT A DOCT--
HEY, HEY, HEY.

SHE'S A NURSE.

- SHE CLEANS HOUSES.
THANK YOU.
- IT'S OKAY.
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.
WE WERE ON THE RED LINE.
ALL RIGHT?
- THAT ACCIDENT
WAS AN EARTHQUAKE.
YOU GUYS DIDN'T FEEL THAT?
- THESE TUNNELS SHOULD WITHSTAND
A 7.5.
IF THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE,
IT WAS A BIG ONE.
- HERE.
LET ME TRY.
- ONE, TWO, THREE.
PUSH.
- IT WASN'T AN EARTHQUAKE.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- THE SMELL.
IT'S LIKE FIREWORKS.
UNLESS THESE TRAINS
RUN ON GUNPOWDER,
I'D SAY A BOMB WENT OFF.
- WHAT?
- LIKE A TERRORIST BOMB?
- NO, NO, NO.
WE CAN'T SAY THAT FOR SURE.
STOP FREAKING EVERYBODY OUT.
- THREE TOURS IN IRAQ.
I KNOW THAT SMELL.
- OKAY, WHATEVER.
JUST GET HIM OUT.
[all grunting]
- SHIT.
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.
WE NEED TO FIND
SOMETHING STRONGER.
- WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUT, OKAY?
- THANK YOU.
- [coughing]
- IT'S OKAY, ADAM.
I'M RIGHT HERE.
- YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
BABE.
SAY IT.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
- I'M GONNA BE FINE.
I'LL BE FINE.
[sobbing]
- IF WE HAD SOME KIND OF WRENCH,
WE COULD TAKE OUT
THE WHOLE SEAT.
- I SAY
WE JUST BREAK THE DAMN THING.
- OH, AND BREAK HIS SPINE TOO?
- IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU,
I'D PREFER
YOU NOT BREAK MY SPINE, THANKS.
- HEY, WE NEED SOME MORE HELP
BACK HERE.
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- SHE NEEDS MORE SUPPLIES
TO CLEAN HER WOUNDS.
WE NEED RAGS, ANYTHING.
- I HAVE ALCOHOL.
- GREAT.
LISTEN, COULD YOU TAKE THEM
TO HER?
I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.
- OH, DUDE,
IT'S RAINING CONCRETE OUT THERE.
- HEY, I'M COMING WITH YOU.
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
PLEASE.
GET ME OUT OF HERE FIRST.
- MY WIFE CAN'T WAIT!

ON GETTING HIM OUT,
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- YOU COMING?
- YEAH, YEAH.
GONNA NEED SOME LIGHT.
- IT'S JAMMED.
ON THREE.
ONE, TWO...
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE CAR.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE REST OF THE TRAIN?
- HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.
ALL RIGHT, FOLLOW ME.
- OH, MY GOD.
- LOOKS LIKE
THE TRAIN NOSE-DIVED.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT GETTING OUT THIS WAY.
HEY.
HEY.
THIS WAY.
COME ON.
- HEY.
UM, YOUR DAD SENT ME OVER
WITH THESE SUPPLIES.
HE'S LOOKING FOR HELP RIGHT NOW,
OKAY?
HEY, I'M TORI.
- THANK YOU.
I'M KRISTINE.
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, DILLON.
YOU KNOW...YOLANDA, IS IT?
- YOLANDA, <i>SI.</i>
- WHOA!
LOOK AT THE FLOOR!
- IT'S COMING FROM OUTSIDE.
- IN HERE!
- HEY!
HELP US!
- DILLON?
- WE NEED A DOCTOR!
- DILLON.
- DAD?
- IT'S US, SWEETIE.
CAN YOU SEE THIS LIGHT?
DILLON!
DILLON, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- YEAH.
- THERE WE GO.
- THANK YOU.
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD.
THE PRESSURE'S
BEGINNING TO EASE.
OH.
- HEY.
SO THE GUYS OUTSIDE
MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY OUT,
BUT THEY NEED YOU.
- ME?
- YEAH.
COME ON.
- WAIT.
YOU'RE GOING OUT THERE?
- WE HAVE TO.
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, MAN.
I SWEAR.
- NO WAY.
THEY CAN'T NEED ALL OF YA.
- ALL RIGHT, THIS WAY.
- NO.
- GUYS, COME ON.
- COME ON.
COME ON.
HEY, WATCH YOUR STEP.
- OVER HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
ALL WE NEED'S THE LITTLE GUY.
- HOW IS THIS A WAY OUT?
- DOWN HERE.
THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL
IF IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH,
THOUGH.
- I MEAN, IT'S TOO TIGHT FOR US.
BUT, UM, MAYBE...
- YOU WANT ME TO GO IN THERE?
- WAIT, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT GOES ANYWHERE?
- LOOK.
- A LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
HEY, LOOK, IT MOVED.
- YEAH.
I TRIED CRAWLING IN
AS FAR AS I COULD
AND CALLING OUT,
BUT NO ONE ANSWERED.
- HEY, LISTEN, UM...
I DON'T KNOW; MAYBE YOU CAN
GET IN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER.
I WOULDN'T ASK, EXCEPT--
- I CAN TRY IT.
- NO, NO, NO.
NO.
NO, I'LL GO.
I SHOULD GO.
- NO, NEITHER OF YOU SHOULD GO.
IT'S A DEATH TRAP.
- MORE THAN OUT HERE?
- NO, I CAN--I CAN DO IT.
IT'S FINE.
I MEAN, THEY'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO MAKE A MOVIE
ABOUT THIS SOMEDAY.
RIGHT?
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO PLAY THE HERO.
- GOOD LUCK.
- HEY, YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS.
- OKAY, WATCH YOUR STEP.
WATCH YOUR STEP.
- HEY, SO WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- BOYD.
BOYD MILLIGAN.
- YOU'RE AN ACTOR, RIGHT?
- YEAH.
YOU--YOU RECOGNIZE ME?
- I SAW YOU READING A SCRIPT.
- OH.
RIGHT.
- BUT I--I'M PRETTY SURE
I RECOGNIZE YOU FROM SOMEWHERE,
LIKE, A--LIKE, A COMMERCIAL
OR SOMETHING?
- YEAH, IS IT
THE ONE WITH THE GUYS
DRESSED UP
LIKE THE SOLAR SYSTEM?
- UH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU WERE ONE OF THE PLANETS,
RIGHT?
- RIGHT, I WAS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE STILL RUNNING THAT ONE.
- SO WHICH PLANET WERE YOU,
BOYD?
- URANUS.
YOU KNOW, IT--
[creaking noise]
IT'S GETTING PRETTY TIGHT HERE.
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE.
- SHH.
[crash]
- OW.
- BOYD?
- I THINK I SAW A SPIDER.
[grunts]
AH!
AH!
- BOYD, YOU ALL RIGHT?
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I JUST--I JUST GOT
A LITTLE CUT.
- COME ON.
KEEP GOING, BOYD.
JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER.
- I THINK I FOUND A WAY THROUGH.
STAY IN CHARACTER.
BE THE HERO.
PRETEND LIKE YOU'RE NOT
SHITTING YOUR PANTS RIGHT NOW.
IT'S GETTING BRIGHTER.
- GOOD, GOOD.
- I MUST BE CLOSE.
HELLO?
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
- WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S A FRICKING COMPUTER.
THERE'S NO--
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO.
I DON'T EVEN THINK
I CAN TURN AROUND.
[rumbling]
AH!
- BOYD!
BOYD, COME BACK!
- STAY BACK!
- BOYD!
BOYD, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- COME ON, BUDDY!
ARE YOU THERE?
- ANSWER ME!
- COME ON!
- BOYD!
- HE'S GONE.
- DID YOU FIND A WAY OUT?
- NO, I DIDN'T.
THE TUNNEL COLLAPSED,
THE ACTOR IS DEAD,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE STUCK HERE
TILL THEY DIG US OUT.
THAT'S MY PACK.
- IT'S MY FAULT;
I ASKED HER TO GATHER
ALL THE BAGS AND PURSES.
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE
FOR A WHILE,
WE MIGHT NEED TO RATION
WHATEVER SUPPLIES WE FIND.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
- IT'S A GOOD CALL.
- YOUR BOYFRIEND?
I'M SORRY.
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON MY WIFE.
- DAD?
DID YOU FIND A WAY OUT YET?
- NOT YET, BABY, BUT...
DADDY'S GONNA GET US
OUT OF HERE.
I PROMISE.
- THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.
- FASTER.
WIND FASTER.
- [grunts]
OH, THANK YOU.
OH, TH--
- SHE WITH YOU?
- YEAH.
THAT'S MY WIFE.
I DIDN'T REMEMBER
THAT SHE WAS EVEN ON THE TRAIN.
SHE'S--
SHE'S CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
SHE NEVER COMES ON THE TRAIN.
PLEASE HURRY.
HURRY.
- COME ON.
COME ON.
- THANK YOU.
BABY?
BABY.
OH, GOD.
- [speaking Spanish]
- DAD, PUSH HARDER.
- [cries out]
IT'S OKAY.
- HEY, HEY, I GOT SOMETHING.
COME HERE.
- OH, MY GOD.
IT'S LIKE A WHOLE HOSPITAL
IN THERE.
- WHY WOULD YOU LOCK
A FIRST AID KIT?
- THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
I'M GOOD AT LOCKS.
- WHAT IS IT?
- ANOTHER BOMB.
- IT'S AN I.E.D.
A BIG ONE.
WE GOT 12 MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DISARM IT.
- THAT'S A REALLY BAD
FIRST AID KIT.
- OH!
[groans]
- HEY!
MISTER!
- NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.
- WE NEED YOU BACK HERE.
- I SAID NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME!
- I KNOW,
BUT IT'S LIFE AND DEATH.
HURRY.
- DAD.
I GOT IT.
- WHAT IF THERE ARE MORE?
- NO.
WHEN THERE'S MORE THAN ONE BOMB,
THERE'S USUALLY ONLY TWO.
I TEACH HISTORY.
IT'S NOT AN UNCOMMON TACTIC.
THE FIRST BOMB, PERVERSELY,
DRAWS A CROWD,
AND THE SECOND...
- LET'S MAKE SURE.
CHECK EVERYTHING.
CAREFULLY.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH, MY GOD.
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAVE
SOME <i>HURT LOCKER</i> SKILLS.
- I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WE
SHOULDN'T MESS WITH THIS THING.
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MESS WITH IT AT SOME POINT.
ALL RIGHT?
SO WHAT IF WE, UM...
PUSH THE STOP BUTTON
ON THE PHONE?
- WHAT IF THE STOP BUTTON'S
A FALSE TRIGGER?
- WHAT IF WE PULLED BOTH WIRES
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME?
- NO, NO,
I SAY WE CLEAR THE TRAIN,
GET OUT OF HERE.
- AND LET IT GO OFF?
THIS TUNNEL CAN'T TAKE
ANOTHER BLAST.
I WOULDN'T POP A BALLOON
IN HERE.
- WAIT, WHAT ABOUT PUTTING IT
IN THAT LITTLE TUNNEL?
WHERE BOYD IS?
- YEAH, YEAH.
NO, THAT'S GOOD.
IF WE GET IT FAR ENOUGH,
IT COULD ABSORB
MOST OF THE SHOCK.
- HELL, NO. MY WIFE IS
RIGHT BESIDE THAT TUNNEL.
- THEN WE MOVE HER.
- THAT WOULD KILL HER TOO.
- BESIDES,
IT'S STILL AN ENCLOSED SPACE.
PRESSURE WAVE
WON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO.
- I VOTE
THAT WE ATTEMPT TO DISARM IT.
NOW, WE'RE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE.
WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.
- NO.
- WHY IS IT IN A FIRST AID KIT?
- 'CAUSE IT'S PERFECT CAMO.
YOU COULD MOUNT IT
RIGHT ON THE WALL.
- YEAH, BUT IT WASN'T
ON A WALL.
IT WAS IN A BAG.
WHAT IF THE PERSON WHO DID IT
IS STILL HERE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE A SUICIDE BOMBER?
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
LOOK, THERE'S A TIMER, RIGHT?
THAT SHOWS THE BOMBER INTENDED
TO BE MILES AWAY
BEFORE THIS THING WENT UP.
- YEAH, INTENDED.
BUT WHAT IF THE FIRST BOMB
WENT OFF EARLY?
- YEAH.
YEAH, A SYNCHED BLAST,
THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE.
- WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE THING
ABOUT A FIRST BOMB
DRAWS A CROWD?
- YEAH, BUT HOW DO YOU DRAW
A CROWD IN A COLLAPSED TUNNEL?
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
DID YOU--
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE BOMBER
COULD STILL BE ON THIS TRAIN.
- WHICH MEANS HE'S DEAD...
OR ONE OF US.
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
- IF HE'S ALIVE
AND WANTS TO STAY THAT WAY,
HE BETTER SPEAK UP.
- [laughs]
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
WOULD THE MASS MURDERER
JUST PLEASE STEP FORWARD, HUH?
- WHAT IF HE ALREADY TOLD US
HOW TO DISARM THE BOMB?
- WHAT, ME?
- YOU JUST SAID,
PULL THE WIRES AT THE SAME TIME.
- YOU ARE SHITTING ME.
- HE WAS OFFERING SUGGESTIONS,
OKAY?
AND SO WERE YOU.
- YEAH.
BUT I DON'T LOOK LIKE
A TERRORIST.
- YOU THINK I'M MUSLIM?
DUDE, YOU ARE WAY OFF.
- LISTEN, LET'S JUST NOT
GET CARRIED AWAY, GUYS.
- NINE MINUTES.
- LOOK, IF I'M WRONG,
I'M SORRY.
BUT MOST TERRORISTS
DO LOOK LIKE YOU.
- I'M MUSLIM.
AND MY FIANCE IS--WAS TOO.
- I AM NOT SAYING
IT IS DEFINITELY HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS.
WE'RE ALL SUSPECTS HERE,
INCLUDING ME.
BUT WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME,
AND WE BETTER START
PLAYING THE ODDS.
AND THE FACT IS, MOST TERRORISTS
ARE YOUNG MEN
OF MIDDLE EASTERN DESCENT.
- OR PASTY-FACED
MILITARY PSYCHOS.
OH, WE HAVE ANY OF THOSE HERE?
- THAT'S YOUR NAME?
- DUDE, YOU ARE WASTING TIME.
- THEN TELL ME YOUR NAME.
QUICKLY!
- AL.
- AL WHAT?
- QAEDA.
HERNANDEZ.
IT'S BRAZILIAN.
- BUT YOU DON'T SPEAK SPANISH?
- BRAZILIANS SPEAK PORTUGUESE,
DUMB-ASS.
AND MY NAME IS FROM BRAZIL.
I'M FROM MICHIGAN.
HERE.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?
HERE.
ALBERTO HERNANDEZ.
BORN IN GRAND RAPIDS.
I OWN A SNOWBLOWER,
AND I ROOT FOR THE PISTONS.
CAN WE DISARM THE BOMB NOW?
- COME--THIS IS NOT GETTING US
ANYWHERE. COME ON.
- WE HAVE EIGHT MINUTES.
- I FOUND SOMETHING.
ENGINEERING BOOKS,
MOSTLY ON SUBWAYS, TRAINS.
- OH, HEY, MAYBE THERE'S
AN I.D., ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
THERE'S PICTURES.
THERE'S TUNNELS AND STATIONS,
OKAY?
IT'S ALL OF L.A. METRO.
THIS--THIS HAS GOT TO BE
THE BOMBER'S, OKAY?
- IS IT YOURS?
- NO.
- [gasps]
- WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S YOU.
- I'M NOT THE BOMBER.
I SWEAR I'M NOT, OKAY?
I'M NOT THE BOMBER.
WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA!
- WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
- FROM THE COP.
- NO, NO, NO, PLEASE.
I'M--I'M NOT THE GUY, OKAY?
I'M DOING MY MASTER'S
AT USC, OKAY?
OKAY, TRANSPORTATION
ENGINEERING.
MY THESIS
IS ON THE NEW WILSHIRE LINE.
I SWEAR. I PRACTICALLY LIVE
ON THESE TRAINS.
- BEFORE, YOU SAID PULL
THE WIRES AT THE SAME TIME.
IS THAT TRUE?
- IT WAS A GUESS!
- TELL ME!
- I DON'T KNOW!
- IS THAT THE TRUTH?
- LOOK, I'M NOT THE--
LOOK, STOP HIM, ALL RIGHT?
I'M NOT THE ONE HOLDING A GUN!
- JUST STOP IT!
- TELL ME HOW TO DISARM--
- STOP IT!
- AH!
thud!
- [yelling]
- SCUMBAG,
I'M GONNA KILL YOU MYSELF!
- DAD!
WHAT ARE YOU--
- DILLON.
DILLON, DILLON.
HEY, SWEETHEART.
SWEETHEART, ARE YOU OKAY?
HEY.
HEY, HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HIM?
- SHH, SHH, SHH.
YOU GOTTA GO BACK
AND SEE MOM, OKAY?
NO, NO, NO, NO,
LOOK AT ME, BABY.
LISTEN, GO BACK TO MOM, OKAY?
GO NOW.
GO.
- 6 1/2 MINUTES!
- WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- PULL HIS BAD ARM
OUT TO THE SIDE.
- NO.
- PULL HIS BAD ARM
OUT TO THE SIDE!
- PLEASE DON'T!
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.
- UH! UH!
NO, PLEASE!
NO!
- IT'S JUST PAIN.
IT'LL BE OVER
AS SOON AS YOU TELL US.
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
PLEASE, NO.
[screaming]
- NO.
JUST STOP.
- [yelling]
- PLEASE, JUST STOP!
- STOP!
- DO YOU WANT TO GUESS
HOW TO DISARM IT?
- IF I TELL YOU,
IT'LL ONLY BE BECAUSE
I WANT YOU TO STOP,
BECAUSE I MADE IT UP.
I'M NOT THE BOMBER.
I'M NOT THE BOMBER.
I'M NOT THE BOMBER.
[screaming]
STOP! STOP!
STOP!
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH.
- I'M NOT THE BOMBER.
- ENOUGH!
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.
EVEN IF HE SPOKE THE TRUTH,
HOW WOULD WE KNOW WHAT IT IS?
HOW WOULD WE KNOW WHAT IT IS
AFTER THIS?
WE WOULDN'T.
NOW, WE HAVE TO RELY
ON THE INFORMATION HE GAVE US
WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS SAFE.
HUH?
- SO PULL BOTH WIRES
AT THE SAME TIME?
- YES!
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT YOU WANT TO LIVE.
YOU WANT TO LIVE, DON'T YOU?
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT BOMB
OUTSIDE.
I'M GOING TO PULL THOSE WIRES
UNLESS YOU TELL ME NOT TO
RIGHT NOW.
- FINE.
DO IT.
DO ANYTHING.
JUST DO IT.
- THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
- NO, NO, NO!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
JUST WAIT.
WHAT IF HE WASN'T THE BOMBER?
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
- BECAUSE I JUST REMEMBERED
SOMETHING.
IF THAT'S HIS BAG,
THEN THE OTHER ONE
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIS.
- WHY NOT?
- HE WASN'T CARRYING TWO BAGS.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WHAT, YOU HAVE
A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY?
- NO.
- WHAT WAS I CARRYING?
I WAS RIGHT ACROSS FROM YOU.
- HE WASN'T...CARRYING...
TWO BAGS, OKAY?
I WOULD HAVE NOTICED.
- I'M GOING TO TAKE IT
TO THE TUNNEL AND DISARM IT
IN CASE WE'RE WRONG.
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
MY WIFE IS STILL IN THAT TUNNEL.
- IT'S THE BEST CHANCE
FOR THE MOST PEOPLE.
YOU GOT FOUR MINUTES.
- SOMEBODY ELSE SHOULD DO IT.
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME?
- NO, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOU,
BUT YOU ARE THE PERSON
WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE NECESSARY
IF THIS BOMB BLOWS UP.
IT'S GOT TO BE
ONE OF THE REST OF US.
WE DECIDE RIGHT NOW.
RIGHT NOW!
WHICH ONE?
- I--I'M THE SMALLEST,
AND I CAN GET--
- NO!
I AM GONNA DO IT.
CONVERSATION OVER.
- NO.
I'M DOING IT.
I'M THE OLDEST,
I'VE LIVED A LIFE,
AND MY WIFE IS DEAD.
I'M DOING IT.
CONVERSATION OVER.
ALL RIGHT.
- I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE TUNNEL.
- I'LL BE BACK IN FOUR MINUTES.
- OH, STOP!
NO, STOP!
NO MORE.
- NOW, WE HAVE TO.
- I SAID NO MORE.
I CAN'T.
- HEY! HEY!
STOP!
- DAD!
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.
- [speaking Spanish]
- OKAY.
OH, GOD.
- WE DID IT.
- TELL YOLANDA THAT SHE'S--
SHE'S NEEDED IN THE BACK.
- [speaking Spanish]
- SHE NEEDS TO HURRY.
- <i>EMERGENCIA.</i>
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WE FOUND A BOMB.
IT'S OKAY;
WE KNOW HOW TO DISARM IT.
BUT NOW THEY WANT TO TAKE IT...
TO WHERE IT MIGHT CAUSE
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DAMAGE.
- GO WITH YOUR DAD.
- NO, I'M STAYING.
- GO WITH YOUR FATHER.
- IT'S NOT SAFE HERE, BABY.
COME ON.
- BUT WHAT ABOUT MOM?
- HEY, YOU KIDDING ME?
DID YOU SEE WHAT YOUR MOM
WENT THROUGH TODAY?
HUH?
YOUR MOM CAN SURVIVE ANYTHING.
- DO EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID.
- I KNOW.
A LIGHT?
THANK YOU.
- [speaking Spanish]
- NO, YOU NEED--LOOK, YOU NEED
TO GO TO THE BACK.
THERE'S ANOTHER BOMB.
- BOMB?
- YES, COME ON. COME ON.
- GET HER TO THE BACK.
- OKAY, COME ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, OKAY?
- NO, STAY THERE, OKAY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M GETTING THE KEY.
- FORGET ABOUT THE KEY.
JUST STAY THERE, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL--I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.
I'LL BE FINE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M GONNA HELP YOU GET OUT.
- LISTEN.
I NEED YOU TO GO BACK THERE,
OKAY?
THERE ARE ONLY
A COUPLE MINUTES LEFT.
I'LL BE FINE, ALL RIGHT?
- WE'RE WASTING TIME ARGUING.
JUST HELP ME.
ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
COME ON.
SO YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
I'M A MASS MURDERER?
- 90% SURE.
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- TORI.
- DON'T FORGET TO GIVE ME
YOUR NUMBER AFTER THIS.
- WHAT?
- I CLEAN UP NICE.
- [laughs]
- HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?
- 55. 54.
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S AS FAR IN
AS I'M GONNA GET IT.
- NO, SEE IF YOU CAN
PUSH IT FARTHER.
- IT'S AS FAR IN
AS I'M GONNA GET IT!
LEAVE THE FLASHLIGHT.
GO BACK.
LEAVE THE FLASHLIGHT!
GO BACK.
IF THIS BOMB GOES OFF,
YOU'RE GONNA BE NEEDED IN THERE.
GO!
- COME ON, BABY.
LET'S GO.
- GO.
- STAY HERE.
- I LOVE YOU.
- PLEASE TELL ME TO STAY.
- YOU GOTTA GO.
I LOVE YOU.
GO.
- COME, COME.
COME ON.

[metal clatters]
- JUST GO.
GO, GO, GO, GO.
- TORI, COME ON!
- [screams]
- [grunting]
- I LOVE YOU.
AND YOUR MOMMY LOVES YOU.
beep!
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT SHOULD HAVE GONE OFF.
- YOU DID WHAT HE SAID?
- I PULLED BOTH WIRES,
JUST LIKE HE SAID.
- GO, GO.
- [speaking Spanish]
- <i>GRACIAS.</i>
- SHE'D BE REALLY PROUD OF YOU.
- KATHY.
HER NAME WAS KATHY.
- MOM.
- HI, BABY.
HEY.
- HEY.
HOW YOU DOING?
- I COULD USE A VACATION.
- SERIOUSLY.
- BETTER.
MUCH BETTER.
- SEE?
- CAN'T EVEN FEEL ANYTHING
ANYMORE.
- WELL, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING
IN THE BAGS?
- JUST A FEW WATER BOTTLES
AND SNACKS.
NOTHING MUCH.
- AND--
WELL...
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAMES.
- I'M TORI.
- RUBINA.
- I'M SAM.
- AL.
OH, RIGHT.
YOU CHARMED THAT OUT OF ME.
- I'M MASON.
SO LISTEN.
THAT BOMB
STILL MAKES ME NERVOUS.
I'M GOING TO SEE
IF I CAN SET IT DEEPER
AND THEN BARRICADE THE TUNNEL.
- I COULD GET IT IN
THE FURTHEST.
I AM THE SMALLEST.
- NO, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
IT'S AS DEEP AS IT'S GONNA GET.
I--I BURIED IT IN THERE.
- OKAY, I STILL NEED
TO BARRICADE THE TUNNEL, THOUGH.
- NO.
- WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
WE KNOW WHO THE BOMBER IS,
DON'T WE?
- I JUST DON'T THINK
ANYONE SHOULD BE LEFT ALONE
WITH THE BOMB, OKAY?
- FINE.
YOU COME WITH ME.
IT'S A TWO-MAN JOB ANYWAYS.
HE WAS GOOD LUCK LAST TIME,
RIGHT?
COME ON.
LET'S GET TO WORK.
- ALL RIGHT.
- [sighs]
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS, OKAY?
SO I'M GOING TO TRY
AND FIND SOMETHING
ON THE BODIES TO PROVE IT.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, STOP.
STOP.
IT'S NO USE.
HE'S PROBABLY LONG GONE.
- OR HE'S ONE OF THE PEOPLE
THAT DIED
AND WE SHOULD FIND OUT.
- IT'S ME.
I'M THE BOMBER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- IT'S WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
THINKS,
AND IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING
FOR ALL OF US.
- SO WE SHOULD
JUST LET HIM GET AWAY.
- IF HE'S ALIVE,
THE ONLY THING KEEPING US SAFE
IS IF HE THINKS
HE GOT AWAY WITH IT.
SO LET ME TAKE THE RAP.
I'M FINE WITH BEING GUILTY
UNTIL RESCUE ARRIVES.
THE COPS WILL SORT IT OUT...
AS LONG AS WE'RE STILL HERE.
TORI?
JUST LET IT GO.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- UH, I JUST WANT TO SEE
IF I CAN PUSH IT IN
A LITTLE FURTHER.
- IT'S IN AS FAR
AS IT'S GOING TO GO, MASON.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, SAM?
YOU THINK I'M THE TERRORIST NOW?
- NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THE TERRORIST.
I THINK AL IS THE TERRORIST.
WE HAVE THE SUBWAY BOOKS.
HE KNEW HOW TO DISARM THE BOMB.
I JUST THINK
WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME!
- HE WOULD HAVE CHEWED OFF
HIS ARM TO GET COVER.
I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANY CLUE
IF IT WAS GOING TO GO OFF
OR NOT.
YOU DIDN'T DETACH THE WIRES.
- WHAT?
- UH, I CAN'T REACH IT.
SEE--SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
A POLE,
'CAUSE I WANT TO TRY
TO PUSH IT FURTHER IN.
- YEAH.
OKAY.
[glass crunching]
SAM?
SAM?
YOU GET THAT POLE?
SAM.
[rock clatters]
- BASTARD.
STILL LOOKING FOR CLUES?
- DON'T WORRY;
I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
- HE'S PROBABLY LONG GONE.
- SORRY.
- HEY.
WHY WERE YOU CRYING BEFORE?
- HUH!
WHICH TIME?
- WHEN YOU GOT ON THE TRAIN.
YOU WERE CRYING OVER SOME GUY,
RIGHT?
- YEAH.
- MY DAD.
- DAD?
WHAT IS HE?
DOCTOR?
LAWYER.
- PREACHER.
- SO YOU'RE REALLY SCREWED UP.
- YEAH.
YOU COULDN'T TELL?
NO, HE'S, UM...
HE REALLY IS A GREAT DAD.
[sighs]
THIS MORNING, I, UM--
I NEVER WANTED TO SEE HIM AGAIN.
NOW I'M TERRIFIED I NEVER WILL,
SO...
[loud bang]
IS EVERYONE OKAY?
- YEAH!
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.
I THINK IT CAME FROM OUTSIDE.
YOU STAY WITH MOMMY, OKAY?
- THESE GUYS ARE HURT!
ARE YOU OKAY?
HURRY!
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- OVER HERE. OVER HERE.
OVER HERE.
- HEY, SAM, SAM, SAM.
YOU OKAY?
COME ON, STAY WITH ME, BUDDY.
- MASON.
- LET'S GET UP.
- [groaning]
- I'M GOING TO GET YOLANDA.
- I'VE GOT HIM.
YOU GET MASON.
- OKAY, OKAY.
- COME ON.
- MASON.
[grunts]
- COME ON.
SIT OVER HERE.
- MASON.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
MASON.
- <i>ESTA MUERTO.</i>
- I HEARD A--A CRACK,
AND I LOOKED UP,
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
I WAS--
I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR,
AND HE PUSHED ME OUT OF THE WAY.
- DAD.
- HE SAVED MY LIFE.
HE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE FOR ME.
HE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE
FOR ME.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT HIS STORY GETS TOLD.
- MASON'S DEAD.
- RUBINA?
- CIRCUIT ON THIS SIDE
HAS A SHORT.
IT'S GOING TO DRAIN
THE BATTERIES.
IT'S DARKER,
BUT THE BOTTOM LIGHTS'LL LAST
TWICE AS LONG.
ADAM WAS AN ELECTRICIAN.
- I'M SORRY.
- WE WERE FIGHTING
WHEN IT HAPPENED.
HE GAVE ME THIS ENGAGEMENT RING,
AND I WANTED TO RETURN IT.
[light smashes]
THIS RING ISN'T OUR CUSTOM.
WE NEEDED MONEY.
ADAM SAID I NEEDED--
I NEEDED THE RING MORE.
NO, PLEASE.
PLEASE.
[crying]
- SHE'S REALLY LOSING IT.
- SHE JUST LOST HER FIANCE.
I'D BE MORE WORRIED
IF SHE WASN'T THIS UPSET.
LIKE SAM.
- WHAT?
- THERE'S SOMETHING OFF.
THE WAY THAT HE--
- EVERYBODY GRIEVES
IN THEIR OWN WAY, TORI.
OR MAYBE HE JUST DIDN'T LOVE HER
THAT MUCH.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE HIM A KILLER, SO--
- SHE'S NOT WEARING A RING.
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE BAG
WITH THE BOMB.
IT WAS UNDERNEATH HER.
- TORI, I'M TELLING YOU,
LET IT GO.
- NO, AL.
MASON WAS BEING ROUGH WITH IT.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
MASON WASN'T GOING FOR THE BOMB?
HE WAS THE ONE
WHO TOOK THE GUN.
- AL, WHO HAS THE GUN?
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
I COVERED KAREN.
- NO, THAT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL.
THANK YOU.
KATHY.
HER NAME WAS KATHY.
- OH, RIGHT.
KATHY.
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD CHECK ON HER.
[inaudible dialogue]
- WHERE YOU GOING?
- SHE'S REALLY UPSET.
WE'RE GOING OUTSIDE TO TALK.
- ALL RIGHT.
BE CAREFUL.
- THANKS.
- WHAT IS IT?
STOP THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP THAT.
- THE GUN'S NOT HERE ANYMORE.
I THINK SOMEONE TOOK IT.
RUBINA, LISTEN TO ME.
I THINK I KNOW WHO DID THIS.
AND I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.
PLEASE.
- WHAT WERE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?
- RUBINA.
- I'M SORRY THEY DID THIS
TO YOU.
- I CAN'T REALLY BLAME THEM.
- WHO DO YOU BLAME?
IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION,
ISN'T IT?
- HEY, UM,
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR--
IT'S KIND OF ABOUT YOUR WIFE.
UM...
YOU'RE KIND OF GOING THROUGH
A SIMILAR SITUATION AS RUBINA,
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
MORE OF IT SHE CAN TAKE.
- OH.
- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD--
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP HER OUT
OR TALK TO HER OR SOMETHING.
- I'LL, UH--
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.
- THANK YOU.
- HEY.
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.
I'M FINE, REALLY.
I JUST--I WAS NOTICING
HOW BEAUTIFUL
YOUR WIFE'S RING IS.
I, UM--IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S COMING OFF.
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IT.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.
- DILLON, HONEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- MOM NEEDED WATER.
- OKAY.
UM, HERE.
- WHY'D YOU GIVE HIM YOUR RING?
- THAT'S--
- NO.
- NO!
- [gasps]
OKAY, DILLON.
- ALL RIGHT, GIRL!
GET OVER THERE!
GET OVER THERE!
GO.
GO!
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
- BABY, WE NEED THE WATER
BACK HERE FOR MOM--
- DADDY?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SAM, WHY DO YOU HAVE A GUN?
DON'T--
- DO NOT MOVE,
OR I WILL KILL HER.
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.
I'M TAKING HER OUTSIDE.
WE'RE GOING TO WAIT
UNTIL WE'RE RESCUED,
AND THEN
I'M GOING TO LET HER GO,
AND SHE'S GONNA BE FINE,
ALL RIGHT?
DO NOT MOVE.
DO NOT TALK.
LET'S GO.
- SAM.
PLEASE.
PLEASE JUST TAKE ME INSTEAD.
PLEASE.
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
I CAN'T DO THAT,
BECAUSE YOU WOULD SACRIFICE HER.
NOW, LET'S GO VERY SLOWLY.
- PLEASE.
IT'S OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, GO THROUGH THERE
VERY, VERY SLOWLY.
- NO, JARED.
JARED. JARED.
- THAT'S MY BABY.
OH, GOD.
- SHE'LL BE OKAY.
- OH, MY GOD,
I JUST LET HIM TAKE HER.
OH, GOD!
OH, MY GOD.
[sobbing]
OH, MY GOD.
OH. OH.
WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL
KRISTINE?
- IT'S OKAY.
DILLON?
IS YOUR NAME DILLON?
ALL RIGHT, DILLON.
I KNOW THIS IS REALLY SCARY.
BUT I'M SCARED TOO.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE YOUR DAD
IS SO MAD AT ME.
DID YOU SEE WHAT HE DID
TO THAT MAN IN THERE?
I KNOW YOU SAW THAT.
HE HURT THAT MAN
REALLY BADLY.
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
TO DO THAT TO ME.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
I HAVE AN IDEA.
INSIDE THAT CAVE,
THERE'S A DOCTOR'S KIT,
AND IT'S FULL OF GOOD MEDICINE
THAT'LL FIX YOUR MOM UP.
NOW, IF I WENT AND GOT THAT,
I COULD BRING IT IN,
FIX YOUR MOM UP,
AND YOUR DAD WOULD LIKE ME.
BUT THAT CAVE IS TOO SMALL.
I CAN'T FIT.
YOU COULD FIT.
- I CAN'T DO IT.
- YES, YOU CAN, BECAUSE
THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN.
YOUR DAD WOULDN'T BE MAD,
WOULD HE?
IF I FIXED YOUR MOM?
RIGHT?
YEAH, OKAY.
SO YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT;
YOU'RE GONNA GO IN THERE
AND GET THAT DOCTOR'S KIT
WITH ALL THAT GOOD MEDICINE.
AND YOU BRING IT OUT HERE.
GO ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
I'M GONNA GO GET A LIGHT
SO YOU CAN SEE,
AND YOU BRING
THAT DOCTOR'S KIT OUT.
GO ON, DILLON.
GO ON. GET IN THERE.
OKAY, I'M GETTING A LIGHT.
- [speaking Spanish]
<i>DONDE ESTA DILLON?</i>
<i>DONDE ESTA DILLON?</i>
- SAM.
SAM TOOK DILLON.
- WE HAVE TO GET HER BACK.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW.
- AL, WE HAVE TO DO
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAYS.
- OH, NOW YOU WANT TO DO
NOTHING?
YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING
THIS ENTIRE TIME.
- AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED!
AL WAS RIGHT, AND WE
SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO HIM.
THIS IS ALL OF MY FAULT.
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THIS IS YOUR FAULT?
- I THOUGHT IT WAS SAM.
WE FIGURED OUT THAT HE WAS LYING
ABOUT HIS WIFE,
AND WE TRAPPED HIM,
AND, JARED, I AM SO SORRY.
- LOOK, THAT LIE WOULD HAVE
COME OUT SOONER OR LATER,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU GUYS DID.
AT LEAST WE HAVE A CHANCE
TO FIGHT BACK NOW.
- NO, WE ARE NOT GONNA
FIGHT BACK!
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO MY LITTLE GIRL...
- HEY!
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY A SAINT
YOURSELF.
NOW, I DON'T TRUST A SINGLE WORD
THAT COMES
OUT OF THAT MAN'S MOUTH,
AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE HIM
ANY MORE TIME TO PLOT--
- TIME TO DO WHAT?
HE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.
HE HAD A CHANCE TO KILL
ALL OF US, AND HE DIDN'T.
- YEAH?
WELL, HE KILLED MY FIANCE.
AND I WILL BE DAMNED
IF I STAND AROUND HERE
AND DO NOTHING.
- COME ON, DILLON.
GOOD GIRL.
ALL THE WAY.
COME ON, DILLON.
DILLON, THERE IS MEDICINE
IN THAT CASE
THAT YOUR MOMMY NEEDS.
NOW, HURRY UP.
GOOD GIRL.
GO ON.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT?
NOW, BRING IT BACK.

DON'T OPEN THE--
DILLON?
BAD GIRL. LIGHTS OUT.
NOW, DILLON, IT'S PRETTY SCARY
IN THERE, ISN'T IT? HUH?
I'M TURNING THE LIGHTS BACK ON
BUT ONLY IF YOU BRING
THAT CASE OUT.
AND IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'RE DYING IN THERE, DILLON,
AND I'M GOING TO GO BACK
INTO THAT SUBWAY CAR
AND I'M GOING TO START
SHOOTING PEOPLE,
STARTING WITH YOUR MOMMY
AND THEN YOUR DAD.
ALL RIGHT, DILLON?
LIGHTS ON.
GOOD GIRL.
COME ON.

[gravel clattering]

WE DIDN'T COPY.
DO YOU WANT THAT?
THEN YOU STAY ON THIS TRAIN
AND YOU DO NOT DO A DAMN THING!
ALL RIGHT?
COME ON.
- HE SMASHED IT.
HE SMASHED THE RADIO.
WHY WOULD HE SMASH IT?
DOESN'T HE WANT TO BE RESCUED?
- I TOLD YOU.
DON'T TRUST HIM.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT RESCUE.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY--WHY DIDN'T HE
JUST SHOOT US?
- THE BULLETS.
HE DOESN'T WANT THE BULLETS
IN THE BODY.
HE THINKS HE CAN STILL
GET AWAY WITH THIS.
- HOW'S HE GONNA DO THAT?
- HE HAS BOMB.
- WHAT?
- THE BOMB.
IF HE REARMS THE BOMB,
HE CAN MAKE US LOOK LIKE
WE ALL DIED IN THE CRASH.
- NO, HOW DOES HE DO THAT
WITHOUT BLOWING HIMSELF UP?
- I DON'T KNOW,
AND I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT.
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
- YOU HAVE A DOG, DILLON?
WHAT'S ITS NAME?
- DAISY.
- DAISY.
ALL RIGHT.
DAISY MISBEHAVES SOMETIMES,
DOESN'T SHE?
MAYBE SHE RUNS
ACROSS THE STREET.
AND SHE COULD GET HIT BY A CAR,
AND SHE COULD DIE, RIGHT?
SO YOU HAVE TO PUNISH DAISY.
YOU HAVE TO SMACK HER.
"BAD GIRL!"
RIGHT?
'CAUSE SHE'S AN ANIMAL,
AND SHE OPERATES ON INSTINCT.
WE'RE ANIMALS TOO--
YOU AND I,
ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
AND OUR INSTINCTS,
THEY'RE NOT GOOD.
OUR INSTINCT
IS FOR SELF-PRESERVATION.
THAT MEANS WE CARE
ABOUT OURSELVES
MORE THAN WE CARE
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS
TO SUFFER OURSELVES.
THEN WE CAN STOP
AND WE CAN ASK,
"WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
WHAT DO I LEARN FROM IT?"
WE ARE PERFECTLY WILLING
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE DIE
AS LONG AS WE HAVE
COMFORTABLE LIVES.
NOW, WE HAVE TO DO BETTER
THAN THAT.
WE HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT,
OR WE WON'T HAVE A WORLD
ANYMORE.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, DILLON.
YOU SEEM LIKE A VERY NICE GIRL.
SHINE THE LIGHT.
- HI.
- DILLON?
- SHE'S NOT FAR.
KRIS, RESCUE'S COMING.
YOU GOTTA STAY WITH ME.
DILLON NEEDS YOU, HONEY.
- YEAH.
- OKAY.
LET'S GET IN POSITION.
WE GOTTA DRAW THIS GUY
BACK HERE, MAKE SOME NOISE.
- MAYBE I COULD CLIMB UP ON TOP.
- OKAY.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
