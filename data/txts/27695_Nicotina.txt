Yeah. Go deep. Direct account access.
Can you do it or not?
Yeah, yeah, l can.
But they scramble the codes

-No problem.
How much, Nene?
Diamonds, Lolo. Lots.
-l'll get on it right now.
-Good.

-He'll get on it now.
"Now" or "right now?"

Fine. When?
-l'll let you know.
-Fine.
Nene...

-He died, he died.
-He died 'cause his number was up.
-He died from smoking like a chimney.
-Nobody dies from just smoking.
-More smokers die than non-smokers.
-Where'd you get that from?
Statistics, kid.
Statistics,
check him out, statistics...
Lots of people die from lung cancer
and never touch a cigarette...
Wanna know why?
'Cause assholes like you blew smoke
in their faces!
No, there are a lot of variables...
and when they all coincide,
you die.

Eulogia?
Eulogia, it's me, Andrea.
Coming!
Hi. What a surprise!
Can l help you?
Did Eulogia leave?
Yeah... l think so.
l think l heard her go. Why?
She was going to leave my key in
the plant pot. Have you got a copy?
No, no, of course not.
-lf the tenants don't offer me one...
-Of course...
Lolo, do me a favour?
Could l use your phone?
My phone?
So l can call Joaquin, from upstairs.
Eulogia was supposed to leave my key
so he could move that plant in.
Just a sec.
l'll page him cause his wife's
on the jealous side...
Hey, wait a minute...
lsn't this your key?
Yes. Yes. that's it.
She must have got the wrong pot...
But if Joaquin brought this one...
-Don't worry about it.
-But it's impossible.
lt could happen to anyone.
Thanks, Lolo. l've been a bit
on edge these days...
My phone?
See you in a while.
TELEPHONE: ANDREA.
RECORDlNG...
-Hello?
-Andrea? lt's Claudia. What's up?
-No news. Nothing.
-Call him.
Let him answer my emails,
l'm not going begging.
Maybe he heard something.
Fifty year-olds freak when they feel
threatened by a younger man.
Be kind and give him a call.
He's 44, Claudia.
And has been conducting long enough
to know what goes on in an orchestra.
He knows several are willing
to do you a favour.
Yeah, young...
and stupid. Sleep with them once
and they think they own you.
You can't even rehearse in peace.
Girl, you're not getting
any younger yourself.
Carlos is offering you
First Cello in Seville.
-lt's way to get back to Spain.
-Sure, but Spain's no prize for me.
First, he's got to work things out
with his ex. l won't be his lover.
l've got Joaquin for that, and
he's 100 percent married.
-Who, the gardener from upstairs?
-Claudia, l gotta hang up...
something's wrong with the computer.
l'll call support.
-l'll call you later.
-Fine.
Hello?
You're an angel! Sorry to bother
you, but l just don't get it.
lt's not your fault.
These cloned computers...
sometimes you just get
a bad processor...
and if the processor is bad,
then the chips start to go...
-Heard anything from Carlos?
-Emails get lost, don't they?
Not if they were sent.
Fucking Carlos.
You're too good for that second rate
orchestra in Seville.
The London Philharmonic at least.
Take lessons from Yo-Yo Ma...
Find me a man who's got the dough
and l'm there.
He could be a toad or a geek.
Music makes up for everything.
So, what are you up to?
Well, actually, l'm closing
what you might call....
a very lucrative business deal.
Many thousands of dollars...
That's great!
Well, if you could
check out my computer...
Carlos might have written by now.
l'm gonna take a shower.
l don't know what l'd do
without you.
Lolo! Can you get the door?
Yes...
Yes...sorry,
coming, coming...
-This is Andrea's apartment, right?
-Yes.
l'm Lolo.
l'm her neighbour.
-We met once before.
-lf you don't mind...
Lolo? Who is it?
What the... Carlos!
Okay, look, say you've got a cell.
A human cell.
Right?
Now, for whatever reason that cell's
on the verge of going berserk.
One fine fucking day when
your defences are down...
that cell's gonna blow.
Smoke, don't smoke, whatever...
You're gone.
-That's the hotel...
-What?
That's where we're going later.
See what l mean?
See what l'm saying?
Life...
is full of fucking coincidences.
l'm out of cigarettes...
and that's the Russians' hotel.
-What?
-Now that's a fucking coincidence!
ln that hotel l had
the sweetest piece of ass ever.
They were playing this song.
And the song, the girl and me...
we all came together.
Now, that's a fucking coincidence!
Yeah, sure.
Deaf as a post...
You have good taste.
A pack of "Tropicales".
Just a moment.
Helps keep me from temptation.
Smoking's not allowed in here.
-Want one?
-Okay.
Didn't you say it wasn't allowed?
Customers can.
Where are you from?
Villa Ortuzar...
Buenos Aires.
-What are you doing here?
-Data Transmission...
Door to door.
-Thanks.
-Hey...
That's one of the few things
in life worth living for.
Get away!
See if this helps you understand,
my dear Thompson.
This, is one of the few things
in life worth living for.
Alright.
But blow your spare smoke
at someone else.
l'm dying for it...
Me too.

Oh, fuck no...

Thousands.
Nene...

Alright Lolo, let's go.
Nene, l can't go. l've got problems

-Just bring back my share.
-Lolo, please get in the car.
l've got a serious problem.
And l forgot my glasses.
Lolo, this deal pans out,
no neighbour will resist you.
Whatever then.
But make it quick.
Got a smoke?
Later. lt bothers Thompson
if you smoke in the car.
Okay.
Hey, Thompson.
Stupid cow!
Clara!
Clara!
What's the matter?
This is full of mistakes.
One, two, three boxes without prices.
And who knows how many more...
lt's a few little boxes.
Why can't you just admit
you screwed up?
The problem is that for you
l screw up everything...
so l end up screwing it up.
-So now it's my fault?
-No, it's not like that. lt's just...
You put the labels on wrong
and l end up being the asshole.
All right, we're done.
Clara, the problem is
l'm dying for a smoke...
and it's makes me nervous.
C'mon...
Don't say l offended you?
You know what?
l'm gonna take a fast shower...
and we'll forget all about accounts
and labels...
which in the end
nobody gives a fuck about.
Then, we'll have a quickie
before some customer comes in.
No, Beto, not today.
Come on, it'll do us good.
Look, look how tense you are...
What is it? Headache?
No, it's not that.
l haven't felt well all day...
Didn't show.
Doesn't show now, either.
Seriously, Beto.
l don't feel well.
Does it repulse you
when l touch you?
When l kiss you?
Answer me, goddamn it!
All of a sudden
you're so sick...
but l heard you giggling with that
asshole from the lab this morning.
-We were discussing discounts.
-l bet.
You nearly died laughing.
And l give you a headache?
Look what you made me do!
Goddamn it!
What are you doing?
Don't you know what l'm going
through trying to quit that shit?
Don't even think about going outside.
There are fucking maniacs everywhere.
<i>I miss you...</i>

<i>You can't imagine, Iove...</i>

<i>I miss you...</i>

<i>In every moment...</i>
Clara!
<i>I miss you.</i>
For example, you break your neck
in the bathtub...
get bitten by a rabid dog,
struck by lightning...
get shoved under the metro.
A bus comes...
as you step off the curb
without looking...
suffocated, electrocuted...
-There are nineteenth million ways...
-Nine-teen...
Say it. Nine-teen.
Say it.
-Nine-teen.
-There...
Be the wiseguy now, Nene...
but keep sucking down smoke like that
and you'll never reach my age.
Whatever. l'd rather have a short,
good life than a long, boring one.
-Doesn't prove the contrary...
-The contrary of what?
Of what you're saying.
And what am l saying?
The same as l am, for God's sake.
We're saying the same fucking thing.
No. No, sir.
No we're not.
l said short.
Good evening.
The rocks, please.
lt all depends what you call short
and what you call long.
-What's he say?
-You've given us shit!
Fuck, that could be
my neighbour.
-What did he say?
-There is not a fucking thing on it.
Right.
Do you think we're stupid?
He might be right.
lt might not have anything on it.
Give me the disc.
He's copying it, the fucking Russian!
He's copying it!
You okay, Nene?
-You got hit, kid, you got hit.
-Get him!
Over there!
Nene!
Thompson!
Wait!
lt was my mistake, dude...
lt was that girl...!
We can fix it, man!
<i>Baby, gimme kisses</i>

Goyo, did you take money
from that Russian?
Yes, to pay the mortgage.
Fucking Russian...
he must be round here
somewhere.
Nene...
Let's go to the chemist's
so they can plug that hole.
No... l'll manage.
Don't be an idiot...
We'll look for the Russian later.
All set, Don Alberto.
Don Alberto!
You're all set,
just let me brush you down.
No, no, don't look for it.
lt's on the house.
l'll see you out.
Take it easy, now.
Come back whenever you want.
God bless you, Don Alberto.
Goyo!
He gets a free haircut and
l can't afford cigarettes?
Like what that old man could pay
would make a difference.
lt's that stupid way of thinking
that got us where we are.
Do you know how much you spend
on cigarettes, Carmen?
See? When God closes a window
a door opens.
Still open?
Yes.
Sorry to be cautious, but we can't
be too careful these days.
-Can l help you?
-l want to shave beard and head.
-Didn't you like the way l cut it?
-Yes liked. But changed mind.
Keep your mouth shut,
you look prettier!
lnside, come on.
Don't hurt me, please.
Take everything,
but please, don't hurt me.
Quiet...
-lt's all in the top drawer...
-This isn't a fucking hold-up!
Look after Nene's wound.
l can't. l've never dressed
a wound like that before.
Where does that door go to?
To an inner yard.
Are you alone?
Yes.
Quick. Get the fucking Russian...
l'll pull through.
-You gonna be okay?
-That depends...
-On what?
-On where the bullet went in.
You damn well better be okay.
And you...
Give him your strongest painkillers,
clean and bandage the wound.
lf anything happens to him,
l'll kill you. Got it?
l'll be right back,
you stubborn fool.
Give me a cigarette.
lt's not a good idea,
if you're wounded...
Give me a cigarette!
Please.
What the fuck?
Are you allergic?
To chocolate...
but l'm not sure.
Not sure?
A lot of different variables
have to coincide:
the type of cocoa,
whether it's got milk...
Where's the key to this door?
-lsn't it in the lock?
-No.
lt's got to be around,
or in the counter drawer.
l never use that door.
Go in there...
Shaved bald?
Yes. Head and beard.
That's two items. Eighty for the head
and eighty for the beard.
-A hundred sixty total.
-Yes, whatever.
Shall l take yourjacket
and your briefcase?
No.
lt's just fine here.
-Paquita?
-Yeah...
Svoboda. Things got fucked up.
Bad fucked up.
-What happened?
-l'm hit, but got away.
-You've got the rocks?
-Yes. Not deliver...
-You're sure?
-Yes. Got them...
-All?
-Yeah, yeah, all twenty.
-ln the belly.
-ln the belly?
ln the belly.
Don't know how got in...
-Sure you're okay?
-Cancel flight, get surgeon.
-l take taxi.
-No, wait, no...
You hear me?
l get shot.
You cut me no razor, no scissors.
Just shaver.
-You've got a bullet in there?
-Stayed in.
Problem being fat.
Oh, shit!
Rib is broke.
Do you want a drink of water?
No, l'm fine.
-How's this?
-Perfect. Sit down!
Carmen...
l'll do my best...
but...
you're aiming that at me...
and l can't do it like that.
Not without cooperation.
Goyo...
he died...
He's dead.
Why did you hang up on me,
asshole?
Those diamonds are my life!
Where are you?
We'll get you...
Svoboda? Are you okay?
Don't fucking hang up...
What are you looking for?
Diamonds!
l just heard he has diamonds.
Twenty.
ln the belly...
What the fuck
are you talking about?
He said he had them
in his belly.
Of course...
he swallowed them.
He must be
in the Russian Mafia.
Look, it was on TV.
Carriers swallow capsules with
diamonds, cocaine, whatever...
and then they take a laxative.
This Russian...
Has 20 diamonds in his belly.
That's a fortune, Goyo.

Wait.
He always goes straight to bed
after he's showered.
-Give me the fucking key!
-Listen.
We've been robbed
five times this year...
he quit smoking and is going crazy.
lf he sees a gun...
Fuck him.

-And?
And?
What do you mean, "and"?
Whatever you're thinking,
Carmen...
don't count on me.
l haven't counted on you
for a long time...
-Me neither...
-That's not true.
lf my brother hadn't helped us out,
we wouldn't even have this dump!
-l never told you to ask him!
-You're no good even for that.
-And your brother is?
-Of course he is!
He's worked like a dog

Ripping off Social Security!
Selling them recycled junk!
That's not true!

They never proved a thing!
Goyo, look...
lf we call the police...
those diamonds will disappear.
We're the only ones
who saw this guy come in.
But he's dead.
Can you imagine digging diamonds
out of a dead man's guts?

is twenty-four feet long...
But twenty diamonds
is a lot of rocks.
We can feel for them

You're out of your mind!
We've made so many sacrifices.
lf anybody deserves a prize
like this it's us.
We could go to Acapulco,
Cancun...
the Bahamas,
buy a 36 inch TV set...
-and a DVD like Toño's got...
-See?
You'd spend it on crap
and next year we'll be broke again.
Besides...
we'll have to wait for a few months
before selling them...
But Toño has contacts...
Toño, Toño!
You think l don't have balls or
ambition? ls that what you think?
No, Goyo. Let's not fight.
lt's just that stolen diamonds
are not easy to sell and Toño...
Enough of Toño!
Toño could, Toño can!
Here, call that hot shit
brother of yours. Go on.
Let Toño come
and fix it all...
because he solves everything.
Carmen, if anything goes wrong...
l wasn't here and l saw nothing.
Hey, is it that bad?
Sorry, bad joke.
No formal complaint and l can't

We had an appointment, remember?
l'm on my way out.
Later...
lt doesn't matter. l can wait until

Well, she hasn't finished...

-First thing...
-l can't.

-No, let me go, please.
-Don't make me beg.
-Let me go, Beto!
-What the fuck's wrong with you?
Fuck!
You bit me!
You fucking bitch!

Gee, Don Goyo, really,

Yes, yes.
-Do you smoke, Doña Carmen?
-Oh, yes, thank you...
l'll keep it for when
l'm finished... Yes.
Light it. Light it up.
Oh, l'm sorry, the towel
got caught on your beard...
Did l pull too hard?
lf the Chief were to catch me
with sideburns like his...
Fuck!
Must be a relief not to shave
every day though, right?
But isn't it itchy
when it's hot?
He's asleep.
How l envy him!
l wish l could just drop off
any place...
With my shifts,
l hardly catch three hours in a row.
Got that ashtray?
Carmen.
Yes.
Thanks.
Hey, is that blood?
No, no. lt's the red grease l use
on the chairs so they'll roll easily.
Red grease?
As runny as that?
lt must have got mixed up with
some older grease...
Listen, that's blood,
look at that wound in his gut...
Put your hands on your head!
-What are you doing?
-Move!
Easy, easy...
l won't do anything.
l said, hands on your head!
Tie him up. Only an idiot
would have let him in!
He let himself in.
Didn't you?
-The door was open.
-Take his gun!
Don't aim at me,
it could go off...
Take his gun and tie him up,
l said!
-Where are you going?
-To get some rope!
First take away his gun!
Just calm down. Let me help...
Holy fuck! You killed him!
You blew it by letting him in.
Check.
He might not be dead.
Don't be a faggot...
Lay him down.
-l'm not touching him...
-Lay him down, l said!
-You aiming at me, Carmen?
-Don't tempt me!
There.
Now, stop pointing that at me.
Put him in there.
-No, not until we've talked...
-No, Goyo!
l'm not going out that door...
as poor as l was when
l came in this morning!
Not you nor anyone
will stop me!
Evening, Doña Clara...
-Good evening, Memo.
-Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Something you need?
ls Beto in?
He's asleep.
He went off to bed a while ago...
-Anything wrong?
-No, l got something for him.
Sure you're all right?
You look like you've been...?
Are you helping a customer?
Beto! lt's me, Memo!
How you doing, buddy?
Memo! How're you doing?
Clara, let me out,
l want to talk to Memo.
Oh, so you got the lion in a cage?
You surprise me, Doña Clara.
Mind if l come in?
No...
The thing is... actually,
Beto and l were...
-Oh, you were?
-No, nothing like that.
See, l made a mistake
on some price tags...
and you know how Beto is.
Well, come on,
he's at ground zero.
lmagine forty cigarettes a day
and suddenly, nothing!
Give him a few days
and he'll calm down.
Memo, don't go,
l wanna talk to you!
Clara, now,
please open the door.
Can l talk to him a sec?
Let him in and
come straight back here.
No, Thompson, l swear l didn't.
The CD was all ready...
lt was pure coincidence,
just bad luck...
-You too, punk?
-Me too, what?
Coincidence, my balls!
All right, but at least let's warn
the Russian, before...
Either shut up,
or l'll shut you up. Got it?
-All right.
-Okay. l'll shut up.
But let me call my neighbour
and tell her what happened.
Please don't ask him in.
My eyes are all swollen...
Beto...
-How's it going, Memo?
-What's up?
-Hey, don't be mad...
-No problem...
l brought you some packs...
l'll bring the rest tomorrow.
Got what l gave you nearby?
Cool, just there's been a shooting,
there's a couple bastards around.
Just keep cool.
Go do what you've got to.
-Catch you later.
-See you.
What the fuck is going on
inside your head?
Go to bed and we'll talk about it
tomorrow, Beto.
l'll go to bed
when l fucking want to!
What's this?
What have you been doing?
What did l ask you?
Enough, Beto, okay?
You made me look an asshole
so you could smoke?
lt wasn't me, Beto.
What are you talking about?
Go on, get out of here!
Nene?
Nene? The heat is gone.
Poke him in the guts.
Cut where you feel the stones.
l can't feel a thing...
Cut him. Start with the stomach.
l can't...
l can't, l can't do it.
Get your brother to bring the
ultrasound he used for his cons...
l wish you were half
as bright as him!
Oh yes, his ideas are all brilliant!
l admit it.
l've never been
any good at business...
but l've broken my back
to set up this barber's shop.
What have you done?
You just take courses:
computers, tourism, sushi!
-Enough, Goyo!
-lt's not fucking enough!
Go on, shoot me!
Maybe then you'll stop
giving me shit!
Thompson!
Thompson!
Thompson!

You tried to kill me!
Get out of here.

lf you want to help...

in rubbish bags.
Poor old Sanchez...
He even said thank you.
-Where's the Russian?
-What's up?
What the fuck are you doing?
Don't kill us...
we didn't do anything to your friend,
he just died.
The rocks.
-Where are the rocks?
-They aren't there...
l can't find them.
They aren't in his briefcase.
He said he had them in his belly...
But l've searched his guts
and l couldn't find a fucking stone.
You got the wrong belly,
you fucking lunatic.
Take this!
Get it from him!
Hurry!
Nene, hang on.
lt was an accident,
we'll fix it.
Nene...
Nene...
Nene, don't fuck with me, dude.
Oh, dude.
Oh, man.
Oh, dude.
Honestly, Officer, believe me...

He died all by himself.

gets here, he'll tell you...
There he is! Goyo!
Goyo!
Goyo!
Goyo...
