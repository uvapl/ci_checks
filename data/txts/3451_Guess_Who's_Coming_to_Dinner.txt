You know, I just had a thought.
I´II go check in a hoteI and get
some rest, and you go find your foIks.
Let´s go meet them. The sooner
it´s over with, the better.
Mom wiII be out to Iunch.
Dad´s at his office.
-You may not meet them tiII dinner.
-You may be wrong about them.
You shouId´ve toId them
we were coming.
It may be the biggest shock
of your young Iife.
After 23 years of Iiving with them,
don´t you think I know them?
I hope so.
There´s no probIem.
We´II be a minute, then we´d
Iike to go to CIaremont Drive.
I´II see if Mom´s in the office.
-Joey?
-HiIary! How are you?
What a surprise!
-I´II be with you in a moment.
-Okay.
-Strange.
-One of HiIary´s favourites.
-It´s caIIed a kinetic scuIpture.
-A what?
Look.
Isn´t that someth--?
-What are you doing here?
-I thought Mother might be here.
-I´d Iike you to meet Dr. Prentice.
-I´m so pIeased to meet you.
PIeasure to see you.
Christina´s Iunching with Mr. CazeIet.
I can ring up.
No, just teII her I´m back.
Has something happened?
Is anything wrong?
Something´s happened,
but everything´s right.
-How was Hawaii? Was it fun?
-Hawaii was unbeIievabIe.
Do you Iive in San Francisco, doctor,
or are you visiting?
Just passing through.
It was a pIeasure to have met you.
HiIary runs the gaIIery,
but it´s Mom who has aII the ideas.
Your idea to put originaIs
in hoteI rooms is briIIiant.
Gives peopIe time
to decide if they Iike them.
The hoteI gets free decor, the guests
can Iook at good paintings...
...the painter can make a saIe,
and Mom gets commission.
Take the next right!
-Isn´t that cIever?
-That is cIever.
-What do I owe you?
-$1 0.50, Mac.
TweIve bucks, right?
Right.
Right.
John, come meet TiIIie!
TiIIie, this is Dr. Prentice.
John, Miss MatiIda Binks.
PIeased to meet you, Miss Binks.
I´ve heard a great deaI about you!
What are you doing home unexpected?
You toId them you´re back?
I Ieft a message for Mom.
It´s IoveIy to see you!
Why are you home?
You want those bags upstairs?
-Not my two. I´ve not come to stay.
-I´II teII you aII about it.
You eat any Iunch yet?
CouId you make us sandwiches?
We´II have it on the terrace.
Do you Iike it?
-It´s beautifuI.
-Come out and Iook from the terrace.
-What?
-Who´s that?
Dorothy. Isn´t she a knockout?
She heIps TiIIie.
-Which days?
-Never mind.
-I ought to caII my foIks.
-Use the phone in the study.
-WiII you introduce me?
-Not on the phone.
-Won´t you teII them?
-I´d rather write.
I have to meet them
before I come to Geneva.
Or wiII we keep our marriage
a secret from them?
Why didn´t I think of that?
That´s a thought!
I´II shut this in case Dorothy
goes by.
Los AngeIes, pIease. Area code 21 3.
Axminister 246-99. Time and charges.
I´ve got a right to my own opinions,
and you want my opinion?
I don´t Iike one of my race
getting above himseIf.
If I ever want your opinion,
I´II ask for--
Oh, TiIIie, I´m sorry.
I didn´t mean that.
But you can´t mean what you´re saying,
and you´re so wrong.
You´re the Iast person I´d expect...
...to take such a siIIy attitude.
I´ve aIways Ioved you,
and you´re just as bIack as he is.
It´s right for me to Iove you
and wrong to Iove him?
Just stop and think about that.
-What´s for dinner tonight?
-CeIery soup and rump steak.
Come on! TurtIe soup and tournedos.
And one of your best pies?
It´s Mom!
Joey? DarIing?
-What the heII? Joey?
-Mom!
DarIing, are you aII right?
Everything´s fine!
I rang the gaIIery to teII HiIary
that CazeIet had agreed to--
He has? That´s marveIIous!
She thought you might have a surprise.
What did she mean?
Do I hear someone?
Is there someone here?
Mom! I´ve never been so happy
in aII my Iife! I´m just....
Bursting. I can see that.
I´m feeIing happy for you.
Do I know him?
I onIy met him myseIf 1 0 days ago.
You won´t beIieve
what´s happened in 1 0 days!
I might, if you´d pipe down
Iong enough to teII me.
-WonderfuI things have happened in--
-Mom, he´s so wonderfuI!
I´ve never known anyone Iike him.
I feII in Iove with him in 20 minutes!
WeII! That was quick.
Dad, I wanted to stop on the way back,
but time got so short...
...and I´ve got to get to work.
I don´t understand why
you couldn´t spend one day with us.
WeII, fact is, Dad, I met this girI.
You met a girl? Why didn´t you say so?
Mary, he´s met a girll
That´s good news.
Does she live in San Francisco?
Yes. I´m at her house now.
He´s at the girl´s house now.
Where did you meet her, Hawaii?
Yes. And I wanted to meet her foIks.
-That sounds good, I mean, serious.
-Yes. It´s serious.
-This is quite a surprise.
-She´s surprising in a Iot of ways.
-Your mother says, ´´Is she pretty?´´
-Yes, she´s pretty.
Your mother says, ´´How old is she?´´
What´s the difference?
-She´s onIy 23, Dad.
-23, that´s good.
You´re 3 7, that´s just right.
Women age faster than men.
-You reckon to marry the girl?
-We´ve been taIking about it, but....
Dad, there´s one or two probIems,
you see...
...that I´II write to you about
on the pIane to New York tonight.
AII right?
He´s so caIm and sure of everything.
He doesn´t have any tensions in him.
He knows what he beIieves
and what he thinks is right...
...and why, and where he´s going.
Mom, there´s one thing I must teII you.
He was married before,
and he had a son.
It was so tragic.
His wife and son were kiIIed
in a train accident eight years ago.
And John....
I haven´t even toId you his name!
It´s John Wade Prentice.
Isn´t that a IoveIy name?
John Wade....
Joanna Prentice, I´II be.
But, Mom. Mom?
There´s something eIse...
...that John´s been very deepIy
concerned about.
He´s been worrying if
you and Dad wouId be upset if--
It´s about time!
I was wondering where you´d been.
Mom, this is John.
Doc-- Doc-- Dr. Prentice?
I´m so pIeased to meet you.
I´m pIeased to meet you, Mrs. Drayton.
Joanna´s aIready
busted out with the news.
She has toId me a good deaI,
and aII very quickIy too.
She´s onIy known me for 1 0 days,
so she can´t teII when I´m bIushing.
That couId be another probIem for us.
I´m medicaIIy quaIified, so I hope
you won´t think it presumptuous...
...if I say you shouId sit
before you faII down.
He thinks you´re gonna faint
because he´s a Negro.
WeII....
I don´t think I´m going to faint.
But I´II sit down anyway.
Can´t we aII sit down?
WeII, I....
I suppose it wouId be aII right
if I said, ´´ My goodness,´´ wouIdn´t it?
WeII, my goodness.
-Do we mind her saying ´´ My goodness´´?
-I don´t mind.
-Did you teII them about me?
-Yes.
They said I sounded serious and asked
if you were pretty. I said yes.
They said this was a big surprise.
I said it was.
Did you teII them I´m not
a coIoured girI?
I didn´t. It was shocking for the phone.
PeopIe wiII think we´re shocking.
-Isn´t that right, Mrs. Drayton?
-I know what you mean.
-TiIIie´s made food. Let´s go outside.
-Yes, Iet´s.
-Come on, Dr. Prentice.
-I´II expIain it in two minutes.
John was Iecturing
at Hawaii University.
We met at the Dean´s party,
and afterward we went for a drive.
Since then, we´ve been
somewhere together every night.
John was fIying back to Los AngeIes
on Saturday to see his parents.
That´s where they Iive.
Thank you, TiIIie.
Try one of these. They´re great.
-Coffee?
-No, thanks.
-Does your father know you´re back?
-Not yet.
-Do you think he´d come back earIy--?
-Yes, he´s pIaying goIf.
MarveIIous! He´II meet John
and we can aII taIk over dinner.
John´s fIying to New York tonight
to see a friend at CoIumbia.
Tomorrow he´s fIying to Geneva
for the WorId HeaIth Organization.
I´II fIy to Geneva next week
so we can be married.
-That´s the whoIe situation.
-In a nutsheII.
Except he thinks the fact he´s a Negro
and I´m not is a big probIem.
Does he?
I´ve toId him that it wouIdn´t
matter to you or Dad.
He won´t beIieve me.
That´s why we´re here.
That´s why he watches you so cIoseIy
whiIe pretending not to at aII.
She´s right. I´m sorry. I toId her
not to spring this on you so suddenIy.
You can teII your father
you met someone in Hawaii--
-Now, reaIIy!
-Give him time to adjust--
But what for?
He stiII has to be toId, doesn´t he?
You shouId make up your minds
because that´s his car.
-Mr. Matt?
-Hi, TiIIie.
-AII heII´s done broke Ioose!
-The waste disposaI?
It ain´t that.
-What happened? Where´s Christina?
-On the terrace with Joey...
...and someone caIIed Dr. Prentice.
Doctor? What´s wrong?
What´s happened?
Joey?
Here he comes.
-Daddy!
-What´s happened?
-TiIIie said there was a doctor--
-Dr. John Prentice. This is my dad.
-PIeased to meet you.
-How are you?
-Is something wrong?
-I decided to come home earIy.
We met in Hawaii and fIew back today.
Oh! Sit down. I thought something
was reaIIy wrong. TiIIie said--
TiIIie´s behaving very strangeIy.
Coffee?
No, thanks. I´m pIaying goIf
with Monsignor Ryan.
What´s the matter?
Are you having a chiII?
No, darIing. I´m fine, I....
Doctor?
Are you practicing in San Francisco?
-Sit down.
-No, sir. I am just here for one day.
Where is your practice? Hawaii?
No, I´m not estabIished
in any one pIace.
I´m in tropicaI medicines,
mostIy in Africa.
-That sounds interesting.
-Everything about him is interesting.
I´m sure. I wish I had more time.
-Excuse me--
-CouIdn´t you stay and taIk?
I´d Iove to, but I´II be Iate.
I´II see you Iater, doctor?
-You certainIy wiII.
-Good.
-Dr. Prentice wiII be here for dinner.
-Fine. Then you can teII me--
And there´s a Iot to teII,
isn´t there?
Fine. See you aII Iater.
What the heII is going on here?
-This doesn´t make sense.
-I toId you.
What? If you don´t expIain
what you three are pIaying at--
-I can expIain it.
-You can? Let´s have it.
WeII, it´s my fauIt. You see,
we have a sort of a situation here.
We didn´t just meet in Hawaii.
We spent a Iot of time together.
I mean, aII the time after we met.
And, weII, we have this probIem.
I feII in Iove with her.
And as incredibIe as it may seem,
she feII in Iove with me.
And we fIew back to San Francisco...
...to see if either of you had
any objections if we got married.
Joanna just toId her mother.
I had the stupid idea
that maybe there was some way to...
...break this gentIy.
-Daddy! You´re making us nervous.
-Am I?
I wouIdn´t want to make anybody
nervous. Chris, are you nervous?
Sit down, doctor,
before you make me nervous.
WouId anybody Iike coffee?
What did she say
when Joanna toId her?
-Did she raise any objections?
-None so far.
What objections?
I know this is a shock,
because it´s aII so unexpected.
I never thought I´d
faII in Iove with a Negro...
...but I did, and nothing in
the worId wiII change that.
Even if you were the governor
of AIabama, I wouIdn´t Iet him go.
I mean, if Mom were.
So teII him, wiII you?
TeII John if you have objections,
then you can pIay goIf.
What is it you expect me to say?
You have to give me time
to think about this.
You certainIy have got a probIem.
If you´re expecting a sensibIe
statement, I need time to think.
-Does that sound reasonabIe?
-Yes, but not quite practicaI.
You see, Matt, there´s sort of
a speciaI probIem.
I´m fIying to New York tonight,
and on to SwitzerIand tomorrow.
Yes, and what Joey proposes
is to go to Geneva herseIf...
...so they can marry
in the next few weeks.
-What the heII´s the rush?
-We know we want to get married.
UnIess there are objections,
why shouId we waste time?
John and I aren´t
gonna change our minds.
Are you teIIing me...
...that you want an answer today
about how your mother and I feeI?
Yes. We want you and Mom to state...
...that you have no
objections whatever.
And when we do marry,
we´II have your bIessing.
-Are you gonna pIay goIf, or no?
-No.
I´II caII it off. Excuse me, doctor.
-And that´s my dad. Do you Iike him?
-I don´t know. Does he Iike me?
With his American-eagIe face,
no one can teII what he´s thinking.
I don´t think he Iiked any of us
after the way we began.
Give John more coffee.
She´s beautifuI, Joanna.
She´s even better Iooking than you.
HeIIo, Edie?
Two things, Edie, both of them urgent.
CaII up Monsignor Ryan,
teII him I can´t pIay today.
TeII him something´s come up,
something personaI at home.
Then caII the Iibrary and see what
they have on a John Wade Prentice.
Prentice. A doctor of medicine,
feIIow of about 35, 36.
-Oh, Matt!
-He´s a coIoured feIIow.
If they haven´t got anything,
caII up the MedicaI Association.
Get anything you can.
Hurry it up and caII me back.
-There´s no necessity for that.
-It can´t do any harm.
But, Matt! Joey said he was Iecturing
at the university in Hawaii.
Did it ever occur to you
that this might happen?
No.
Never occurred to me either. Not once.
TeII me your reaction.
How do you feeI?
I don´t know. I was shaken at first.
I stiII am, I suppose.
But they mean what they´re saying.
They know what they´re doing.
They may mean what they say, but
they don´t know what they´re doing.
-If I´m not intruding?
-Of course not. PIease come in.
I´d Iike a coupIe of minutes
with the two of you, if I may.
Sure, doctor. Come on in.
There´s something you both
ought to know. I made a decision.
Joanna doesn´t know about it,
and she shouIdn´t.
What is it, doctor?
Joanna thinks that our future
is settIed...
...but there is no reaI commitment.
Up to now, nothing is settIed at aII.
I don´t understand. She said you´d
marry no matter what we think.
That´s not the case.
UnIess you two approve,
there won´t be any marriage.
Why, John?
Why have you decided that?
Mrs. Drayton,
this happened so quickIy...
...I´m just as startIed
as you must be.
Two weeks ago it´d be inconceivabIe.
But two weeks ago
I had not met Joanna.
She´s not at aII
Iike anyone I´ve ever known.
It´s not just that our coIour
difference doesn´t matter to her.
It´s that she doesn´t seem to think
there is any difference.
This has come up at a time
when I have aII the probIems I need.
I can´t afford to get married if it
meant taking on speciaI probIems...
...in addition to those we´II have.
When you say ´´speciaI probIems,´´
doctor, what do you mean?
WeII....
Your attitude, Mr. Drayton...
...and yours, Mrs. Drayton.
Joanna is very cIose to both of you.
If marrying me damaged
her reIationship with either of you...
...the pain of it
wouId be too much for her.
I wouIdn´t know how to deaI
with that kind of situation.
I wouIdn´t want to try.
I´m gIad you toId us this.
Don´t misunderstand me.
I Iove your daughter.
I´d do anything to keep her
as happy as the day we met.
But it seems that without your approvaI
we wiII make no sense at aII.
That is why I am asking
for a cIear statement...
...of what your attitude wiII be.
I appreciate that, doctor.
It´s aImost in the form
of an uItimatum.
Not quite, Mr. Drayton.
AII you have to say is ´´Goodbye.´´
WeII, that´s where it´s at.
Thank you for the opportunity
to speak my piece.
WeII? StiII think you ought
to have someone check on him?
-No.
-He´s right about Joey too.
-You know that, don´t you?
-Yes.
Thank God. That´s how I feeI,
thank God he´s right.
She´s 23 years oId...
...and she is exactIy how
we brought her up to be.
We answered her questions.
We toId her it was wrong...
...to beIieve that white peopIe
were superior to bIack peopIe...
...or brown, or red, or yeIIow ones.
PeopIe thinking that way were wrong...
...sometimes hatefuI, usuaIIy stupid,
but aIways, aIways wrong.
That´s what we said.
And when we said it, we did not add:
´´ But don´t ever faII in Iove
with a coIoured man.´´
-Edie, Mr. Drayton.
-What is it, Edie?
He´s an important guy.

-There´s a lot more here.
-No, that´s aII right. Thanks.
-What´s the $2.20?
-He caIIed his parents in Los AngeIes.
I guess he doesn´t bum
free teIephone caIIs either.
I understand why
he didn´t taIk about himseIf.
Who the heII wouId beIieve him?
-I beg your pardon, Iady!
-Loves me, Ioves me not.
WeII, what do you think?
-Aren´t they the way I said they were?
-They´re speciaI--
ShaII I teII you something?
For a whoIe week, I´ve been nervous.
No! I don´t beIieve--
Just about their first reaction.
I thought they might Iet me down
for the first haIf-hour!
You´re a phony, you know that?
You´re a big phony!
WeII?
She´s aIways been a happy human being.
She Iaughed out Ioud
before she was six months oId.
She was happy as a baby,
happy as a IittIe girI...
...happy aII through schooI
and coIIege.
But I don´t think I´ve ever seen her
quite so happy as she is right now.
And I have to be happy
for her, Matt...
...and I am.
I feeI happy for her.
And proud of the fact
that we heIped to make her.
And whatever happens now,
I feeI gIad that Joey is Joey.
How are you today?
Having a steak fry?
WeII, now, there she is!
How are you today?
-Give me a Iift to Market Street?
-You know it, doII!
I hope it´s better
than the Iast we had.
I just deIiver it,
I don´t rustIe the cow.
You said to remind you
to open the wine.
CiviI rights is one thing.
This here is something eIse.
I went out onto the terrace.
Oh, it was so beautifuI!
It was dark and the moon was rising.
I didn´t see him because of the view,
but he was standing there.
Then, aII of a sudden,
he moved, and I jumped.
And he just stood there,
Iooking at me, and sort of--
-You´re burning your shirt.
-Oh, yes. Sort of smiIing.
´´ HeIIo,´´ I said.
´´Who are you?´´
And I think he thought I was,
you know, attractive.
FinaIIy he said, ´´WeII, do you think
it couId possibIy matter?´´
-And it´s just crazy, and I admit it--
-You´d better Iet me do this.
But 20 minutes Iater
I feIt I was in Iove with him.
Mom, how Iong did it take you
to faII in Iove with Dad?
WeII, nothing so Iong as 20 minutes!
Is that reaIIy true? Oh, Mom!
I wanna ask you something.
How deepIy are you and John invoI--?
No, I have no right--
Do you mean
have we been to bed together?
I don´t mind you asking me that.
We haven´t.
He wouIdn´t.
He couIdn´t have doubted
my feeIings, but he wouIdn´t.
You´re burning my shirt.
He´s been concerned the whoIe time
about my getting hurt somehow.
They´re stiII taIking. You´d think
everything was said by now.
You say they don´t have
any speciaI sense of rhythm?
That´s right.
But you can see it. You can´t turn on
the TV without seeing kids dancing.
-The coIoured dance better.
-But there´s an expIanation.
It´s our dancing and our music.
We brought it here.
You can do the watusi,
but we are the Watusi...
...if you know what I mean.
When I was your age,
my sports editor toId me...
...that Negroes wouId never
be abIe to pIay basebaII.
WiIIie Mays couId be eIected
mayor of San Francisco.
I own a newspaper, but I couIdn´t
be eIected dogcatcher.
You don´t want that any more
than he wants to be mayor.
No, I suppose that´s right.
Doctor, we´ve taIked about
a good many things...
...but there´s one we haven´t.
Have you considered the probIems
of your chiIdren?
Yes, and they´II have some.
We´II have chiIdren,
or you couIdn´t caII it a marriage.
Is that how Joey feeIs?
She feeIs that our every
chiId wiII be president...
...and they´II aII
have coIourfuI administrations.
WeII, you made her, Mr. Drayton.
I just met her in Hawaii.
But how do you feeI
about that probIem?
FrankIy, your daughter
is a bit optimistic.
I´d settIe for secretary of state.
WouId you think it cowardice
if I toId you that...
...no matter how confident you are,
I´m scared?
No, it wouIdn´t.
But you never know.
Things are changing.
They´re not changing anywhere
as fast as in my own backyard.
TeII me this. Don´t you think
this quick decision...
...about how we feeI
is just a IittIe unfair?
In a way, I do.
But it wasn´t my idea that
everything be settIed so quickIy.
Your daughter said there´s no probIem.
´´ My Dad´s a Iife-Iong fighting
IiberaI who Ioathes race prejudice...
...and fights discrimination.´´
She said, ´´ My parents
wiII weIcome you with open arms.´´
And I said,
´´Oh, I sure wanna meet them.´´
John! TeIephone, it´s Los AngeIes.
-Take it in my study.
-Thank you.
-Dr. Prentice?
-Yes, this is he.
-Hello.
-Hi, Dad.
-Dr. Graves caII again?
-No, it´s not that, son.
I had an idea. What would you say
to us flying there for the evening?
-This evening?
-Could be there at 6.;30.
I thought we could
take you both out....
-Invite them to dinner!
-Just a minute!
Dad, I´m having dinner with her foIks.
-They´re invited!
-That the young lady?
That´s her. Just a minute.
You haven´t asked your mother--
Mr. Prentice, wiII you come to dinner?
John and I wiII meet your pIane.
-Who am I talking to? John?
-Hi.
Looks like she wants us.
We certainly wanna meet her.
-So we´ll see you at 6.;30.
-Oh, no, no.
Your mother says she´s pleased.
Hell, he knows thatl
-All right, son. We´ll see you later.
-Dad? Dad!
What´s the matter with you?
-Mom!
-Yeah?
John´s parents are coming to dinner.
Oh! Good. MarveIIous.
-We´II meet their pIane at 6:30.
-Fine. TeII TiIIie.
Okay.
Joanna, I toId you.
My foIks, they don´t--
-They think you´re coIoured.
-Why?
-I was gonna write.
-What difference is it?
You think they won´t come?
CaII and teII them.
-They´II know when I go meet them.
-I´II meet them.
-It gives me a chance to expIain--
-Why do you dramatize everything?
We´re meeting Peter and Judith
for a drink at 5:30.
There´s time to get to the airport.
She´s my best friend.
You´ve just got to Iet them meet you.
-Did he teII you about his pIan?
-No. What?
It´s the damnedest thing.
They put a medicaI schooI on trucks,
run into some African country...
...pick up the brightest
native kids...
...and give them courses.
Like the U.S. Army Corps.
His idea is that they´re aII
speciaIists trained to do one thing.
Like sewing up a wound,
or deIivering a baby, what have you.
They go where peopIe never heard
of an aspirin...
...Iet aIone a doctor.
Imagine what that means.
For every 1 000 kids they train,
they can save a miIIion Iives a year.
He seems to have made
quite an impression on you.
I asked him how he got so far.
He´s onIy 37.
He said he thought
he got the best breaks...
...because no one wanted him
to think they were prejudiced.
Yeah, he made an impression.
I couIdn´t fauIt him.
-Are you trying to fauIt him?
-Of course not.
You know his father´s a maiIman?
Retired in Los AngeIes.
How do you suppose
a coIoured maiIman...
...produced a son
with aII the quaIities he has?
-You´II find out this evening.
-What?
-Guess who´s coming to dinner?
-Who?
You mean-- His parents?
Now, wait a minute.
-Whose idea was that?
-Joey invited them.
We´re being pressurized.
You know that, don´t you?
First there was no marriage
unIess we approved.
Then we had one day to decide.
Now we´re entertaining somebody
we´ve never heard of! What the heII--?
Don´t Iook at my baby pictures!
That´s at KIosters the year--
I´II get it, TiIIie! Just a second.
-Monsignor Ryan, how wonderfuI!
-Good afternoon.
But why are you here, not in Hawaii?
What probIem caused your father
to chicken out of goIf?
-And who is this gentIeman?
-This is Dr. John Wade Prentice.
We met in Hawaii
and we´re gonna be married.
Are you indeed?
I take it you mean to each other?
Dr. Prentice.
Of course, you´re the probIem.
I´m afraid I am.
Why haven´t your parents informed me?
They didn´t know either.
Excuse me a second,
I forgot to teII TiIIie something.
-I suppose this was aII very sudden?
-Yes.
-Have you two had time to consider it?
-No, we´ve not.
We´II be two more for dinner.
-How many steaks?
-I got four. I was toId four.
Order two more because
the doctor´s parents are coming.
-His father and mother, here?!
-That´s right.
If the butcher can´t send them,
send a taxi.
It´s more Iike a HoIy RoIIers´
meeting every minute!
I know about you! I read an articIe
about you in Commonweal.
I shaII want to taIk
to you about that.
Are you aware this feIIow´s
a very important man?
WhoIIy aware of it.
When we´re married, I´II be important.
I daresay you wiII,
as a matter of fact.
-Where´s ArnoId PaImer?
-In the garden.
Just go on with what you´re doing.
Fore!
Of aII our friends, he´s the cIosest.
We´re not CathoIics...
...but he and Dad and Mom
sat on committees and things.
He´s a wonderfuI man, and we Iove him.
You´re a remarkabIe feIIow, Mike!
You get younger every minute.
-Did you...?
-Yes! I´ve just seen him.
Handsome feIIow.
LittIe Joey´s not Iess than radiant.
It warms me chiIIy oId heart
Iooking at her.
-Aren´t you a IittIe shocked?
-Shocked? Why shouId I be shocked?
I´ve known many cases
of marriages between races.
StrangeIy enough, they usuaIIy
work out weII. I don´t know why.
Maybe because it takes
a speciaI quaIity of effort.
More consideration, compassion...
...than most marriages
generate these days.
-CouId that be it?
-Yes, it couId.
I´m gIad you said that.
That´s a beautifuI thought.
You do have beautifuI thoughts.
It´s my trade, you know.
What about Iaddie over here?
You making heavy weather of it?
You know, this man is quite
a famous feIIow.
He´s done incredibIe work in Asia
and some awfuI pIace in Africa.
Mom! HiIary´s here.
She wants to see you.
Excuse me. Express some more
beautifuI thoughts to the Iad.
Thank you.
I hope you won´t think I´m prying,
but, naturaIIy, one is curious.
NaturaIIy.
Dr. Prentice and I
are gonna be married, HiIary.
Are you?
I didn´t even know.
Christina hadn´t even mentioned it.
-She didn´t know. It was a surprise.
-A surprise?
WeII, I shouId think it was!
Joey teIIs me congratuIations
are in order. You didn´t even know.
What´s the probIem, HiIary?
What brings you up here?
Mr. CazeIet phoned about the--
Oh, that. Excuse us, wiII you?
I´II waIk out to your car with you.
I hope I´II see you shortIy.
Dr. Prentice is Ieaving tonight,
and Joey within the next two weeks.
Then you must permit me
to wish you every happiness.
Come aIong, HiIary.
Christina! My poor dear,
what a shock for you.
I knew something was up, but this?
What are you going to do?
-The chiId is of age--
-Yes, the chiId is 23.
Why didn´t you simpIy ring up
with the CazeIet information?
I must admit, I was intenseIy curious.
I couIdn´t beIieve it. It´s unIike
Joey to do anything so stupid!
-Come aIong.
-What you must be going through!
You must try not to worry about it.
I have some instructions. Go back
to the gaIIery. Start your motor.
TeII Jennifer she´II
Iook after things temporariIy.
She´s to caII if there´s
anything she needs.
Then go into the office and make out
a check for the sum of $5000.
Then carefuIIy, HiIary,
remove absoIuteIy everything...
...that might remind me
you were ever there...
...incIuding the yeIIow thing
with bIue buIbs you Iike.
Then take the check for $5000,
which I feeI you deserve...
...and get permanentIy Iost.
It´s not that I don´t
want to know you...
...it´s just that we´re not
the sort of peopIe...
...that you can afford
to associate with.
Don´t speak, HiIary, just go.
You see that boy? If he´d pIayed his
cards right, you´d never met me!
-He feII for some girI from Pomona.
-That´II teach him.
You know what HiIary was doing?
She was being an absoIute bitch!
I wish you´d fire her, I reaIIy do!
Joey! How can you be so hard?
She has a ruthIess streak, John.
Be warned about it.
She gets it from her father.
They need aII the heIp
you can give them.
They´re gonna have
speciaI difficuIties--
-Christina!
-Don´t budge, pIease. Sit.
Of course, they know aII that.
They´re serious, inteIIigent peopIe.
If they know what Iies in store...
...and want each other
enough to accept it...
...then they Iove each other
very much.
Any two peopIe
who Iove each other that much...
...deserve aII the best Iuck
in the worId.
I don´t know. I have the feeIing
that they´II never make it.
That the whoIe thing´s impossibIe.
You feeI that way, do you?
You´re reaIIy thrashing about, then.
That´s very interesting, indeed.
And rather amusing too...
...to see a broken-down phony IiberaI
facing his principIes.
I aIways beIieved that under
the fighting IiberaI façade...
...there must be a reactionary bigot
trying to get out.
Oh, go to heII! You and your crowd
are stiII preaching heII.
WeII, I´m off!
As much as I enjoy your discomfort,
I can save a few souIs before supper.
But I am, as it happens,
free for dinner--
PIease come, 7.30. The doctor´s
famiIy are fIying up from Los AngeIes.
Oh! WeII, in that case,
you´II actuaIIy need me.
Otherwise, you won´t even
outnumber the bIacks!
Thank you, my dear!
HaIf past 7.
What was that the BeatIes sang?
-Mom did it. Does it Iook Iike him?
-He Iooks a IittIe grim--
-Hey!
-No, no. Don´t Iet me disturb you.
I hope you don´t mind,
but I´m coming to dinner.
-I´m deIighted you´re coming!
-Thank you.
I´m very deIighted to have met you.
See you this evening.
You know, you two make me feeI...
...quite extraordinariIy happy!
I´d better teII TiIIie. Listen, you´II
hear her going through the roof.
I´ve brought you the Iatest buIIetin.
Guess who´s coming to dinner now.
-The Reverend Martin Luther King?
-Oh, TiIIie!
You´re so cIose! Monsignor Ryan.
Bake a second pie.
He Ioves your cooking.
Is the big guest room in order?
Dr. Prentice wants to have a shower.
-He does?
-He does.
She´s 23. She has the right
to do as she pIeases.
-That´s not the point. He said--
-I know what he said.
CouId we go for a few minutes?
What are the others doing?
Meeting Peter and Judith,
then going to the airport.
Come on!
WeII, come on, wiII you?!
What happened to Homer, that Iawyer?
I thought she Iiked him a Iot.
Nothing happened.
Dr. Prentice happened to Joey.
OnIy Iast Christmas she said
Homer had the inside track.
That´s where we got the ice cream.
Let´s get some.
-Oh, Matt, it´s after 5!
-A IittIe ice cream can´t hurt!
Yes?
When I had ice cream before, I had
a speciaI fIavour I Iiked very much.
-I can´t remember.
-I´II bring the Iist.
You must know what it is.
Daiquiri ice, honeycomb candy,
cocoa-coconut...
...mocha jamoca, peanut butter,
banana mint?
-Must´ve been another pIace.
-Fresh Oregon boysenberry.
That´s it! That´s it!
That´s it. Fresh Oregon boysenberry.
Bring me a big one, huh?
-WiII you have some?
-No, bIack coffee.
One doubIe fresh Oregon boysenberry
and one bIack coffee. Thank you.
You know, Matt...
...I think Mike was right,
that Joey is Iucky.
The work he does is so important.
She´II be abIe...
...to share it aII with him.
It´s the best break.
For us it´s aII been great.
But do you know what was
the best time of aII?
The beginning, when we struggIed.
You were working too hard and
worried, sometimes frightened.
And there were times when I feIt,
when I reaIIy knew...
...that I was a heIp to you.
That was the very best time
of aII for me.
-Okay. One bIack coffee.
-Thank you.
-And one Oregon boysenberry sherbert.
-Thank you.
This is not the stuff.
I never had this before.
You know, it´s not bad at aII.
I kind of Iike it.
Fresh Oregon boysenberry.
Yes, sir?
When I had ice cream before,
this isn´t the stuff I had.
But I Iike it, it´s very good.
I Iike it very much.
-How do you do, Miss Binks?
-I got something to say!
Just exactIy what
are you trying to puII here?
I´m not puIIing anything.
I was finding me a wife.
Ain´t that just IikeIy?
What kind of doctor are you
supposed to be?
WouId you beIieve horse?
You make with witticisms and aII, huh?
You may think you´re fooIing these
foIks, but you ain´t fooIing me.
You´re a smooth-taIking,
smart-ass nigger...
...out for aII you can get...
...with aII that other
troubIe-making nonsense.
I brought up that chiId,
and ain´t nobody gonna harm her.
As Iong as you´re here,
I´m watching. You read me, boy?
You bring troubIe, you´II know
what ´´ bIack power´´ means!
And furthermore, you ain´t even
aII that good-Iooking!
That was good. If I come again,
remind me about the boysenberry.
Yeah, I sure wiII. Thank you, sir.
-ShaII we take some home for dessert?
-No. TiIIie´s baked pies.
You stupid idiot!
-Can´t you Iook where you´re going?
-Your car´s so Iow, I couIdn´t see--
Of course you didn´t see me!
You weren´t Iooking!
-Look what you did!
-Okay, it´s my fauIt. My insurance--
Who cares about your insurance?
I worked three months on that!
-How much to have it repaired?
-Look at it! 30 or 40 bucks.
Stupid oId man! You ought to be
put away in a home.
There´s 50. Don´t bother
to have it fixed. Buy a new one!
Some of these oId guys,
there´re seniIe!
Stupid oId man!
There ought to be a Iaw!
There ought to be a Iaw!
What the heII is it today?
Less than 1 2 percent of this city
are coIoured.
I can´t even have a dish of Oregon
boozenberry without running into one!
I can´t teII you how happy
I am for you.
It aII happened so quickIy.
It took Peter and me three years
to get married.
We Iived together for two.
-To John and Joey.
-John and Joanna.
-He onIy caIIs me Joanna. I Iike it.
-To John and Joanna.
You know, where you´re so Iucky
is in Joey´s foIks.
Matt Drayton reaIIy
stands for something in this town.
-It´s aIways been a good paper.
-And he made it that way.
Matt takes a stand on aII
pubIic issues.
-When are you fIying over?
-As soon as I can arrange everything.
Why aren´t you fIying over with John?
Why am I not fIying over with you?
-Why am I not fIying with you?
-Is your passport in order?
-Need anything?
-I couId get it there.
Then it seems crazy to go aII that way
when you couId go together.
-Why don´t you both Ieave tonight?
-Why not?
Yes.
It´s 6:00. In an hour they´II be here.
The doctor Ieaves at 1 0:45.
No matter what it is, you
have to teII them how you feeI.
I need more than one day
to make a decision Iike that.
It´s the siIIiest thing.
But I´II say this:
I won´t try to pretend
that I´m happy about it. I´m not.
If the doctor´s decision depends
on that, then it´s too bad.
I´m thinking onIy of Joey´s weIfare.
I have nothing against him,
but he´s a grown man...
...and he behaved irresponsibIy
by Ietting it happen.
Now he wants me
to approve a situation...
...when I know they´II
get their brains knocked out!
Sorry, that´s the way I feeI.
And I know how you´re reacting.
You´re so wrapped up
in Joey´s excitement...
...that you are not behaving
in her best interest.
There´s no reason not to go tonight.
You can understand, can´t you, Mom?
My passport´s in order, I don´t need
anything. I can pack in an hour.
I´II be with him.
We´II be together the whoIe time.
Mom, they´re here. I can see them.
They Iook Iike awfuIIy nice peopIe.
His mother is IoveIy!
Break it to Dad for me, wiII you?
WeII....
I shouId´ve caIIed you back again,
because there is one thing I....
I´ve been meaning to write to you.
There´s one thing I didn´t expIain.
And I´m afraid it´s gonna
be kind of a shock.
If you see what I mean.
Mom, Dad, this is Joanna Drayton.
Joanna, my mom, my dad.
Mrs. Prentice, I´m so happy.
-Miss Drayton?
-Yes.
Mr. Prentice,
I´m very pIeased to meet you.
I can expIain.
I can imagine
what´s going on in your mind...
...but we can expIain.
-You can?
-Of course we can.
You have bags?
Of course you have bags.
Let´s go get your bags.
Mama.
-What did your foIks say?
-AII´s weII.
-Did you taIk with your father?
-To Mom, but she´II teII him.
-Tonight?
-I thought I ought to teII you.
This whoIe thing--
That´s out of the question.
I couIdn´t do what you´re doing, so
I don´t understand how you´II do it.
You can´t break their hearts
and then sit down to dinner.
Don´t you think I know that?
I´II taIk to the doctor after dinner.
TeII him exactIy how I feeI.
Matt, I´m not trying to argue.
There´s nothing to say
that you don´t know.
But it´s important how wrong
I think you--
You´re making the worst mistake--
I think you´II regret it
for as Iong as you Iive.
You´re as wrong as you can be.
I´m thinking of her.
Even the doctor´s gonna know that.
There´s something eIse. I´m
surprised it hasn´t occurred to you.
The doctor wiII accept it
because he´s sensitive...
...and because he said he wouId.
But Joey won´t. Your mistake is in
underestimating your daughter.
She´II fight you and every argument
you ever try to give her.
And one thing more.
UntiI today I´d never have beIieved
I couId say such a thing.
But when she fights you,
and for what it´s worth...
...I´m going to be on her side.
I never wouId´ve beIieved
I´d hear you say a thing Iike that.
Damn it!
-Can I get you another drink?
-No, thanks. I´II get it.
I wish we had more time--
What were you gonna say?
I was gonna ask Miss Drayton
how her parents reacted to--
-I wanted to ask that too.
-PIease caII me Joanna.
I don´t think I´ve seen
them so surprised.
What reaIIy shook them was
that I wanted to marry anybody.
I can´t bIame them for being stunned.
Then you couIdn´t bIame us
if we were a IittIe stunned too.
It´s not unreasonabIe
to suggest that...
...you two are behaving Iike
escaped Iunatics!
Dad...
...this happened so quickIy.
It´s Iike riding a rocket.
We didn´t pIan it,
it just went that way.
It´s hard on Joanna´s foIks,
and it´II be hard on you.
If you have any objections,
you´d better raise them soon...
...because in exactIy four hours
we´II be gone.
I can´t Iist aII my objections
in four hours. I´d need eight hours.
You´ve onIy got four hours, so you´II
have to taIk twice as fast.
-Christina!
-HeIIo, darIing. How are you?
-Forgive me. I´m a IittIe bit earIy.
-Ego absolvo te. Come in.
I don´t Iike to be
aIways repeating myseIf...
...but how Iong since I remarked...
...that you are the IoveIiest woman
I´ve ever known?
There is a kind of envy
that is in no way sinfuI.
That´s what I´ve had for Matt.
-What can I get you to drink?
-I Iike Scotch.
-But aren´t we drinking wine?
-Yes.
I´II have a drop of Scotch anyhow.
EquaI amount of soda, pIease.
Thank you.
My dear! What´s the matter?
We´re in troubIe, Mike.
We´re in terribIe troubIe,
terribIe troubIe.
John toId Matt and me
that he wouIdn´t marry Joey...
...unIess we´d approve
with no reservations whatever.
Joey doesn´t know he said that.
Now she´s decided to go
with him tonight.
They´re on their way
with John´s parents.
Neither of them knows
that Matt has decided....
Matt has decided that
he can´t approve.
That´s not true.
PIease teII me it´s not true.
-Where is Matt?
-He´s upstairs, changing. He´s--
He´s not himseIf, Mike.
Excuse me.
It´s incredibIe!
-TabIe aII right?
-It´s fine, TiIIie. Thank you.
Miss Christina,
what´s gonna happen here?
I don´t know, TiIIie.
You and Mr. Matt gonna put a stop
to this damn nonsense fooIishness?
TiIIie, I don´t want
to put a stop to anything.
He´s a fine man.
He´s a wonderfuI man.
And Joey is
very much in Iove with him.
And it isn´t just
´´damn nonsense fooIishness.´´
I teII you, the way you´re taIking...
...I don´t understand nothing no more.
Nobody understands nothing no more.
No, I don´t think you´re butting
in about what doesn´t concern--
Damn, bIast!
I understand how you feeI, Mike.
I understand how everybody feeIs.
But understand, they´ve boxed me
into a heII of a corner here.
And no matter what anyone says,
I won´t behave irresponsibIy.
I´m not gonna teII them
they can´t get married.
But they have no right to expect me
to be happy when--
For God´s sake!
You´re about to destroy
aII the happiness there is...
...in the happiest famiIy
I´ve ever known.
-Have you any thought for Christina?
-Christina?
Have you any idea
of how she has behaved today?
She was aII for it as though
there were no probIems.
But there are no probIems
they don´t know about.
Christina respects Joey´s judgment
more than you.
Come off it! If Joey came home
with some fuzzy-wuzzy and said:
´Mom, this is the man for me,´
Christina wouId say, ´´ How wonderfuI!
Where wiII we get enough roses
to fiII the Rose BowI?´´
I´m trying to remember
where I´ve seen you so angry.
When you took nine shots
on the 7th green.
-CouId you get the heII out of here?
-I know why you´re angry.
Not with the doctor, not with
Joey or Christina, not even with me.
-You´re angry with yourseIf.
-You pontificating oId poop!
You´re angry because
suddenIy you´ve been thrown.
You´re the Iast man
I´d expect to behave this way.
You´re not yourseIf! You don´t know
who you are, or what you´re doing.
That´s it! You´ve gone back on
yourseIf. In your heart, you know it.
I´II onIy take so much,
even from you!
For 30 years, there´s been no man
I´ve admired or respected more.
You know that, Matt.
And for the first time in aII those
30 years, I feeI sorry for you.
That´s enough!
Are you reaIIy capabIe of putting
yourseIf in my position?
UnIess you´ve got kids
of your own somewhere...
...how couId you know how a father
feeIs in this situation?
You don´t know! I know
they won´t have a dog´s chance...
...not here, not in the whoIe
stinking worId!
They are this country.
They´II change this stinking worId.
In 50 years, maybe, or 1 00 years...
...but not in your Iifetime.
Nor in mine.
My dear friend, I wish with aII my
heart you couId be restrained.
If I were younger, to prevent you
from going downstairs...
...I´d make an effort
to wrestIe you to the fIoor!
That´II be the day!
Is that the car? Did you hear a car?
-Mrs. Prentice! I´m Christina Drayton.
-How do you do?
How do you do?
I´m so pIeased to meet you.
Let me take your coat and hat.
And yours, Mrs. Prentice?
How good of you to come
aII this Iong way. Do go in.
-Did you teII him? Was he shaken?
-It was a surprise.
-Does he wanna taIk to me?
-I´m sure he does, Iater.
-May I get you a drink?
-May I have some sherry, pIease?
-What a IoveIy room.
-John, wouId you be bartender?
ShaII we sit over here?
-What wiII you have, Dad? Bourbon?
-Thank you.
-You have such a magnificent view.
-Thank you. PIease sit down.
Sit down, Mr. Prentice.
-Did you have a pIeasant fIight?
-Very pIeasant, thank you.
The view of the sunset
was breathtaking.
OnIy took 40 minutes.
Four hundred miIes.
It´s incredibIe, isn´t it?
My husband wiII be down directIy, I think.
He´s upstairs changing.
And we have a friend coming to dinner,
Monsignor Ryan.
-They´II be down in a minute.
-Mrs. Prentice. Mom.
-Here you are, Dad.
-Thanks, son.
Are you CathoIics, Mrs. Drayton?
No, we´re not, Mr. Prentice.
We´re nothing in particuIar.
Monsignor Ryan is an oId friend.
Do you come often to San Francisco?
-I´ve got to taIk to your father.
-There he is.
Dad, I´d Iike you to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Prentice.
-This is my father.
-Mrs. Prentice, nice to meet you.
Mr. Prentice, happy to meet you.
May I present Monsignor Ryan?
-How do you do?
-GIad to meet you, sir.
-Are you tending bar?
-Yes.
-We´re both drinking Scotch.
-Coming up.
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down, there, Mike.
-Did you have a nice fIight?
-Very nice fIight.
OnIy 40 minutes.
-OnIy 40 minutes from L.A.
-Terrifying.
You couId taIk
about fIying to Geneva...
...because John and I hope
you´II come for the wedding.
WouId anybody Iike to taIk about that?
I take it they´ve toId you
aII about their pIans.
Of course.
OnIy eIoping is a secret.
I don´t know about you, Mr. Prentice...
...but I think they´re rushing it a bit.
It seemed that way to me too.
-It seems Iike that to you too?
-That´s right.
I´m certainIy reIieved to hear that.
I was beginning to think
I was the onIy one--
I wouId Iike Mrs. Prentice
to see the view.
-What are you taIking about? What view?
-From the terrace.
-WouId you care to see the view?
-Yes, thank you.
Good. Excuse us.
Bring your drink, that´s fine.
Mrs. Prentice, have you had any
chance to speak privateIy with John?
WeII, no.
It´s important you know
what´s happened...
...and what I´m terribIy
afraid wiII happen.
May I expIain the situation
to you, or try to?
-Yes, pIease. I wish you wouId.
-First I have to ask you--
Forgive my being so abrupt
and so direct.
Are you shocked by the fact...
...that John´s invoIved with a white girI?
Yes, surprised.
It never happened before.
I guess it never occurred to me
that such a thing might happen.
But it wouIdn´t be true
to say that I´m shocked.
Are you, Mrs. Drayton?
WeII, I think I was at first,
this afternoon...
...because it came as a surprise
to us too.
But now I know how
they feeI about each other.
Joey´s very young, Mrs. Prentice,
but she´s not a chiId.
And they´re deepIy
in Iove with each other.
Are you teIIing me that you´d
approve the marriage...
...but that your husband won´t?
Is that it?
Yes, that´s it.
My husband won´t, either.
I wish there were more time,
just to adjust to the situation...
...but there just isn´t any time.
If we´re going to accept it...
...we´II have to trust the two of them...
...and accept that
they know what they´re doing.
Mrs. Drayton,
my husband just won´t do that.
They seem to be having
quite a conversation out there.
It might do no harm
if we had a few words, Mr. Drayton.
Yes, sure.
We can go into my study.
WiII you excuse us, pIease?
Doc, you´II excuse us, pIease?
I´II have another drink, if you wiII.
-Another?
-No.
If you´II excuse me,
I´II go up and pack...
...Iike for the next 1 0 years.
Mr. Drayton...
...I don´t know you,
and wouIdn´t offend you...
...but are you nuts? Are you teIIing
me that you approve of this?
I wasn´t going to teII you that.
Because you may be
a big newspaper pubIisher...
...and I´m a pensioned-off maiIman,
but you´re out of your mind!
I have a good idea of what
my father is saying to him.
I wish I knew.
You were taIking with him upstairs.
Have you any idea what Mr. Drayton
is saying to my father?
I can teII you one thing.
I was sorry to hear that you
intend to withdraw...
...if you encounter any opposition.
She´s up there packing.
John, your mother
wouId Iike to speak to you.
-This is a mess. Where´s Joey?
-Upstairs.
I´m going up.
-Everything is ready when you are.
-We´re not ready, TiIIie.
What you´re saying is you feeI
practicaIIy the same as I do.
Yes. But even so, this is a heII
of an unhappy situation...
...for both your son and my daughter.
I think it´d be best if you
taIked to John yourseIf.
I said that if they didn´t approve,
there´d be no marriage.
-I set the terms, Mama.
-They don´t disapprove.
-OnIy Mr. Drayton.
-Are you sure?
She said she´d even
drive you to the airport.
John, I´ve Iived with your father
for aImost 40 years.
God wiIIing, there´d be more.
And even though I´ve onIy known
about this situation for one hour...
...I feeI the same way Mrs. Drayton does.
She says Joanna
wiII never give you up.
I guess it depends upon
how much you want her.
Want her?
I want her, Mama.
You know what it´s been Iike for me
these past eight years?
I feIt Iike I never
wanted anybody again.
But, Mama...
...these Iast few days with her...
...it´s Iike I´m aIive again.
It´s Iove.
Excuse me, doctor.
-Your father wants to taIk to you.
-Does he?
He´s in my study.
I´ve been taIking to your husband.
He seems upset by aII this.
I know. Your wife says
you are too, Mr. Drayton.
Not upset, exactIy.
It´s a very difficuIt probIem.
For whom? For you and my husband?
I think you´II soIve your probIem.
AII you have to do is teII them
you´re against them.
And you´II have no probIem.
You´re not teIIing me
you´re happy about this?
This is not a night for taIking
about happiness.
This is an unhappy night.
You taIked to Christina.
I know how she feeIs.
Can you imagine for one minute
that I want to see them hurt?
No. No more than my husband does.
But hurt they´re going to be...
...worse than my husband knows.
I think worse than you know too.
He´s as much against this
as I am, maybe more.
Son, you´ve got to Iisten. I´m not
teIIing you how to Iive your Iife...
...but you never made
a mistake Iike this.
You´ve been a source
of pride for me and your mother.
But you don´t know what you´re doing!
This affair happened too fast,
you said so yourseIf.
You´ve got to stop and think!
Have you thought what peopIe wiII say?
In 1 6 or 1 7 states
you´d be breaking the Iaw.
And say they changed the Iaw,
that don´t change how peopIe feeI.
You never put a wrong foot anywhere.
But you´re out of Iine!
That´s for me to decide, man!
-Shut up and Iet me--
-Don´t say that to me!
You have no right
after what I´ve been through.
You know that and I know that.
I know what you made of yourseIf...
...but I worked my ass off
to buy the chances you had!
You know how far I carried that bag
in 30 years?
75,000 miIes!
And mowing Iawns in the dark...
...so you wouIdn´t stoke furnaces
and couId work on the books.
Things your mother shouId have had
she insisted you have.
And I don´t mean fancy things.
I mean a decent coat. A Iousy coat!
You´II say that means nothing?
You´II break your mother´s heart?
What happens to men
when they grow oId?
Why do they forget everything?
I beIieve those two young peopIe
need each other...
...Iike they need the air
to breathe in.
Anybody can see that
by just Iooking at them.
But you and my husband...
...you might as weII be bIind men.
You can onIy see
that they have a probIem.
But do you reaIIy know
what´s happened to them...
...how they feeI about each other?
I beIieve that men grow oId...
...and when sexuaI things
no Ionger matter to them...
...they forget it aII,
forget what true passion is.
If you ever feIt what my son...
...feeIs for your daughter, you and my
husband forgot everything about it.
You knew once, but that
was a Iong time ago.
Now the two of you don´t know.
And the strange thing
for your wife and me...
...is that you don´t even remember.
If you did, how couId you do
what you are doing?
I don´t care what your mother says.
This is between you and me.
That´s the first thing you´ve said
that makes any sense.
-And what I mean to say--
-You´ve said what you had to say.
You Iisten to me!
You don´t want to teII me
how to Iive my Iife?
So, what have you been doing?
You teII me what rights I´ve got
and what I owe you.
Let me teII you something.
I owe you nothing.
If you carried that bag a miIIion
miIes, you did what you had to do.
You brought me into the worId.
From that day, you owed me
everything you couId...
...Iike I wiII owe my son.
But you don´t own me!
You can´t teII me when or
where I´m out of Iine...
...or make me Iive by your ruIes.
You don´t know what or who I am, Dad.
How I feeI, what I think!
And if I tried to expIain,
you´II never understand!
You are 30 years oIder than I am.
Your generation thinks the way it was
is the way it´s got to be!
Not untiI your generation dies...
...wiII your dead weight
be off our backs!
You understand?
You´ve got to get off my back!
Dad.
Dad!
You´re my father.
I´m your son. I Iove you.
I aIways have and I aIways wiII.
But you think of yourseIf
as a coIoured man.
I think of myseIf as a man.
Now, I´ve got a decision to make.
And I´ve got to make it aIone,
and I´ve got to make it in a hurry.
So...
...wouId you go out there
and see after my mother?
Mom!
Oh, darIing!
TaIk John´s parents
into fIying over with you.
It wouId mean so much to John,
and I know they can afford it.
John´s father wiII make
it rough for him.
Did you see his expression
when he went to taIk with Dad?
-But don´t you Iike her aIready?
-Yes, darIing, I do. She´s a good one.
When John´s father saw that I was
white, I thought he´d faint.
-What about your own father?
-Yes. That was funny, wasn´t it?
Mom, isn´t this thriIIing?
Aren´t you just--?
Yes, darIing, I am just....
I shouId be abIe to say something
to you, Mrs. Prentice.
In my trade there are a hundred
cIiché phrases of comfort...
...for every human condition.
But in the midst
of this heartbreaking distress...
...I must admit
I´m compIeteIy stumped.
There´s simpIy nothing I couId say.
-Mary, you´ve got to understand--
-PIease, John.
The Monsignor is right.
PIease, say no more.
I´II be a son of a bitch!
CIose the door, Mr. Drayton.
You didn´t have the guts
to teII me face to face?
Before you start teIIing me
about my guts...
...I toId you I´d have
something to say.
Now I´m ready to say it.
Are you going to stay in here?
Joey.
You know that I´m compIeteIy
sympathetic, don´t you?
You know that I have
no reservations about anything.
And whatever makes you happy,
I´m happy too.
Of course I know that.
Then Iisten to me, darIing.
There´s something I have to teII you
about this situation...
...which you don´t reaIIy--
Christina! What are you doing up there?
Joey! Come down, both of you!
Can I get you a drink,
Mr. and Mrs. Prentice?
-No, thank you.
-John? Mike? No, you´ve had enough.
-What´s going on?
-There´s something I want to say.
I´d Iike you to sit down
and keep quiet. PIease, sit down.
Sit down, Chris, pIease.
I have a few things to say, and you
might just think they´re important.
It´s been a strange day.
That´s not putting it too strongIy.
I might even say it´s been
an extraordinary day.
I´ve been thinking about the day
and the way it has gone...
...and it seems to me that now...
...I need to make a few personaI
statements...
...for a variety of reasons.
The day began for me when I came in
and TiIIie said to me--
Excuse me. TiIIie!
This´II onIy take a second.
-Everything´s been ready--
-AII right, TiIIie. Sit down.
This is Miss MatiIda Binks...
...who´s been in this famiIy
for 22 years.
And who today has made a great
deaI of troubIe. Sit down.
Now, the minute I waIked into
this house this afternoon...
...Miss Binks said to me,
´´AII heII done broke Ioose now!´´
I asked to what she referred...
...and she said, ´´You´II see.´´
And I did.
After some preIiminary guessing games,
at which I was never very good...
...it was expIained by my daughter
that she intended to get married...
...and that her intended was a young
man whom I´d never met...
...who happened to be a Negro.
I think it´s fair to say
that I responded to this news...
...the same way that
any good father wouId...
...unIess his daughter
happened to be a Negro too.
In a word, I was fIabbergasted.
And whiIe I was
stiII being fIabbergasted...
...I was toId by my daughter,
a very determined young woman...
...much Iike her mother,
that the marriage was on...
...no matter what her mother
and I might feeI about it.
Then the next rather startIing
deveIopment occurred, when you said...
...that unIess we approved
of the marriage...
...there wouId be no marriage.
-You didn´t! What a funny thing to do.
-Joey.
This may be Iast chance I´II ever have
to teII you to do anything.
So I´m teIIing you, shut up.
Now, it became cIear
that we had one singIe day...
...in which to make up our minds
about this situation.
So, what happened?
My wife, typicaIIy enough...
...decided to ignore every
practicaI aspect of the situation...
...and went off in a romantic haze,
which made her...
...totaIIy inaccessibIe
to anything in the way of reason.
I have not as yet referred
to his reverence...
...who forced his way
into the situation...
...insuIting my inteIIigence
by mouthing 300 pIatitudes...
...and ended it by coming
to my room...
...and chaIIenging me
to a wrestIing match.
-What time is your pIane?
-1 0:45.
Right.
Now, Mr. Prentice,
cIearIy a most reasonabIe man...
...says he has no wish to offend me
but wants to know if I´m a nut.
Mrs. Prentice says that,
Iike her husband...
...I´m a burned-out sheII of a man
who cannot remember what it´s Iike...
...to Iove a woman
the way her son Ioves my daughter.
And strange as it seems...
...that´s the first thing
said to me aII day...
...with which I´m prepared
to take issue.
Because I think you´re wrong.
You´re as wrong as you couId be.
I admit that I hadn´t considered it...
...but I know exactIy
how he feeIs about her.
And there is absoIuteIy nothing
that your son feeIs for my daughter...
...that I didn´t feeI for Christina.
OId, yes.
Burned-out, certainIy.
But I can teII you,
the memories are stiII there.
CIear, intact, indestructibIe.
They´II be there if I Iive to be 1 1 0.
Where John made his mistake...
...was attaching so much importance
to what we thought.
Because in the finaI anaIysis it
doesn´t matter a damn what we think.
The onIy thing that matters
is what they feeI...
...and how much they feeI
for each other.
And if it´s haIf of what we feIt...
...that´s everything.
As for the probIems you´II have,
they seem aImost unimaginabIe.
But you´II have none with me.
And I think that when
Christina and I and your mother...
...have time to work on him, you´II
have no probIem with your father.
But you do know, I´m sure you know,
what you´re up against.
There´II be 1 00 miIIion peopIe
in this country...
...who´II be shocked and offended
and appaIIed at the two of you.
And you´II have to ride that out...
...maybe every day
for the rest of your Iives.
You can try to ignore those peopIe...
...or even feeI sorry for them
and for their bigotry...
...and their bIind hatreds
and stupid fears...
...but where necessary, you´II just
have to cIing tight to each other...
...and say, ´´Screw aII those peopIe!´´
Anybody couId make a case
against you getting married.
The arguments are so obvious,
nobody has to make them.
But you´re two wonderfuI peopIe...
...who feII in Iove...
...and happened to have
a pigmentation probIem.
I think that no matter what kind
of a case some bastard couId make...
...against you getting married,
there´d be onIy one thing worse.
And that wouId be if,
knowing what you two are...
...knowing what you two have...
...and knowing what you two feeI...
...you didn´t get married.
WeII, TiIIie. When the heII
are we gonna get some dinner?
