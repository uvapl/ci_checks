# When somebody loves you #
# It's no good unless
he loves you #

# Happy to be near you #
# When you need someone
to cheer you #
...# All the way #
...Ow.
# Taller than
the tallest tree is #
# That's how
it's got to feel #
# Deeper than
the deep blue sea is #
# That's how deep it goes #
# If it's real #
# When somebody needs you #
Hey, man,
you said I could stay!
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did. You said
I could stay awhile!
No, I didn't.
Now take your fuckin' shit
and get your ass
out of here...
bitch.
Fuck!
Wait a minute, man.
Wait a minute!
I want my TV!
You're not gettin' my TV,
man!
I want my TV!
...Do you really want your TV?
...Yeah!
Catch.
Fuckin' sue you now.
Fucker!
Fucker!
Ugh!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Ugh!
Hey, Sinta, um...
It's your sister.
Bitch.
Hey.
Tony, I really need you.
Is that Mommy?
...It's not Mommy.
...Sounded like her.
It's not! Now go
eat your breakfast!
Come here.
Are you high?
...No.
...Yeah, bullshit.
Tony, you got to let me
stay here a couple days.
I don't got anywhere to go.
I'm not gonna let you keep
pulling these kids like that.
It is bullshit.
If you can't stay away
from here,
I'm gonna get a restraining
order like the lady said.
At least you can let me
stay in the garage again.
I don't got anywhere to go.
You'll probably be in jail again
soon, anyway, won't ya?
Tony...
Tony, I don't got
anywhere to go, man.
Man,
you're my only family.
I'm fuckin' hungry, okay?!
What am I supposed to eat?!
I don't got
anywhere else to go!
Please!
Just go wait over there,
will ya?
You're not gonna give her
money, are ya?
Hey!
Get over here!
Here. Take this.
It's 15 bucks.
This is the last time.
Don't you ever,
ever come here again.
You understand me?
How are they?
Mikey tied his shoe for
the first time two days ago.
Can't you give me $20?
Ruth?
Ruth, wake up.
She looks like the Tin Man
from "The Wizard of Oz."
Ruth!
Wh...?
Ugh. Ugh.
Hey, no!
Noooo!
Ugh.
Oh, God.
Oh, not on the hood.
Ugh.
Still huffin' that stuff
pretty good, aren't you, Ruth?
Oh, thanks.
You know you're pregnant?
Ugh.
Are you thinkin'
about havin' this child?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
.. Through informants
and investigation
that you are involved in
the manufacturing of the dope.
Whoever told you
that's a liar.
That's gonna have to be
determined by the courts.
Pregnant? Jesus Christ.
Pregnant? Jesus Christ.
She probably doesn't even know
who the father is.
Hell, I'll drive her
by the pound
on the way downtown
and get her spayed.
Do you know how many
times you've been arrested
for hazardous vapor inhalation
in the last year and a half,
Miss Stoops?
Uh... five?
...13... 14... 15...
16 times.
Do you know how many times
we've given you
substance-abuse treatment
in the state hospital
instead of jail?
Uh... three?
Uh, no, no.
Five, five.
Six... six times.
The record also shows
that over the years,
the state has stripped you
of four children,
declaring you, in all cases,
an unfit mother.
Unh-unh, unh-unh.
I was only unfit
for, uh, two of 'em.
First one got adopted,
and I think the second one...
Shut up. Tell me something,
Miss Stoops.
Did you know you were pregnant
at the time of your arrest?
I don't know.
What do you mean
you don't know?
Is there any way...
you can begin to understand
the depth
of your irresponsibility
toward your children,
toward the state,
not to mention
toward yourself?!
You sicken me.
I'm sorry.
So-o-rry.
Sorry.
You pleaded guilty... again
and waived your right
to an attorney.
Mr. Barnhardt here,
with the D.A. 's office,
wants to file
an amended complaint.
And I'm going to allow it,
charging you with
felony criminal endangerment
of your fetus.
Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Now, I'm not sure
if I'm setting a precedent
here,
but you've forced me into it.
I'm going to recommend
you be bound over
for a hearing
in Superior Court.
Wilda...
let me talk to her
for a second.
Come here, Ruth.
Look, Ruth...
You and I both know you didn't
plan on having another kid,
and you're not capable
of raising it.
So why don't you just do us
all a favor and go...
take care of this problem?
Do you understand
what I'm talking about?
Talking about me
getting rid of my baby?
Is that what you want?
What I'm saying is,
if you think
that you want to...
go to the doctor
while you're in jail...
you can go.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
And then, maybe...
maybe I can talk
to the city attorney
about reducing
those charges.
Next on the left.
Ugh!
Please help me, God.
Oh, God!
Oh, God, help me.
Oh, God, please, help me.

Let's pray.
Lord Jesus, we know that

Bless all

Amen.
Honey, what's wrong?
20... 40... 60... 80...

...Oh, darn.
Ooh. No, um.
...I got it.
...No, no, I got it.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Thanks, Diane.
$400.
Okay.
Sign here.
It's an awful lot
of money, Gail.
Honey, we'll get it back.
Ruth...
Wow, I can't believe that.
Nobody's ever paid
my bail before.
I'm Norm Stoney.
Ruth, when we met you
and heard about your case,
I just knew we had to help.
I feel like I won the lottery.
Might sound crazy,
but there are still
some pretty decent people
in the worid.
Mommy, Mommy!
Oh, there's
my little miracle!
How was jail?
Well, I met a new friend.
Meet Ruth Stoops.
We just want you
to stay here, you know,
as long as you need to,
to sort things out.
What's ours is yours.
Thanks, 'cause I'm kind of,
you know,
between places right now.
Well, you know what they say...
"Su casa es mi casa. "
...Oh, uh, Ruth...
...No.
We don't really sit
in those chairs.
Oh.
Um, you know what?
Why don't, uh,
you come back here,
and I'll show you
where to freshen up,
and then after dinner,
we'll... we'll...
we'll get you all set up
in the guest room, okay?
Uh, you do like steak,
don't you?
Mommy, do we still have
to wait for that lady?
I'm really hungry.
Yes, young man.
She's our guest.
Gail, this meat is done.
I'm trying to keep it warm,
but you're gonna be eatin'
shoe leather here.
Been in there
over an hour.
An hour and a half,
for cryin' out loud.
This is probably the first warm,
cozy place she's been in.
...Gail!
...She's been out on the street.
I mean, my God.
You have got to be careful with
the people you drag in here.
You don't know anything
about this woman.
You don't know
where she's been.
You don't know what kind
of life she leads.
...It takes a long time...
...Think of Matthew for once!
Think how long it takes me
to get ready.
I mean,
she's just getting cleaned.
Mom, can I at least have
a little snack?
That does it.
Is everything all right
in there?
Ruth...
I'm sorry.
I, uh, uh...
Dinner's ready.
How do I look?
Clean and pretty.
Wow,
I feel like a princess.
Who's wearing
all that perfume?
You mind your manners,
young man.
...Cheryl?
...What?
Aren't you gonna welcome
your mother back?
Hi, Mom.
Honey, you're just
in time for dinner.
Grab a plate.
I'm not hungry.
Well, we have a guest,
and we'd like you
to join us for dinner.
Cheryl, get out here.
Honey, I'd like
for you to meet Ruth Stoops.
She's going to be staying
with us for a while.
You pregnant?
How'd you know that?
Ruth, um...
will you join us in grace?
Everyone, arms up to Jesus.
Lord, we thank you
for reuniting our family
around this table,
and for the miracle
of meeting Ruth.
...Amen.
We recognize
that it was your divine hand
that brought us all together.
Oh, yes, Lord.
Ruth is in a very troubled time
in her life right now.
And we know that through us,
you can show her
the right path.
As with open minds
and open hearts,
we can all share and learn
from one another's experience.
So, I go, "Raul, I hate you!
I hate you, man!
"I hate you! I trusted you,
and you let me down!
You let me down, man,
just like all the others!"
Ruth, Ruth, let's...
let's calm down, okay?
He freaks out.
He screams,
"You want to see blood?"
Right in my face, "I'll show
you blood, you fucking bitch!"
...Ruth.
...Ruth.
Ruth.
And this is my model plane.
It's my first model.
And those
are all my other models.
This is Noah's ark,
and you can kind of put,
like, that lion and Noah
and the monkey on the roof
with the pig
and the giraffe.
And then,
this is what I like to do...
you pick them up,
and you go...
Oh, Ruth, there you are.
Matthew... bedtime.
Say good night
to our houseguest.
...Good night.
...Night.
He's my little miracle.
You know, after I gave birth
to Cheryl, I almost died.
The doctor told me I couldn't
have any more children.
Oh, then God gave me
Matthew.
Wow.
Can I watch TV, or...
We don't have a TV.
Ruth, I want you to get
a good night's sleep, now.
Ruth, I want you to get
a good night's sleep, now.
Tomorrow, you can tell me
all about your case.
We're gonna help you
fight this one.
Gail and I feel
very, very strongly
about this.
Yeah, I never had
a felony before.
I don't want to go
back to jail again,
at least not for more
than a week or two.
Don't you worry.
We've dealt with
this Judge Richter before,
but this time,
he's gone too far.
When I think about
what he said to you...
Norm, honey, you're not
boring Ruth to tears, are you?
She's dead on her feet!
No, no.
We're just getting to know
each other.
Well, you know...
this was
my old bachelor bed.
Ahh!
That's
an old, familiar sound.
...Mmm.
I sure am beat.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.
You know...
I was... quite a sinner
before I married Gail.
Hey, I have this alarm set
for 7:30,
um, so you'll have
plenty of time to get ready,
'cause first thing
in the morning,
we're gonna go
right over to the clinic.
They're real
professionals there,
and I think everything's
gonna turn out just fine.
I've been so lucky
to meet you.
Nobody's been so good to me
for such a long time.
You're such a nice family,
and your home is so nice.
You're safe here.
You're safe, honey.
I'm gonna get my life
together this time.
If I could just stop
the huffing and everything,
I'd be okay.
I know I would.
I know you would, too,
Ruth.
Well, it's been an emotional day
for all of us.
Yes.
But we're together now
in an atmosphere
of Christ's love.
Praise Him.
Oh, give me your hands.
# Joyful #
# Joyful, joyful, joyful #
# Praise be to God #
# Thankful, thankful #
# Thankful, thankful #
# Blessed is His name #
Thank you, thank you.
Pretty.
Good night, Ruth.
Good night.
...Oh, fucker!
Hey, it's me... Cheryl.
Go back to sleep.
...What do you want?
...Nothing.
I'm just on my way out
through the garage, okay?
Don't narc on me.
Oh, where are you going?
Just out... to a party.
Party?
Mom tell you about Matthew?
Yeah.
What did she say?
She said he was a miracle.
Ah.
...Mmm.
...Mmm.
Cheryl!
Cheryl,
get over here, quick!
Come on, hurry up!
What?
Come on, get over here!
Jesus, what happened?!
l- I don't know.
She... She found
a can of touch-up paint.
Oh, fuck!
Ruth, are you okay?
My parents
are gonna kill me.
Well, I don't know what kind
of stuff you used,
but it didn't work
'cause it was wet.
It's... It's all leaking.
Well, honey,
they've got some new caulking
down at the store.
I'm gonna bring it home,
and we're gonna
seal that puppy up.
Well, here she is.
Well, hello there,
little Miss Sleepyhead.
I bet that's
the first good night's sleep
you've had
in a long time.
Yeah, but we wouldn't
want to miss our appointment.
Anybody got a cigarette?
No, there's no smoking
in this house.
Here are your eggs...
hot, hot, hot.
Uh. Uh.
Now, you eat up.
And I'll just run
and put my face on.
Mmm.
Say, Ruth...
I got a call
early this morning
from a, uh, a reporter
down at
the "Journal American."
It seems like
that case of yours
might, uh, turn out to be
pretty important around here.
He wanted to chat with you,
of course,
but... I told him
that you were resting,
and that
we weren't quite prepared
to make a statement
at this time, anyway.
Is that okay with you?
Ruth?
Good.
Now, I want you...
to have a wonderful day.
You know, I don't feel good.
I don't want to do this.
Oh, Ruth,
I know it's scary,
but you have to be brave.
You're in the best
of hands here.
Now, before you know it,
you'll just be
right as rain.
Come on.
Congratulations.
Your test confirms that you,
in fact, have a baby on the way.
How about that?
Well, I need to find out
about getting an abortion.
Well, that's...
I think you're just
very upset right now,
and you don't understand
all the facts.
I want you to talk to me
about whatever is troubling you.
I mean,
that's what I'm here for...
I'm here to listen.
Okay.
Like I said,
I need to get an abortion.
Let me just ask you
something, Ruth.
Have you ever
really taken the time
to think about what it means
to have an abortion?
Yeah.
Um, it means that
I don't have to go to jail,
and it means I don't have
to have another baby,
and it means that I can start
getting my life together.
I, I, I, I, I...
Don't you think that's all
just a little selfish?
Isn't there someone else here
you need to consider,
someone who's living
inside you right now,
just waiting to be born?
I think this would be
a good time
to have Dr. Rollins step in
and just explain
some of the medical facts
to you, hmm?
Charlie...
Huh? What?
Oh, what? Oh!
Yes, yes.
Dr. Rollins,
this is Ruth Stoops.
She's about
8 weeks pregnant.
And she wants to know
more about her child.
Oh, fine, fine.
Ruth...
Yes.
Here, let me show you
something.
Ruth, your baby is already
well into its journey
in life.
At 10 weeks, the baby
is just about this size.
The head and the feet and
the hands are all fully formed.
Your baby has a heartbeat.
And you know something,
Ruth?
Some studies have even
shown brain activity.
Now, isn't that remarkable,
that even
at such an early stage,
your baby is made
in God's image?
Here.
I want you to hold it.
Yes.
Wow. It's got a little thing.
Well, of course it does.
That's because
it's a little boy baby.
Now,
when you have your baby,
what would you like to have?
Would you like to have
a little boy or a little girl?
What do you...
What do you mean?
Well,
we're just talking here.
Let's say you decided
to have the child.
Uh, would you like it to be
a little boy like this one?
Maybe a girl.
A girl.
Yes, and what are we gonna
name this little pumpkin?
Are we gonna call it,
uh, uh, Mary or...
or Sally
or Susie or, uh...
Tanya.
Tanya!
...Baby Tanya.
But I can't have
a baby right now.
I don't want another baby.
Man, you don't understand.
I'm in a really bad,
bad situation right now...
I mean bad.
We know it's hard, Ruth,
very hard.
But you have to face
reality.
If you feel as though
you can't raise Tanya,
we can put you onto
an excellent adoption agency.
What's the matter?!
Are you fuckin' people deaf?!
I said I want an abortion!
Ruth, uh, do you like
to go to the movies?
We have a movie
we'd like to show you.
Do you want to see
the movie?
...Abortion is murder.
These scenes
of actual aborted fetuses
stand as grim testament
to the American Holocaust.
Like Auschwitz and Dachau,
the abortion mills of America
wage genocide against the...
Oh, how'd it go?
We had a good talk,
sorted everything out,
and I think everything's
gonna be fine.
Just fine. Right, Ruth?
I slept in some dumpsters.
Maybe I slept
on some babies.
Looks like we need
a little cheering up.
Manager to the front counter.
Bingo.
Manager to the front counter.
Here you go.
Now, if you have
any trouble with these,
you bring them right back.
Norm...
Mmm.
Look who's here.
Well, well. Visiting me
down in the salt mines, eh?
Hey, you know what?
I'm glad you came.
I've got something
I want to show Ruth.
Ohh.
Oh, shit!
I hate that picture!
Oh, now,
it's a fine picture.
Why do they care about me?
I didn't do nothin'!
Now, Ruth, I'm afraid,
whether you like it or not,
this article
is just the beginning.
A lot more reporters
have been calling,
even from the TV stations.
Some are so antsy,
that one of them tracked me down
right here to the store.
Now, pretty soon,
we're gonna have to decide
what to tell them.
Well, tell them...
I don't know what to tell them.
Norm...
are these your fliers?
Oh, did I leave those
up front again?
Thanks.
This is the last time,
Stoney.
I'm warning you.
And you know what?
Dale's out today.
You collect carts!
Might be those reporters.
I better take care of this.
...Hi, how ya doin'?
We were wondering if
we could talk to Ruth Stoops.
...Oh, no. I'm sorry.
...She's here, isn't she?
Well, I'm sorry.
We're having dinner right now.
...Is she here, though?
...Uh, no.
We don't need to bother you,
we just want to talk to her.
...It's them.
...Just let her talk to us.
...Ruth! Are you...
...Just let us kind of talk...
...There she is!
...Ruth! Ruth Stoops!
Ruth Stoops! Ruth!
...Wow.
...Who was that?
...Ruth! Ruth, open up!
Oh, just a couple of loonies
comin' out of the woodwork
when we're having dinner here.
Why can't these people mind
their own business?
...Ruth!
...Ruth!
Oh, no, that's it!
That's it! That's the limit!
...Get off my property!
...Go home!
...Get out of here!
We're gonna call
the police right...
We are calling
the police right now!
My husband is in there
calling the police!
You better get off of this
property, and I'm not kidding!
Someone is in there calling
the police! If you don't...
Get out of the way, Gail!
Get out of the way!
You people get off
my property right now! Move!
That got 'em.
That got 'em.
Man, are those people
crazy or somethin'?
Yeah, that's exactly right...
they are crazy.
But you're safe here.
Well, let's, uh...
Let's finish eating.
Pretty soon,
we're gonna have to decide
what we're gonna tell them.
Congratulations.
Your test confirms you, in fact,
have a baby on the way.
How about that?
Is there any way
you can begin to understand
the depth
of your irresponsibility?
Your baby is already
well into its journey
in life.
So why don't you
just do us all a favor
and take care
of the problem?
And you know what?
Dale's out today.
You collect carts!

Baby killer!
Baby killer!
Murderer!
Dirty murderer!
...Murderer!
...All right, people, get back!
We know where you live!
...Do you hear me?!
Why did he jump
on that car?
Back up. Come on, Kirk.
You did your job.
...Baby killer!
...Kirk's just very passionate.
He saw a lot of killing
in Vietnam
and won't tolerate any more.
...Get back, get back!
You people know the routine...
either keep movin', or get
back across the street!
...You're a paid assassin!
...Come on, people.
Hope you saved me
a honey-glazed.
...Right there.
...Ah!
Ruth,
I think it's so wonderful.
Gail's been going on and on
about how you're gonna give up
drugs and have your baby.
She did?
Ruth, look!
Kathleen and Sandy from jail,
remember?
Is it true?
Oh, uh,
we're very proud of her.
She's really turning
her life around.
Mm-hmm.
And we're gonna take care
of that legal... Car!
...Hey, look!
...Car!
...There's a car!
Come on, Ruth!
Come on, honey!
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
...Stop the car!
...Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Here's my phone number!
I'll take care of the baby!
...sucking right
out of your womb!
Take my phone number,
I'll take a hike!
Here's my phone number!
If you think you don't
want your child alive,
you'll be much more haunted
by its being dead!
Why should
the size of your baby
be the only criteria
for loving it?!
Don't do it!
Don't kill your baby!
We can help you!
All right, everybody, you
did your job, now get back.
Get back, back behind
the injunction line.
I'm talking about
a federal law, pal.
Now get back.
You know the routine.
Get back!
I know
exactly how these giris feel.
Years ago,
I had an abortion
in this place.
It destroyed me.
I think
about my dead baby all the time.
If these women knew
what they were doing,
they wouldn't do it.
No, it's just
a business to them.
400 or 500 bucks a pop.
It's like contract killing.
Ruth Stoops. Hi, I'm
Cindy Lindstrom, Action News 4.
You're a hard person
to get ahold of.
I have a couple of questions
about your case.
No, I don't want people
knowing my business.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Now, now, wait a minute, now.
Ruth does not wish to speak
to the press right now.
This is a very personal,
very private matter
for Ruth and for us.
Excuse me, Norm, but I think
she can speak for herself.
Hey, I said I don't want
people knowin' my business!
I told you!
Fucker!
You see?
Now we got people upset.
Ruth?
Honey,
what did she say to you?
Can we go now?
We got about an hour
and a half left.
I don't feel too good.
I got a really bad headache.
Oh. Why don't you sit down
somewhere?
I'll get you
something to drink.
My stomach hurts.
I wish I could take a dump.
I'm really constipated.
Let's go, uh,
have you sit in the car.
Okay? Would that
make you feel better?
Now, be sure
and crack the window
if you get overheated.
Y- You sure
you're gonna be all right?
Aw. Fuck!

You will see how
at no risk to you
and with absolutely
no money down
you can own your own home.
It's only fear that holds
people back in life
and keeps them from achieving
financial independence.
If you just have a little
confidence in yourself
and allow the Larry Jarvik
system to work for you,
I guarantee
you'll be equipped
to take control
of your own economic destiny
in ways you've never dreamed
possible.
Ruth...
Come on, Ruth.
We're all looking for you.
What are you doing?
That looks like
my model glue.
...Is that my model glue?
You're not supposed
to smell it like that.
Get out of here, kid!
Mom! Dad!
Hey, shut up!
Over here! Mom!
Dad!
I said shut up,
you little fucker!
Matthew! Honey!
Are you okay?
...What happened?
...What's going on here?
I found her smelling
my model glue, and she hit me.
You hit him?
What is wrong with you?!
Where is this glue?
Where is it?
Give me that!
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
In the name of God,
I want you to get off drugs
right now!
This is the devil.
Do you hear me?
You have got the devil
inside you!
Please don't hit me.
You are full of sin
and disease!
We let you in our house!
We reach down
and lift you out of that
filthy cesspool you live in,
and this is
how you repay us?!
I'm such a bad person.
We're all sinners!
But that doesn't mean you
can go around smelling drugs,
especially when an innocent
baby suffers for it!
I do not want that woman
back in my house again.
W- What are we gonna do...
put her out in the street?
Do you know how long
that will last?
I don't care.
Put her in a halfway house.
She wouldn't last 5 minutes
in a halfway house!
Listen, you two,
all this burden
doesn't have to fall
on your shoulders.
Let me take Ruth
for a while.
Diane, no.
No, really.
You don't know what you're
getting yourself into.
I worked with substance abusers
back in Wyoming.
Maybe I can control her.
I know.
Are you sure about this,
Diane?
Oh, yeah.
We'll be fine.
Okay, Ruth. Come on.
You're coming home
with me today.
That's right.
Come on. Up.
Don't forget! Ruth has a
counseling sessión tomorrow!
Hey! Hey, you!
Hey! Hey, you!
Uh, Ruth.
Ruth, I think there's someone
trying to say hello.
Yeah, you!
I'm gonna kill your fuckin' ass,
you bitch!
Suck the shit out of my ass,
you fucker!
Hey, fuck you!
No, fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
No! Go, go, go, go!
Go!
Oh, my.
Who was that?
I don't know.
Some guy.
We're here.
Uh, Ruth...
this might be a little
confusing at first,
but there's something
you need to know.
I'm not exactly
who I appear to be.
The truth is...
I'm not a "Baby Saver."
I work for pro-choice.
You see, Ruth,
there's a war on,
and I guess you could
call me a spy.
This is Rachel.
She lives here with me.
Ruth!
Ruth.
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.
Hey, hey, hey.
...Come here.
...Ow!
Ruth.
Ruth, Ruth.
...Ruth.
...It's okay.
Don't be afraid, Ruth.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We're your friends.
We're on your side.
Ow! Ow!
Ohh! Ohh! Mngh!
Ow! Ow. Uh-uh.
Feel that?
Uh, yeah.
That feels good.
That's your liver.
You have to realize they want to
use you to attack Judge Richter
for saying he'd let you out
for an abortion.
He's been ruling against
the "Baby Savers" for years.
And now with all the
publicity you're getting,
they want to use you
to send a message.
If they keep you from getting
the abortion you want,
it'll be a big symbolic
victory for them.
Hey...
do my spleen again.
But... thanks to Diane's work,
you're safe from them now.
It is always women like you
who are most victimized
by anti-choice...
indigent women, third-worid
women, women of color.
I'm not a colored woman.
Yesterday we reported the
tragic story of Ruth Stoops,
an indigent woman charged
with criminally endangering
the life of her fetus
because of her drug use.
Members of an anti-abortion
group, the "Baby Savers,"
have paid her bail
and taken her in
while she awaits hearing.
And today, they brought her
along to their daily protest.
Action News 4's Cindy Lindstrom
was there.
As anti-abortion protesting
continued today
outside the Women's
Health Services Clinic,
Ruth Stoops showed up
alongside "Baby Savers" local
chairman Norm Stoney.
Stoops declined to speak
with us on camera today,
but Stoney tells us she does
not plan to have an abortion.
He thinks her unusual case
could set a precedent.
We're amazed that the state
can seek to punish someone
for endangering
their preborn baby
and then allow them to kill it
through abortion.
Now, we hope, and Ruth hopes,
that the absurdity of this case
will make crystal clear
the fundamental
unconstitutionality of abortion.
This simple woman,
this quiet voice will send
a deafening message that
abortion must be stopped.
Oh, man! I never said
anything like all that.
He knew I didn't want anybody
knowing about me.
Stoney said Stoops' number-one
priority right now
is to get off drugs
and alcohol.
Cindy Lindstrom,
Action News 4.
That's probably Gail.
...deadly explosión at a
chemical plant in Sioux City.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Gail.
I sure did.
Where'd you see it?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I kno... I know.
I'm sure it'll send
a great message.
Channel 7, too? Whoo!
We...
Oh, sh... she's doing fine.
Just fine.
No problems at all.
Well, you know something?
Actually, she just stepped
into the shower.
No, I didn't!
Oh, my goodness.
Here she is now.
...Ruth, it's Gail.
...I know.
You're okay with this?
Yeah. Give me that.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, I saw it.
Let me tell you somethin'.
You want to send a message?
I ain't no fuckin' telegram,
bitch!
Shh.
Nothing's wrong!
I'm fine now.
You think I'm a fool. You're
the fool 'cause guess what!
This is a war,
and Diane's a spy!
...How 'bout that?
...Uh.
Now you're catching on.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're a cunt!
How'd I do?
I guess we better get
Harlan out here.
Ohh!
Harlan here.
What?
What?!
Right.
It's them.
Quicker than I thought.
Fasten your seat belts,
everybody.
Good luck, Harlan.
Evening, folks.
What's the occasión?
Cut the horse manure,
Harlan, you Nazi,
and turn out that light.
Where is Diane?
She's sleeping. Why?
She is not. Diane!
Now, I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep your voice down.
You're gonna wake
everybody up.
Ruth! Honey, we're here!
Are you all right?
Ruth! Ruth!
Hey, come on, kids. I don't want
to have to call the police.
We already did.
Ye serpents!
Ye generation of vipers!
How can you escape
the damnation of Hell?
Whew, doggies.
Matthew 23:33.
That's very impressive,
Norman.
Evening, Harlan.
Folks.
Officers, they're holding a
woman captive inside this house.
Is that true, Harlan?
She's in there, Jim.
She's no captive.
You want to have her come out,
Harlan?
Diane, you want to go ahead
and bring Ruth out?
Diane?
Surprise.
What kind of person are you?
All this time we've been
like sisters.
Sisters?
You don't know what it means
to be a sister.
People, let's get to the point
so we can all go home.
Ruth, have these people
kidnapped you?
No.
Are you here
against your will?
No.
They've brainwashed her!
They've got her all doped up!
Ma'am...
I know this woman.
She's about as sober
as I've ever seen her.
Officer, the point is
that woman belongs with us.
We're responsible for her.
We paid her bail.
Yeah. A-And I bought her
those shoes.
Well, it looks to me like you're
just responsible for her bail.
Okay, folks,
let's all just go home.
There's nothing going
on here.
Ruth. Ruth, please. Honey,
please come back home, okay?
I forgive you
for this afternoon
and for everything that you
said to me on the phone.
Please! Your bed is waiting
for you.
And Matthew misses you.
We share a special bond.
We're like a family, remember?
Don't let these...
these lunatics sway you.
For the love of God,
don't believe their lies.
Look at Diane.
Look how she lied to us.
Had us completely fooled.
She's lying to you, too.
She's lying!
So what's it gonna be,
Ruth?
Uh...
I'm gonna...
stay here.
And I'm gonna have that abortion
like I wanted.
'Cause I'm a citizen
and I got my rights
to, um, pick
and y-you're just trying to...
And, um, I'm a woman...
and my body belongs to me.
Right?
Right.
Your body belongs to God!
Norm, please don't do this.
Please, please don't pull
one of your stunts.
Let's just all go home.
# We are the soldiers
of Christ... #
If you don't all leave
right now,
we're gonna have to start
making arrests!
Back in your cars now!
Non co-op!
#... and our breastplates
are strong #
# With the blood
of the lamb #
# We will right
Satan's wrong #
# We are the soldiers
of Christ... #
Yeah,
this is Bundy and Iverson.
Looks like we're gonna need
some backup out here.
That's all right, Officer.
Never mind. We'll go.
Thanks, Norm.
We really appreciate it.
All right, people, let's go!
#... with the blood
of the lamb #
Let's leave this...
this death camp.
But mark my words, Diane,
Harlan,
and the rest of you murderers,
this isn't over.
Come on. Let's go!
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on.
Get in your cars.
Good work.
So when can I get
that abortion anyway?
Thursday
would be the soonest.
We'll make
all the arrangements.
Well, does it cost
a lot of money,
'cause l-I don't got
any money.
Don't worry, Ruth.
I'm sure we can find a way
to take care of it.
How would that be?
Whatever.
Oh, my God!
Come here.
You got to see this.
Ruth, you don't want
to miss this.
Oh!
Look at that moon.
She's right down here
with us
as if to say
everything will be all right.
# Moon mother #
# Hear us now, feel us now #
# Earth mother #
# Hear us now, feel us now #
# Goddess mother #
# Mother of us all #
# Hear us now, feel us now #
# We are one #
# We are one #
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just fine.
You're safe here with us.
Yeah.
And those lights over there
sure are pretty.
...Mmm.
...Mmm.
Oh, shit!
...A vigil.
...# Hmm #
Come on. Let's go.
Ah, they're going inside.
Now what?
Well, give me a second.
I can't see through walls.
Got 'em. They're in a room
on the second floor.
Must be some sort
of indoctrination room.
Damn it!
So, I think there's
everything you need.
Let... Let me know if
there's anything else, okay?
This is the bathroom...
sort of a combination closet
and bathroom, as you can see.
By the way, you're welcome
to any of these things.
I think they'd probably
all fit you.
Oh, that's pretty.
...What, this one?
...Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah. Rachel and I brought
a lot of this stuff
back from Guatemala
a couple years ago.
Here. Try it on.
That's okay.
No. See how it looks on.
I'll wear it tomorrow.
Okay.
Sleep well.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Ugh!
God!
Fuck!
Ugh!
Well?
Oh, yes!
We did it!
Hey, Harlan.
Good morning, Ruth.
Whatcha doin'?
Just a little insurance.
You never know.
Hey, who are those?
Uh, they're just some friends
of mine that wanted to help out.
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stay away from those windows.
Look, kid, why don't you
just go in the kitchen
and get yourself
a cup of coffee, huh?
Man.
...Good morning, Ruth.
...Morning!
...Did you sleep okay?
...What's going on?
Oh, we're just making
a few preparations
for your trip to the clinic.
Uh, let me introduce you
to a few very good people.
Peter...
Hi, Ruth.
Briana...
...Hey.
...And Fran.
Hi. Remember us?
From the window
the other day.
...Tryin' to get you out.
...Got it.
Shit!
Fuck!
The "Baby Savers" are declaring
a national alert.
A national alert?!
And Jessica Weiss herself
might declare a counter alert
and fly in personally.
Jessica Weiss here?
She's coming here?
What?
What? What?
I thought you said
everything's okay.
It is.
Everything is okay.
It's... It's just
a little different now.
This might be hard
to understand,
but you're at the center
of something really big now.
It's not just about you
anymore.
It's more about the choice
of millions of American women.
Oh! What'd I do now?!
Nothing. Nothing.
You didn't do anything.
Don't worry. We're gonna make
sure you have your appointment
without any interference.
There may be
a few more people around,
and they may be yelling
some ugly things,
but don't let that bother you.
Ruth, we love you!
Don't kill the baby!
Ruth, don't do it!
Save the baby!
Ruth!
Save the baby, Ruth!
Save the baby!
Ruth! Please, Ruth!
Ruth, please!
Save Tanya! Ruth!
Don't kill Tanya!
Listen, please don't kill
the baby!
Get her away
from those windows!
He's gonna try to kill me!
I gotta get out of here!
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you.
The safest place for you right
now is right here in this house.
Harlan has everything
under control.
Don't kill the baby!
Please!
Ruth! Save the baby!
You can't show weakness now.
You've got to prove to them
that you're not gonna give
in to their pressure.
We're gonna have to get her
a special appointment tomorrow.
Okay.
Let's get a call in to Sarah.
It's ABC News. They want
an interview with Ruth.
Ruth is not giving
any interviews!
This is a private matter!
Whoo! We're here!
We're here!
Frank, you old son of a gun.
I haven't seen you
since Buffalo.
We took the kids to Florida,
and then we stopped
in Virginia
to see the tomb
of the unborn baby.
Yeah, this is unit 27.
We're still
the only ones on scene.
We're gonna need
some additional units out here.
Then there was that time
in Wichita.
We were making the gridlock,
you know.
And Lloyd had to take a piss
so bad,
he started turnin' blue.
That's all right. I've got an
extra battery pack right here.
Right now there's sign painting
in the Garden Room.
The press conference
is in the Heritage Room.
...What?
...Oh, here comes Norm now.
Hey, Norm, you sure got
a big one on your hands.
All in a day's work.
Just doin' what the Lord asks.
God bless you, Norm.
So, we support Ruth, but we
oppose the pro-abortion forces
that are seeking to use her
as a symbol by coercing her
into doing something that she
clearly doesn't want to do...
butcher her unborn baby.
Uh, excuse me, Norm,
but recent national alerts
by the "Baby Savers"
have not drawn anything
like the numbers they used to.
Now, we know you had
a big disappointment in Akron.
Realistically, how many people
do you think will show up here?
There has been
a tremendous outpouring
of Christian love and support.
So much so that concerned people
from all across this nation,
including Blaine Gibbons,
our national chairman,
are committed to Ruth.
So we're... we're expecting
many, many people.
Thousands...
in the next few days.
But we have something else
very exciting to announce.
But we have something else
very exciting to announce.
And for that, I'm going to turn
the microphone over
to Dr. Charlie Rollins,
the director of our Tendercare
Pregnancy Center.
Thank you, Norm.
Well, I am very proud to be able
to say that an anonymous donor
hearing of Ruth Stoops' plight
was moved to reach out
in a very special way.
I am holding here a check
for $ 15,000 made out
in the name of Ruth Stoops
to be presented to her
upon the birth of her child.
$ 15,000!
The "Baby Savers" also said
three different couples
have volunteered
to adopt Ruth Stoops' baby.
Meanwhile, anti-abortion
protestors continue to arrive
outside this house
where Ruth Stoops is staying.
The house belongs
to Diane Zeigler,
an abortion-rights activist.
So the question
on everyone's mind is
"What will Ruth Stoops do?"
Only she knows, and for now,
she's not talking.
Don Mattox, Eyewitness News.
What the hell do you think
you're doin'?
I'm rich! Didn't you hear?
I gotta go talk to Norm.
I gotta get that check.
No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.
Ruth, listen to me.
Listen to me.
You've got to be very strong.
You've made your decisión,
and you've got to stick to it.
Wait.
It's my body, right?
It's my choice, right?
Can't I change my mind, huh?
Can't I?
Yes, of cour... of course
you can change your mind.
That's what this is all about.
Just make sure you're doing it
for the right reasons.
$ 15,000 might sound like
a lot of money,
but there are more important
things to consider.
Like what?
Come on, Ruth.
Do you think you're ready
to have a child?
Hey, I have four other kids,
and I didn't make a cent.
Besides, they said they got
people to adopt.
And can you stay off
drugs and alcohol
for the next 7 or 8 months?
Don't forget. You're facing
very serious charges.
You may be forced to spend
your entire pregnancy in jail.
Maybe longer.
I can give up drugs if I want.
God damn it!
How come every time
I want to do something
somebody tries to keep me
from doing it?!
Why can't I ever do
what I want?!
Somebody's shouting.
Wa-a-a-nt!
It's okay.
How can I turn down
so much money?
...Shh.
...I can't.
All my life
I never had a chance.
If I had money,
my life would be different.
I would have been
such a good mother.
I have nothing to live for.
That's not true.
And, Ruth, don't forget.
If you reject
the "Baby Savers"' offer,
you'll send a strong message
that a woman's choice
can't be bought.
Send a message?
What?
What did I say?
You want me to send
a message?
No. No.
Wait a minute, Ruth.
Hold on! Ho-o-o-ld on!
Hold on, lady!
You don't want me
to change my mind
'cause it's real important
to you!
But what about me?!
I don't got anything!
You all got everything!
What are you gonna do
for me, huh?!
Are you gonna give me
$ 15,000?!
Sure.
I'll give you $ 15,000.
You will?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on here.
...Yep.
...Harlan!
You're not fuckin'
with me, man, are you?
'Cause if you're
fuckin' with me...
I never fuck with anyone.
Look, I got
my Agent Orange settlement.
And if I can level the playing
field for you, I will.
I won't let their fascist money
be a factor in your decisión.
So I'm gonna give you
$ 15,000, Ruth,
and you can do
whatever it is you want to do.
Stop this, both of you,
right now.
Does that mean if I have
the baby, I could have $30,000?
Okay.
Wait... Wait a minute.
Now, let me rephrase this.
$ 15,000 from them
if you have the kid,
and $ 15,000 from me
if you don't.
Now you can choose freely
again.
Harlan!
You can't do this!
I just did.
Blaine... here.
Let me help you.
Blaine...
I can't tell you
how much it means to me
that you declared the alert
and came so quickly.
No, Norman.
I'm grateful to you.
When you told me
what was going on over here,
I was outraged.
More outraged than I've been
in a long time.
And there's a lot of things
in this country that outrage me.
Hello, Gail!
Oh, God bless you, Blaine.
Come on.
The car's over here.
If this gets out, it'll do
irreparable damage to us.
You know
how it'll be perceived?
Like we're paying her
to have an abortion.
The "Baby Savers"
will have a field day.
Look, giris, this has got
nothing to do with anybody
except Ruth and me.
You know, I've been providing
security at the clinic
for a long time,
free of charge,
because I believe
in personal freedom.
And because I believe
in personal freedom,
I'm gonna do what I want.
I'm acting
as an individual here.
Okay. So you're promising
that Women's Health Services
and pro-choice have absolutely
nothing to do with this?
Because we'll deny we ever...
Don't get your panties
in a wad, okay?
Who do you think
you're dealing with here?
I was in the Special Forces!
That's why the FHA
makes home ownership possible
for low-income people
in the first place.
Take out a pencil and paper.
Good. Now, make a column
down the left-hand side
listing all your assets.
Ruth!
Ruth!
We need to talk to you.
Hey, do you have
a pen and paper?
'Cause I need a pen
and paper.
Yeah. Could you step in here
for a minute, please?
I need a pen and paper.
The thing is, Ruth,
about this, uh, deal
between you and Harlan...
you know,
w- we've been talking, and, um,
w- we just want to make sure
that you understand.
They don't want you to tell
anybody where you got the money.
...Okay.
...This is very important.
You can't tell anyone ever.
...Because if you do...
...I won't.
Thank you, Ruth.
We really appreciate it.
Now can I have
that pen and paper?
Eric?
You want to get me
some ice?
Sure, Blaine.
You're a great kid.
Did I ever tell you
about Eric?
Yeah.
His mother was standing
on the steps
of the abortuary
about to go in
and kill her baby.
And she heard a Christian voice,
and that voice said,
"You don't have to go
in there.
"God loves you.
God loves your baby."
So she stopped, with tears
in her eyes, and she said,
"I'm an unmarried woman.
"I cannot afford the expenses
of having a child.
"No one cared enough
"to give me the strength
to accept this baby.
No one but this one
Christian man."
And that Christian man...
was me.
Ha ha ha!
Years later, at a rally,
I saw the young lady again.
And I said to her,
"What's
this young man's name?"
And she said,
"This is Eric."
And that was the proudest day
of my life.
Hey, Harlan.
Hey.
Thanks for that money.
No problem.
Are you married, Harlan?
No, but I got a couple
of ex's on the payroll.
You got a girlfriend?
What?
Are you comin' on to me?
Because if you're coming
on to me,
you can just forget it.
I'm not comin' on to you.
I just wanted
to thank you.
Well, I don't need
your gratitude, okay?
As a matter of fact,
I hate gratitude.
Fine.
Tell me somethin', Ruth.
What are you gonna do
with all that money?
I know a way to get a house.
...A house?
...Mm-hmm.
With the rest of the money,
I'm gonna buy a car.
And, uh... set myself up
in a business.
Or go to California.
I never saw the ocean.
Ruth, I don't want to burst
your bubble,
but you and I both know
that money'd be gone
in three days tops.
Fuck you, man!
You don't know anything!
What's the matter, Ruth?
Can't you take
a little tough love?
Fuck you, loser.
Why don't you tell me
about this... $ 15,000?
We just thought...
well, you know
how the pro-abortionists
are always accusing us
of only caring about the baby
while it's in the womb?
Mm-hmm. Go on.
Well,
we wanted to show them
that we're committed
to the child after birth, too.
Ruth, uh, well, you know,
she can barely support herself,
let alone a baby.
And we didn't want money
to be a factor in her decisión.
Well, what a nice thought.
Of course,
it would have been better
had you passed it
by me first.
That's enough.
Have you got any idea
how far $ 15,000 goes today?
Our fax bills just for a month
are over $2,000.
Has it ever crossed
your mind,
have you ever thought
about the fact... thank you...
that maybe some people
might think
this is some cheap attempt
to buy this girl...
that we are trying
to bribe her?!
A few of us pledged
all that we could
to raise that $ 15,000.
And we all agreed not to have
the picnic this year.
We might seem like small-town,
unsophisticated people to you,
but we've got our pride.
I know.
Maybe I am
a little too passionate,
but that's who I am.
That's why I founded
this ministry.
That's why I lead
this ministry.
I lead it with every pore
and every fiber
and every muscle
in my being.
And if we really want to
demonstrate our compassión
and our commitment
to saving lives...
then maybe we should offer
this girl at least $30,000.
Government foreclosures,
bank foreclosures,
Government foreclosures,
bank foreclosures,
and estates in probate
to name just a few.
This is the end of tape one,
side two
of the Larry Jarvik system.
To continue, go to tape two,
side one now.
Shit!
Baby Tanya
doesn't have a voice, Ruth!
Only us!
Abortion is murder!
Mngh! Mngh!
Mngh!
Yeah?
I'm Carol Stoops.
I'm, uh, here to talk
to my sister Ruth.
Sorry, lady.
Can't do it.
But Ruth's my sister.
Just tell her I'm here.
Just remember,
it's a child, not a toy!
And give her this note.
It'll prove to her who we are.
I'll see what I can do.
Now, move the vehicle
off the property.
We'll park and come back.
Hey, Harlan!
There's a woman here
that says she's Ruth's mom.
If you're gonna crack
an egg to make over-easys or...
Some of those jugheads
have been online...
at the box office
for two days.
Hey, Blaine.
Excuse me.
...Hey! Hey!
...Hey! Hey!
Hello. Good afternoon.
...God bless you.
I'm Stan.
God bless you.
...God bless you, sir.
...Pleasure.
...I appreciate all your time.
...God bless you.
...Nice to meet you.
...Thank you, thank you.
Hi, Blaine.
...Thank you.
...You're welcome.
...Oh, looky here.
Oh.
Come on.
...Mr. Gibbons?
...Yes, sir.
...Mr. Gibbons?
...God bless you, sir.
We have a few questions
for you.
You are, uh,
network affiliated, right?
It's Action News at 5:00
with Tom Daley
and Barbara Spade,
Harv Kent at the sports desk
and Skip Kirschner
with weather.
Now, Ruth,
if you can hear me,
and I hope you can,
we are with you.
We've been praying for you
both day and night.
Earlier today, a generous donor
offered to help you financially
so that money would not play
a part in your decisión.
People all over the country
have been moved by your plight
in the same way,
and their pledges
are pouring in.
The phones have been ringing
off the hook.
...You're offering money?
...That's what I'm saying.
The fund for Ruth and her baby
now stands at nearly $27,000.
...$27,000...
Fuck!
...donated by Americans
who will not stand by
and watch a baby die needlessly
because her mother is poor.
Whoo!
...$27,000!
Harlan!
Ugh!
Harlan!
I gotta go talk to Harlan.
I gotta go talk to Harlan.
Ruth...
No. Harlan!
Harlan! Harlan!
...Get her in the chair.
...Let me talk to him.
...Get her down.
...Ow! Ow! Ow!
Where'd you get this bottle?
Nowhere. I found it.
Yeah, like maybe in the liquor
cabinet in the kitchen?
You know you're not
supposed to be drinking.
What... for my baby?
You don't give a fuck
about my baby.
You want me to kill my baby!
But they want me
to have my baby,
and they're gonna give me
$27,000 for it.
I'm gonna go talk
to Harlan!
...Shut up! Enough!
...Harlan!
You listen to me,
and you listen good.
I have spent nine months
in a secret life
among people I hated,
and I've blown all that work
on you.
We have been up
for 36 hours
making all the arrangements,
trying to make everything
as easy as possible for you,
and this is how you repay us.
Fuck off!
I don't care!
My body belongs to me!
And if you don't let me talk
to Harlan,
I'm gonna go have my baby
right now!
I want to go talk to Harlan.
Sleep it off.
Eat me, dyke.
Uhh-uh.

How you doin' today?
I don't feel too good.
I feel kind of strange.
I'm sorry I lost my temper
last night.
So, what do you think?
You still considering
their offer?
Okay.
Okay, then.
Okay, well, listen,
whenever you're ready,
come on downstairs, okay?
Diane?
Yeah?
There's somethin' important
I want to tell you.
This morning
when I woke up...
Diane, do you read me?
Yeah, Harlan.
What's up? Over.
She's coming in.
Have Ruth stand by.
Oh, boy.
Uh, yeah.
It's earlier than expected, but
there was nothing I could do.
We got to get her out of here
right away.
Uh, so, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
Oh, uh, I just wanted to know
about that money.
Did Harlan tell you where
he was gonna leave that money?
That's between you and him.
Where did he say it would be?
At the clinic
on the bottom-right shelf
behind the front desk
in a black bag.
Then that's where it'll be.
It's Jessica Weiss.
Just like old times.
Green light, ladies.
Here we go.
There they go!
Ruth, no!
...Hello.
...Hello.
...Hello.
...You must be Ruth.
I'm very pleased
to meet you.
You're a very brave
and special woman.
What?!
Ruth!
Ruth, honey, don't do it!
Mom?
Ruthie, honey, don't do it!
I seen you on TV,
and I came right away!
...Ruth, you listen to me!
Don't you do it!
What if I'd aborted you?
At least I wouldn't have had
to suck your boyfriend's cock!
Don't you bring that up again!
That's ancient history!
I've been saved.
Fuck you!
Ruthie, don't you do it.
...Take the money!
...Fuck you!
Ruthie!
Tanya's on the move!
Move it!
Move it, move it, move it!
Come on,
let's get to that clinic!
Hurry! We'll stop them
at the clinic!
Come on, now!
Yeah?
10 minutes, everybody.
They're at the airport.
Oh, we're going in this?
Wow!
This is all wrong.
No, we are not going
in this.
This is sending entirely
the wrong message.
Do you have any idea
how many strings I had to pull
to get the only bulletproof
vehicle in the state?
Come on, you guys,
let's go!
What are they doing?
Well,
they've got to turn...
Norman, move it!
...Move it, move it!
...I...
...Move...
Move it!
M- Move! Turn!
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
Move! Let's go.
Jessica Weiss,
it's an honor to have you.
I'm Sarah Schneider.
Oh, Sarah,
we've spoken before.
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.
...Well, Dr. Cary Milton.
...How do you do, Doctor?
...So pleased to meet you.
...Oh, you must be Ruth Stoops?
...Mm-hmm.
Ruth, I'm gonna ask you
to go fill out some papers
and have a blood test,
and then you'll meet
with another woman and myself
for counseling, okay?
You'll be fine, just fine.
You'll be all right.
Y- Yeah.
Where's the bag?
Ruth, don't start this.
I'm not giving fuckin' blood
without that bag.
...God, it's great.
...We loved it.
We read it from one cover
to the other and back again.
...You got a bag for me?
...Well, thank you.
I had a great deal of help
with the research on it.
...There you go.
...That's it.
Oh, I'd be happy to.
Oh, well, thank you.
Pull 'em in.
Line 'em up.
Line 'em up.
Okay,
in the last seven months,
have you visited any
of the following countries...
Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Bhutan, Burkina Faso?
Excuse me, um,
where's the bathroom?
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
Come on, man.

This is tape two, side one
of the Larry Jarvik system.
Welcome back.
We've discussed the difference
between liquid assets,
frozen assets,
and what I like to call
captive assets.
And by now, you've filled in
the chart on page 113.
Keep the chart handy while we
figure the capitalization rate
on your investment.
You'll see how simple it is
to turn short-term paper
into long-term,
interest-free income.
I'll walk you
through one example,
and you can go back and do
the calculations again,
substituting your own numbers.
Say you're buying a fourplex
with an asking price
of $ 150,000,
and your net operating-income
figure is $9,000.
Divide the operating income
into the asking price
and what do you get?
That's right... 6%.
Now, do your own calculations,
and when we continue,
I'll finish talking
about asset conversión.
Remember to bear in mind
rule two
of my Seven Golden Rules
for Success.
Shit!
