APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
Tonight on 8 Out Of 10 Cats does
Countdown,
Jon Richardson,
Joe Wilkinson,
Chris Addison,
Katherine Ryan,
David O'Doherty,
Susie Dent and Rachel Riley.
Now, welcome your host -
Jimmy Carr!
Hello and welcome to 8 Out Of 10
Cats does Countdown,
a show about letters,
numbers and conundrums.
Did you know, for example,
hypothermia is a state in
which the core temperature of the
body falls below 35 degrees?
People who died from it include
mountaineers,
and during a cold snap,
viewers of regular Countdown.
A Victorian slang term for
a vagina was a crinkum-crankum.
I find it fascinating.
I love looking up things like that.
And to obnunciate is to
announce bad news,
as used in the sentence,
the shopkeeper obnunciated,
&quot;I'm sorry, Rachel, but we only
&quot;have that particular dress in a
child size.&quot;
Saves on VAT, you'd know all
about that, Jimmy. Saves on VAT!
CHEERING
Right, let's get started.
OK, let's meet tonight's players,
first up it's Jon Richardson.
CHEERING
Jon recently became a father.
Jon's got OCD so the conception took
a while as as soon as he turned
his wife on, he had to go back and
make sure she turned her off again.
And Jon's team-mate, Chris Addison.
I'm not saying Chris Addison
has weirdly long limbs, but I'm not
sure whether to laugh at him or
trap him under a glass and put
him outside.
Up against them this evening is
special guest team captain
Joe Wilkinson.
Joe lives in Brighton.
He fits right in because if there's
one thing the residents of
Brighton love, it's a hairy bum.
Joining Joe tonight is
Katherine Ryan.
Wow!
Katherine Ryan is Canadian.
If you don't know much about Canada,
just imagine America is Waitrose
then Canada is
a really boring country just to
the north of Waitrose.
Katherine,
you often tweet about celebrities.
If you could go on holiday with any
celebrity, who would it be?
Oh, my gosh! I'd probably go on
holiday with you. Good choice.
W-Why me?
I mean, I think you're super
fun and I know you live
a lavish lifestyle and like,
I think you need a best friend.
MUTTERING
And we have...
LAUGHTER
You know I'm a real boy?
I could watch you be mean to people.
I would love that...
We'd stay in the best hotels and
no-one would ever rob us,
Kardashian style.
You're turning into Sean Connery.
Bit of advice, don't go on holiday
with Richard and Judy. What happens?
What happened?
All they do is read books and screw.
JIMMY LAUGHS
Joe, how do you unwind at the end of
a hard day?
Ohhhh....how do I unwind...?
What I like to do, is I like to run
a hot bath.
Put some bubbles in it.
Sprinkle some petals in there.
Pour myself a nice glass of wine and
I slide in the bath and I
wait for whosever house I've just
broken into.
APPLAUSE
Jon, here's a question for you.
Hello.
What's currently on your to-do list?
I'm currently heading up an
investigation into why men
have stopped wearing socks.
At what point somebody decided it
was fine, but it really isn't fine.
The fungicide.
I got bullied for having half-mast
trousers at school.
I wore them deliberately to show off
a quite splendid sock range.
Those kids now... You had trousers
that were too short for YOU?
Chris, in The Thick Of It you did
quite a lot of creative swearing.
Yes. Do you do any of that in real
life? Have you got any good...?
Fuck, yes.
Do you swear at inanimate objects?
Yeah. I called the chair a fuckwad.
Nobody else was around. There was
nobody that I was addressing...
I stubbed my toe and called it
a fuckwad.
I've called my cat
a little arsehole before now.
That's when you know it's
slightly out of control.
How do you get around to...?
You've got kids? Yeah.
Do you swear in front of them
or do you use creative?
I try to avoid swearing in front of
them because I don't want
them to guess what the Wi-Fi
password is.
You've got to swear as much as you
can in front of your kids because
you're not cool to them and
therefore swearing isn't cool.
That's good. So I know that my
daughter is never going to swear
like,
bang a load of guys in the garden.
Or if she does, she won't call it
&quot;bang&quot;.
She'll say make love to
a load of guys in the garden.
And that's the kind of loser I want.
OK, Chris, have you got a mascot?
Yeah, I have. What did you bring?
I brought this crocheted
dissected rat.
GROANS AND LAUGHTER
Wow! My wife made
me it for my last birthday.
She said I've got exactly what you
want for your birthday.
She sat up at nights crocheting
me a dissected rat.
Are you sort of mid-divorce now?
We've been together about 18 years
so you run out of ideas after
about nine.
Most people go with like, bondage.
Those were years ten through 13, so
were through that.
What do you get her? What do I get
her? Yes.
I get her an Amazon voucher.
Between 25 and £50,
depending on how the year has been.
The worst thing about that's I can
just see Jon's little head
going, &quot;What a good idea!&quot;
Katherine, have you got a mascot?
I have a mascot. What's your mascot?
ODD ACCENT: I've been in show
business ten years now. Have you?
Yeah.
Where are all these accents coming
from this evening?
Ten years in show business.
So I wear shoulder pads,
that's number one.
2-nil on shoulder pads, isn't it?
Yeah, I wear them as well.
How many years have you been
in show business?
I don't think you can call what
Joe does show business.
What actually happened is the man
that died in that suit...
..had shoulder pads for
reasons of his own.
To be fair,
he put up a hell of a fight.
LAUGHTER
So my mascot,
after ten years in show business,
I feel like it's time for
me to start being an asshole.
Or at least having a
celebrity quirk.
Because like, Christian Bale goes
against superstitions.
He'll purposely pour out road salt,
I read, walk under ladders.
You've got to be quirky.
Then there's you and all your
stuff and so...
I've decided that I should start
believing in and collecting
crystals with metaphysical
properties so this is a good one.
This is an amethyst, I think, and it
gives you more creative energy.
You bury it in the garden so that
it's powered by the Earth and
you dig it up and just like...
Try it, Joe.
Then these ones...
I really believe in this!
I carry them when I fly,
I'm just like...
You can fly, that's fucking
amazing.
Yeah. This one supports,
it's for unconditional love,
that's what I have for you.
Also faith in you as a leader.
Thank you.
This one is just like for purity
and this is the sea,
I don't know why,
just so you can swim better.
So I brought them here today
to help us win.
Are you getting enough sleep?
No! OK.
Jon, have you got a mascot?
Yes, I have, Jimmy.
This week I've brought a mascot
that I hope to monetise. Oh!
This isn't just my mascot, it's now
the official Countdown mascot
because to my knowledge you
don't have one.
So this is now the official
Countdown mascot. This is Clocky.
APPLAUSE
It's got a fall-back story, Clocky.
Born in the '60s, so not into drugs
himself, but his parents did a lot.
As a result, not really looked after
but managed to get himself to
a university and went to Clocksford.
GROANING
Then Countdown happened in 1983 and
suddenly everybody wanted
a 30-second clock. Now you can take
Clocky around with you.
If you buy your own Clocky,
it's got a little pad here,
this is the clocksucker.
LAUGHTER
You can attach Clocky to whatever
you like and he's just good
for any point you
want 30 seconds to go by.
So if someone rings and you don't
want to talk to them,
you just start Clocky and...
COUNTDOWN CLOCK STARTS
That noise on the phone gives
a certain sort of pressure to
whoever you're talking to.
Yeah, I've got about 30 seconds,
bang!
COUNTDOWN JINGLE
Bye!
What else do you use it for, Jon?
You can do 30-second workouts.
30-second workouts?
That's quite a big thing now,
what do they call it?
High-intensity, HIT training. They
say do 20 minutes, I say 30 seconds.
Can we see 30 seconds of training?
You do like 30 seconds of push-ups,
something like that, so...
What would you do? I do 30 seconds
of push-ups, I do that every day.
Yeah, go on.
I just don't think I need to.
I just think it's so clear.
You can do 30 seconds of step ups.
I think we'd want to see 30
seconds of push-ups?
CHEERING
Oh!
Careful.
I think you've just broken that.
I think it may be a design flaw.
SQUEAKING
Sorry, did you just blow...? I
just blew in the clocksucker!
I fucked it!
Come on, Jon,
we're looking forward to this.
Ah... I don't know why I even got
into this position.
Ready? Yeah.
You start and I'll press. You press
and I'll start.
Worth a go! You can do it, Jon.
CLOCK TICKS
Go ahead.
JON GROANS
That's one!
LAUGHTER
HIGH PITCHED VOICE: Keep going,
Jon, do it for Clocky!
Three!
Come on!
AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS
Five.
Six. Oh!
About 50, was it, I think?
OK. Joe, do you have a mascot?
Yeah, I do but it's
a little bit embarrassing, my one.
It's... I, basically, when I was
little, I had a doll.
I loved that doll, I took it
everywhere with
me so, basically, I brought
my doll along.
Got the doll as a kid.
This is the doll I had when
I was a toddler.
LAUGHTER AND APLAUSE
Erm... Her name is Tiffany.
Yeah, we went everywhere together.
Is that not a sex doll?
What's wrong with you? No.
You're a pervert, mate.
This is a kids' doll.
Right, Jon, hold that, right.
I don't really want to touch it.
LAUGHTER
She's just a little doll, mate.
You had that when you were a child?
Yeah, I got it as
a christening present.
Urgh!
What are you doing?
Holy hell!
Oh, it's squidgy! It's squidgy!
Feel it.
It's a lovely dolly.
EURGH! Oh! Whoa!
Basically, she's just
a normal doll that every kid had.
I'll prove it to you.
Look, this is us...
This is us at...
LAUGHTER
This is us at the funfair.
This is us... This is us
at football training.
I can't believe you think
it's a sex doll.
It's just a perfectly normal doll.
Who gave you the doll, Joe?
My uncle Terry. It's a...
It's a christening present.
He had a load in a van.
She can make a fist.
Yeah, she can, yeah.
It can go up your arse as well.
LAUGHTER
Come on, let's get you out of here.
APPLAUSE
OK, over in Dictionary Corner,
we've got David O'Doherty.
APPLAUSE
David has that
&quot;just got out of bed&quot; look,
if the bed was some
flattened cardboard boxes
in the doorway of a Currys Digital.
You look like Dracula's less
successful younger brother.
Count Down!
Wahey!
APPLAUSE
David, if you died today, what would
be your greatest achievement?
Erm... I mean,
a lot of people talk about it,
but I actually did the old popcorn
trick a few years ago.
What? In the cinema, the popcorn
and you have it on... your lap.
And you just, you know, you...
WHISTLES
With the...? Up through the...
I actually did...
I'm the one person
who actually did it.
Wow! The movie choice was wrong.
Philomena is...
LAUGHTER
It's an amazing film, but...
And the other problem is, I had
been led to believe
it would be instant hilarity,
but the two things that
I hadn't factored in were
one - is the size of
a contemporary cinema popcorn box.
So it was like
a giant wastepaper basket.
And secondly, how salted...
LAUGHTER AND GROANING
..the popcorn is.
I think I basically pickled it.
I think...
It's possible,
hundreds of years after I'm dead,
my wanger will still be
perfectly preserved.
People will think it was like
a Viking's purse
or something like that.
Susie, were you surprised when you
got to the bottom?
LAUGHTER
OK. And with David, of course,
it's Susie Dent.
APPLAUSE
In David's most recent book, he
named a squirrel after Susie Dent.
Small, wild and with an
insatiable appetite for nuts,
Susie was delighted.
I was really happy when he told me
I was a character in his book.
And then the squirrel bit came
and I thought, well, OK.
But apparently I'm a thief.
I'm a credit card thief.
Yeah, Susie...
Susie helps me with...
I write children's books and Susie
knows the correct way to spell
&quot;meow&quot; and words like that,
and then to thank her,
I made her into
a criminal squirrel in the new book.
Yeah, that's...
KATHERINE: Aw!
That's the time she met Joe.
OK, and in charge of the numbers,
it's Rachel Riley.
APPLAUSE
Rachel loves her food
and for a treat,
she often eat gluten-free,
organic, vegan cupcakes.
That's a coincidence, Rachel,
because sometimes as a treat,
I don't.
Rachel, what's your worst habit?
I guess food, like you said.
There's a lot of stuff I can't eat,
so sometimes it's just finding
whatever's in the cupboard
I can eat.
So the other day, I had just nachos
for starters and thought I'd do
a bit of cooking for main,
so I had... toast.
LAUGHTER
The worst one I ever made was
gluten-free pasta with Doritos dip.
Mmm(!) It was rank,
absolutely disgusting.
You bloody fool.
Joe, what's your worst habit?
Following people around, I suppose.
OK, the prize the teams will be
competing for tonight is this -
the Countdown metal detector.
BEEPING
APPLAUSE
BEEPING GETS FASTER
EXTREMELY FAST BEEPING
OK, let's Countdown, everyone.
Time for our first game.
Jon and Chris,
you get to pick the letters.
Please. Oh, can I? Brilliant!
Please can I have a vowel?
You can. Thank you, Chris.
South paw!
Two vowels. A.
Three consonants... O.
And four from anywhere else, please.
G, L
R
Erm... A consonant.
F
Vowel.
I
Oh, God. Erm... Consonant.
P
And vowel.
And...
E
And for the first time today,
here's the Countdown Clock.
BOTH: One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.
All right.
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.
Right, hang on. This is easy.
LAUGHTER
All right, erm...
Call it a draw?
Yeah, fuck you, lady.
Yay!
APPLAUSE
Chris, how many?
Seven.
Oh! Jon, how many?
Er, eight.
Oh, for fu... Huh?!
Joe, how many?
Five-ish.
Five-ish. And Katherine?
Six. Not seven or eight. OK.
Joe, your five?
LAGER.
LAUGHTER
Katherine, your six?
GOALIE. Yeah.
Ah, fuck...
Chris, your seven?
FRAGILE. Huge.
Jon, your eight?
It's another word for a
lady's night aid.
A FRIGPOLE.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Yes, a FRIGPOLE.
No FRIGPOLE.
Seven points to Chris.
APPLAUSE
Good, a good start.
All I've ever wanted!
It's a good start.
David, Susie,
could they have done any better?
We got a couple. And by &quot;we&quot;
I mean one of us more than the other
got a couple of other sevens.
PROFILE, PERGOLA. One eight, though.
LEAPFROG. Oh...
Yeah, sorry, guys. LEAPFROG.
So, at the end of that, Jon and
Chris are in the lead with seven.
APPLAUSE
Onto our first numbers round.
OK, Joe and Katherine,
you get to pick the numbers.
I don't know what's going on,
you do it.
You just have to decide
how many big numbers we want
and how many small we want.
Er...
OK. I feel sick when they do this.
I find this one really hard.
DAVID: Has anyone ever gotten no
biggies? Can you get all littlies?
Yeah. Is that...? I mean,
if you were just trying to ruin
them, that might be an option.
I'm... David, what the hell, man?
We've known each other for years!
Let's, let's, let's have 100,
because that's always easy. Yeah!
And then some little ones.
You can't actually pick THE numbers!
She's rubbing a crystal on his head.
Go with six small and press
the button. OK.
You manifest and say what
number you want it to be,
and I bet it will be it. 2...
OK, what's she going to say next?
4... Er, 4. And then?
Er, I mean... (1!) 1.
Yep!
What do you think next?
It's a small picture of a pony.
LAUGHTER
OK, Joe.
Go on, guess the target, then.
I'll guess the target, hold on.
7, 2 and 4.
Guess the target, come on.
723, bang on.
So close(!) 315. So close!
That was... That was freaky!
LAUGHTER
OK, and your time starts...
We haven't got big ones!
..now.
JON: You've fucked us here, mate.
KATHERINE: You can't do it!
How the hell...?
We need a big one!
LAUGHTER
Even a 25.
Oh, this is making me feel sick.
I just can't do that.
OK, that was a really bad idea.
LAUGHTER
So, the target was 315.
Joe, did you get it? I got four.
LAUGHTER
Could you talk us through
your working?
I just wrote four in the corner.
OK, so you wrote four.
Literally, the whole... Yeah.
What did you get, Katherine?
I got 280.
280, wow. That's excellent.
Chris, did you get it?
I got 230.
Whoo!
I'm smarter than Chris Addison.
OK, Jon, did you get it?
No, I didn't. But...
I sort of think...
Well, Jon, bear in mind...
I got a sum.
That's a good start!
But I just didn't get any
of the numbers in the sum.
I basically multiplied everything
together except the one,
which I added to try and...
I popped a four in the corner.
LAUGHTER
If you show that...
If you show that to Jimmy, he's not
going to say that's a four.
I'd like to point out,
Chris and Jon,
I've got the same amount
of points as you
and I just wrote a four
in the corner.
LAUGHTER
OK, Rachel, it was easy.
How did you do it?
It was impossible, actually. Yes!
HE CACKLES
you could have got some points,
but you couldn't have got 315.
OK, so the scores at the moment -
Joe and Katherine have no points.
Jon and Chris have seven.
APPLAUSE
And here is your teaser.
The words are A BELL END.
The clue is - you can have it,
but I'll need it back.
That's A BELL END.
You can have it,
but I'll need it back.
See you after the break.
APPLAUSE
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Welcome back.
The answer to the teaser.
the words were A BELLEND,
the clue was -
you can have it,
but I'll need it back.
It was of course LENDABLE.
OK, they've been
playing in teams so far
but this game is just for
Joe and Chris.
So, Joe, your turn to choose the
letters, Chris, your turn to win.
I'll have a consonant, please.
Thank you, Joe.
S
Ah, yeah, could be plural. Um...
LAUGHTER
I'll have a T, then,
could be, like, STOP.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Whenever you hold the crystal,
you look like Rasputin.
Let's put some of them in you, like
in your pockets. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't want to win THAT much.
Right, pop an O up.
Close, U.
All right, a P.
Oh, and now a P.
Oh, I've got to write them down.
Shite.
A consonant, please.
G
I need more of the other ones.
Vowels. Yep. Vowels.
O
And then I'll have another...
Yeah, go on, then,
I'll have a vowel.
I
Oh, an N. I mean, consonant.
S
OK, and your time starts now.
SWING MUSIC PLAYS
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
I'm just going to stretch this out.
I think I've done my hamstring.
Shit. Joe, what did you get?
How many?
Can you ask Chris first?
Chris, how many?
I got one more than Joe.
So, Joe, how many did you get?
Do you reckon that's a word?
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
I've got a five.
Yeah, Chris, what have you got?
I have actually got a five.
Yes! Whoa!
We're in it, we're in it.
Chris, what was your five?
SWIGS, or TWIGS.
Joe, your five? MOIST. Oh!
Oh, that's really good, isn't it?
I was going to go MOISTS, plural.
Cos he gets all the babes wet.
Yeah, yeah.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
Susie Dent, am I right in saying
that your least favourite
word in the English language
is MOIST?
Yes. Could it be plural?
Well, it can't be plural,
but these days you can put
an S on it as a verb.
Oh, shit the bed!
What does it mean, then, MOISTS?
She moists the...?
Ugh!
Do you like the word gusset?
Look! Look what you've done to
Dictionary Corner.
What about the word squelch?
It's all right.
I quite like squelch.
You like squelch.
Squelch is all right.
I think we've lost focus.
OK, five points to both teams.
APPLAUSE
Could they have done any better,
Dictionary Corner?
No, six is top, really.
OK, so, at the end of that,
Joe and Katherine have five points,
which they're very pleased about,
and Jon and Chris have 12.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Right...
Now time for Jon and Katherine
to go head-to-head.
Jon, your turn to pick the numbers.
Bung a big one up.
Trust me, it's quality and all.
Bung a big one up, please, Rachel.
Just the one?
And then what's the verb
for the small ones?
A couple of titchy ones.
A couple of titchy ones.
Couple of titchy ones.
And then go for your life, love.
And then go for your life, love.
All right, don't piss about,
put the little ones.
1 and 8.
And the target...
LAUGHTER
I could do that!
Shall we...? No, don't you dare!
OK, and your time starts now.
No, no, I don't know.
So, Katherine, did you get it?
No, I got 771. Oh, that's amazing.
Pretty good, though.
Jon, did you get it?
I got 769.
Ha-ha! Oh, that's the same.
LAUGHTER
Katherine, how did you get 771?
8 x 100 = 800
Yep. Lovely stuff.
7 x 4 = 28
+ 1 = 29
800 - 29 = 771
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Seven points to Katherine.
How did you get 769?
This is going to get very exciting
for Joe, because I actually got 779.
Oh! Ooh! Oh! Ooooh!
LAUGHTER
Seven points for Katherine.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Let's make a game of it.
It's the crystals, do you think?
Yeah, you put one up your bum,
magic happens.
If you believe in the universe,
you can make amazing things happen.
I mean, I believe in the universe...
Explain how we're winning.
Are we winning? No.
LAUGHTER
Rachel, 770 looked pretty easy
to me. Could it be done?
Yeah, there were a couple of ways.
Oh, of course there are. Sorry, Joe.
You could have said...
100 + 4 = 104
x 7 = 728
- 8 + 50 = 770
Yeah, yeah.
APPLAUSE
OK, so, Joe and Katherine have 12,
Jon and Chris also have 12.
It's all level.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
OK, time now to go over to
Dictionary Corner.
David O'Doherty, what have you got
for us? Well, I've got the...
I've got the party machine,
everyone,
and this is a song about
communication.
# My friend was in a restaurant
on a date
# And the date
was going really badly
# The guy was boring and stupid guy
he'd ever been on a date with
# He was wondering why
he'd gone on a date
# With such a boring and stupid guy
# Just then the boring and stupid
guy got up and went to the loo
# And my friend decided
to send a text message
# To another of our friends
# Outlining the ways in which
the guy was both boring and stupid
# And including in it some direct
quotes of things that he'd said
# That were boring and stupid
# But when the boring and stupid guy
came back from the loo
# He could barely talk and he had
obviously just been crying
# And my friend realised
that he'd sent a text
# To the person that text was about
# Yes, he'd sent a text
# To the person the text was about
# You can try and pretend
it was just a joke
# Ha-ha-ha-ha
# But you were just being rude
# In an over-the-top,
inappropriately jokey way
# But you can never be sure
if the person believes you
# So your relationship's
effectively ruined any way
# You can just be honest
and apologise
# But now they know what you
actually think about them
# The best thing you can do is just
delete their details from your phone
# And hope you never, ever, ever,
ever see them again
# A while ago I did this song
for the first time ever
# I was my way home on my bike
having tried out this song
# And I felt a text message
in my pocket
# So I pulled over my bike
to see who it was from
# And it was from a friend of mine
who'd been at the gig
# And the text message said
# That was the worst gig
I've ever seen him do
# He used to be funny but
he's really lost it lately
# Complete bullshit
# And even though he phoned up
a minute later
# And we had a good laugh about what
a hilarious prank he'd played
# I still can't be sure
# He didn't send the text
♪ To the person
the text was about. ♪
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
David O'Doherty, everyone.
And here is your teaser.
The words are SUCK PITS,
the clue is -
put your hands above your head.
That's SUCK PITS,
put your hands above your head.
See you after the break.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Welcome back. The answer to the
teaser, the words were SUCK PITS.
The clue was - put your hands above
your head.
It was, of course, STICK UPS.
Before we go on, a chance for our
teams to win some bonus points.
I've got a selection of objects,
all spelt with nine letters.
All they have to do is identify them
with their hands whilst
wearing a blindfold.
Whoever identifies the most objects
gets the points.
Jon and Joe, you're playing this,
so join me at the feeling station.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Put one in your pocket. This one.
Here you go. Thanks, mate.
Joe, you're just over the cover on
that little mark there. Sorry, mate.
LAUGHTER
Oh, it's going to be like that,
is it? OK.
So you're against the clock.
All you've got to do is identify
the nine-letter objects.
First person to guess correctly wins
the point. Your time starts... now.
KLAXON
First item, please.
Where the hell is it? It's going to
be in between the two of you.
OK, there it is. Ah! Oh!
Oh, hello. There you go.
Brassiere?
Brassiere is the right one.
Well done. Next one.
You've got to be quick.
OK, there you go. Be gentle,
be gentle, be gentle.
Oh, it's a dog.
Let me just check with Susie.
Is that a nine-letter word?
It isn't, it's three letters.
Sausage dog.
Is it a sausage dog? It is a sausage
dog, yeah. But what are they called?
A... Dach...
Dachshund. Dachshund.
Yes, that's right. Oh!
OK. Don't worry, that dog's gone.
Gone to live on a farm now.
OK, guys.
Well, kind of that way. In there.
There you go. Oh, Christ!
You have to go lower down,
lower down. Not there, lower.
Lower. Lower.
Lower. There you go. Oh,
er... stockings. Correct. Yes!
LAUGHTER
OK. Go lower, lower, lower.
There you go. Around there.
Lower, Joe. Joe, a bit lower.
What do you think that could be?
Cock and balls!
No, it's not a cock and balls, no.
Strap on?
Ho-ho-ho!
Sausage. It's a kind of sausage.
Frankfurter.
A small sausage is called a...
Chipolata!
Chipolata is the right answer, yeah.
OK.
He's... Come on, Joe.
Hey!
Let's see if...
if Joe recognises his own father.
Scientist? It's not a scientist.
Fisherman. Yeah!
Yes, correct answer.
KLAXON
What's happening. Hey!
LAUGHTER
JOE GIGGLES

Smashing stuff.
Chris?

THINKERS.
APPLAUSE

to get, an eight.

APPLAUSE
So at the end of that,
Jon and Chris are in the
lead with 25 points.
Time to go across to
Dictionary Corner once again.
David, what have you got for us?
Well, I've made a mistake in the
past of sometimes looking at
Twitter while the show is
on and there's
a lot of things that are said about
Dictionary Corner.
One of the criticisms is that,
Susie,
we don't like to party and that is
so wrong. Right here.
Going to give you... Susie,
what's the time?
It's party time. Correct.
# Cos there's a partially starting
right now
# You are all invited
Party starting right now
# Time to get excited
# As if the neighbours who live on
this side have gone away and the
# Neighbours that live on this side
are old and pretty much deaf
# Party, party, party, party, party!
# There's gonna be lots of ladies
and men at our parties
# With some cheese in the kitchen
Babybels
# There will be streamers flying
through the air
# Someone will probably go home
wearing someone else's coat
# It's going to be fucking mayhem!
# Call all of your friends and
invite them along
# But not friends of friends
That would be too many friends
# And this party is some basic
ground rules
# You don't want a situation
like at Rob's party last year
# Where a CD went missing
# Someone broke a chair
# And someone tried to fill
Rob's dog with helium
# Tried to stick him up onto
the ceilium
# But he didn't float up
or bark high-pitched
# He just became violently ill
Party, party, party, party, party!
# Someone's drinking beer from
a shoe with a crazy straw, ow!
# When the party starts to rock
# Don't use the downstairs loo
because it gets blocked
# Whoo! We're gonna party all
through till the break of dawn
# Or until I come down in my
dressing gown
# And say, that's it, everyone
# Party over
# You need to go
I'm up early in the morning
# Can you please take your
coat off my bed? Ow!
# Go somewhere to sleep
There's two people in the coats
# People are doing it in the
coats!
# Sex in coats party
Sex in coats party
♪ Sex in coats party. ♪

juicy. See you after the break.

OK, so Joe and Katherine have 18,
Jon and Chris have 31.
APPLAUSE

No.
Why not?
Because you are too far behind.
Why are you being a prick?
OK, fingers on buzzers, it's time
for today's Countdown Conundrum.
Your time starts now.
BELL
What exactly do we have to do?
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
You have to guess what the word
is, it's jumbled up.
BUZZER
Jon.
Oh, I've got it...
I thought it was TINCHIEST.
It's not TINCHIEST. Not even close.
As in, &quot;He is the TINCHIEST Stryder
I have ever seen.&quot;
APPLAUSE
The smallest of the Stryders.
Let's try again.
BELL
CHESTNUTS!
I'll just check, it's not CHESTNUTS.
I'll start the clock again.
BUZZER
Chris.
ITCHINESS. ITCHINESS is...
