<i>I'm rich, biatch.</i>
You filming us?
Hey, man, what's happening?
We were riding.
Car just broke down?
Yeah.
Try it one more time.
Try it one more time.
Short bursts.
Hey, yo, Dave!
What happened?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're...
We stopped the engine.
We can't get it started again.
Yo, Dave!
Uh...
You put too much gas in it.
That's what I'm saying.
I have the butterfly
wide open.
Try it now. Try it now.
Stop, stop, stop.
How much of this
did you spray in there?
<i>He said, "How much of that
did you spray in there?"</i>
<i>How much of this
did you spray in?</i>
I don't know
what his answer is.
<i>That's right. Saturday,
coming at you!</i>
<i>The Block Party of life!</i>
<i>With Kanye West,</i>
<i>Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Common.</i>
<i>Did I mention the Fugees?
Did I mention Dead Prez?</i>
<i>Did I tell you Erykah Badu
was gonna be there?</i>
<i>And Jill Scott's gonna
be there. And The Roots crew
is gonna be there.</i>
<i>And yours truly,
David Chappelle!</i>
<i>That's right!
Once in a lifetime!</i>
<i>I've got the Brooklyn Steppers
behind me.</i>
<i>And we do a little something
like this.</i>
<i>Saturday night,
Saturday afternoon</i>
<i>featuring barbecued chicken
for lunch.</i>
<i>It's a celebration,
bitches.</i>
It's a celebration.
All right, I'm gonna go
talk some stuff
and then we're gonna...
And then,
I'm gonna bring you up, Kanye.
<i>Hey, yo, Brooklyn,
make some noise for Mos Def,
y'all.</i>
<i>Brooklyn.</i>
<i>Bed-Stuy!</i>
<i>Brooklyn!</i>
<i>Let the shouting out begin!</i>
<i>Now throw your
hands up, hustlers, busters,
boosters, hoes, everybody</i>
Most High, we thank you just
for being here with us.
We thank you
for this day, God.
<i>The sun is shining.
They said
it was supposed to rain.</i>
<i>But, God,
you letting your face show
that you want us here.</i>
<i>You want every soul here,
right now.</i>
<i>We thank you for this message
that you sending
through all these people.</i>
<i>We thank you for bringing Dave
to bring us together.</i>
<i>We dreamed of this day
and we ask that you
just utilize our souls</i>
<i>and our spirits and our voices
to glorify you
in all that we do.</i>
<i>We don't forget people
that's poor.</i>
<i>We don't forget
those that's at war right now.</i>
<i>We don't forget our comrades
that's in prison.</i>
<i>We don't forget
our children, God.</i>
<i>And we praying
that you can just be
through us and live through us</i>
<i>so that we can raise
our people up
and raise ourselves up.</i>
<i>We put you first in all we do.</i>
<i>And now just bless
the energy of us
and the people out there.</i>
<i>And allow your message
to be through us.</i>
Amen.
Amen.
<i>In the name of Jesus, in the
name of Allah and the Spirit
of the Ancestors, amen, ashe.</i>
<i>All these people,
what we all have in common?</i>
<i>I think we all have
a very personal message
that they try to get across.</i>
<i>And it's about more
than just making money.</i>
<i>All these people that have
come here to this concert,
before I ever met them,</i>
<i>I was fans of theirs.</i>
<i>So to work with these people,
in this kind of setting,
it's a dream come true.</i>
This is the concert
I've always wanted to see.
<i>Keep your hands up,
hustlers, busters, boosters,
hoes, everybody, fuck that</i>
<i>Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go</i>
<i>Brooklyn</i>
<i>It's your boy, M Def.
Yeah, he back.</i>
<i>Feels good to be home, y'all.</i>
This is
my local coffee shop.
The journey starts here.
Preparing for game day,
Saturday.
We got to get some people
to come to this concert.
I don't think
that'll be so hard.
Hey, Bobby,
guess what he offered us?
What?
He said that there's gonna be
a rap concert in Brooklyn
and if we wanna go,
he'll give us tickets.
Man, I can't rap.
Dave, you know better
than that.
You don't have to rap.
But I'll get up there
and try.
All you gotta do is listen.
What?
How often does a brother
get a chance to chill out
with the probation officers?
On some social stuff.
Man. And some social...
No problems.
I ain't even... I ain't
asking you to turn around,
drop me a cup of urine.
None of that. No cups, man.
Yeah.
No peeing in the cup.
It might look like a lot,
but this is it. These are
the golden tickets.
Wee Willy Wonka
didn't even give out
this many.
This will get you guys there.
It'll get you a hotel
in New York for the night.
All right.
And it'll get you
into the concert.
And it'll get you a ride back.
Okay. We get
in our Cadillac like we...
My Cadillac, I should say.
Like we always do.
And we go drive, go golfing.
<i>It's this little corner store
that we always go to
for snacks.</i>
And the next thing we know,
we see Dave Chappelle.
I was like, "Oh!"
Chappelle,
he grabbed this ticket.
Out of nowhere.
He pulled it out his ass.
We was like, "Oh!"
We were like,
"Where did that come from?"
After we got done
seeing Chappelle,
we went on golfing.
And we going on
to the hole number 11.
Just imagine,
we feeling like this high.
Man, we feeling
like this high.
This high.
Top of the world right now.
This top of the world, man.
You can't crush us.
We untouchable.
Can't crush
none of our feelings.
There's a house to the left.
It's deep
over there to the left.
And the tee right here.
He had to take a piss.
So he respected the house.
You know, he respected it.
I was down
into some woods somewhere.
You know,
on some adventure stuff.
And he went on this side.
You know,
he handled his business,
you know.
Right.
Everybody does it
on the golf course.
It's nothing.
Man.
But...
Some guy comes out
and just says,
"You nigger."
I said, "Oh!" I said, "No."
Man.
It's a new era, though.
I thought it was over.
And this old guy
was so old-school.
I never thought
somebody would say "nigger."
I said, "Oh, my."
And then,
I'm up here
just holding him back.
"No. No."
If it wasn't for him,
it'd been over.
'Cause you know, that's his
private property. We want to
go to Chappelle on Saturday.
<i>Chappelle's Show
Chappelle's Show</i>
<i>Chappelle, Chappelle</i>
<i>Yeah, Chappelle's Show</i>
So, we gotta go.
So we did it for you, Dave.
Yeah.
We didn't whoop nobody's ass
for you, Dave.
It was for you, Dave.
For you, Dave. For you.
Watch your back.
You almost bumped into a pole.
I never steer you wrong.
Anyway, I come here
and get cigarettes.
Nice lady, Miss Hall, owns
this place. I had the pleasure
of meeting her before.
I wanna see if she'll come
listen to some rap music.
Just 'cause she's not a
traditional person to
a rap concert. Look out. Pole.
I'm telling you,
I'll never lie to you.
So, you're ready?
Saturday night?
Bring your Timberlands.
All right.
And get the dance.
Do you think I would
enjoy that at my age,
really and truly?
And I just wanted
people from around
the area that I live in,
that might not normally go
to something like this...
That's right.
...to get a chance
to experience something
like this.
So, I figure,
I'll go to the store.
I come here,
I buy my cigarettes
sometimes in the morning.
I just wanted you to
be able to come in and
do your business and leave.
So...
No, that's why I live here.
Everybody treats me like...
But inside, I was screaming,
"That's Dave Chappelle!"
Hi.
Hi.
How's it going? Yeah.
Do you wanna come in?
Come on in.
I really don't know what
to take to a rap party,
Block Party.
I knew I should have
bought a thong.
<i>I'm trying to catch the beat</i>
<i>I need to catch the beat</i>
<i>I need to catch the beat</i>
<i>I need to catch the beat</i>
<i>Now, throw your
motherfucking hands,
get them high</i>
<i>Throw them high, get them high</i>
<i>And all the girls

to your motherfucking man</i>
<i>Get them high, get them high
Come on, get</i>
<i>Now I ain't never tell you
to put down your hands</i>
<i>Keep them high,

<i>And if you're losing your high
then smoke again</i>
<i>Keep them high</i>
<i>Now, my flow is in the pocket
like wallets</i>
<i>I got the bounce
like hydraulics</i>
<i>I can't call it,
I got the swerve
like alcoholics</i>
<i>My freshman year,
I was going through
hella problems</i>
<i>Till I built up the nerve
to drop my ass up
out of college</i>
<i>My teacher said I'm a loser,
I told her
why don't you kill me</i>
<i>I give a fuck if you feel me
I'm gonna follow my heart</i>
<i>And if you follow the charts
or the plaques or the stacks</i>
<i>You ain't gotta
guess who's back, you see</i>
<i>I'm so shy
you thought I was bashful</i>
<i>but this bastard's flow
will bash your skull</i>
<i>And I will cut your girl
like Pastor Troy</i>
<i>And I don't usually smoke,
but pass the 'dro</i>
<i>And I won't give you
that money that you asking for</i>
<i>Why you think me
and Dame cool?
We assholes</i>
<i>That's why we hear your music
in fast-forward</i>
<i>'Cause we don't wanna hear
that weak shit no more</i>
<i>Now everybody
throw their hands</i>
<i>Get them high,
get them high, yeah</i>
<i>And all the girls
pass the weed
to your motherfucking man</i>
<i>Get them high, get them high
Get them high, yeah</i>
<i>Now I ain't never tell you
to put down your hands</i>
<i>So, keep them high,
keep them high,
keep them high, keep them high</i>
<i>And if you're losing your high
then smoke again</i>
<i>Hey, yo, Kwe, I need you
to spit that shit right now.</i>
<i>Yo, yo, yo</i>
<i>I can't believe this nigga
use my name
for picking up dimes</i>
<i>But never mind,
I need some tracks
He trying to pull tracks out</i>
<i>And my rhymes
is fitting to blow,
he about to blow back South</i>
<i>Well, okay,
you twisted my arm,
I'll assist with the charm</i>
<i>Hey, yo, ain't you
meet that chick at the
conference with your mom?</i>
<i>Her sister's the bomb,
but she got
the bougie behavior</i>
<i>Always got something to say
like a Okay Player hater</i>
<i>Anyway, I don't usually
fuck with the Internet</i>
<i>Or chicks with birth control
stuck to their arm
like Nicorette</i>
<i>You really fucking that much
or trying to get off
cigarettes?</i>
<i>And she think it's fly
She ain't met a real nigga yet</i>
<i>I apologize if I come off
a little inconsiderate</i>
<i>I got the Bubba Kush

<i>Get them high, get them high
Come on, yeah</i>
<i>Now I ain't never tell you

<i>Get them high, get them high</i>
Old people
fucking love me, man.
They love me.
You know you must be doing
something right
if old people like you.
Hi, miss.
Hi.
Do you like rap music?
I like you, man, I tell you.
I'll take that. You want
to come see a rap concert
I'm throwing?
When?
It's in Brooklyn
on Saturday.
Sorry, I can't do that.
I'll get you on the bus.
I'm going to Canada
on a bus.
Canada? You trying to
dodge the war?
I don't know if you like
rap music, but...
No, it's not a question
of liking.
I don't hear well enough
to catch the words.
You know, I got
the concert jump-off
this weekend.
Oh, do you?
I can get you there.
Hell, yeah.
If you get me there, I'll go.
On a bus.
It don't make
no difference to me.
You'll go?
Yeah.
No matter how
we get you there? I ain't
gonna send you on a donkey.
He'll hurt the donkey.
I'm a football player.
I'm 320 pounds.
You play football?
Where? At Central?
No. Hell, no.
Oh, excuse me,
I shouldn't be cursing.
Oh, that's all right. Look.
Pussy hole. You see?
You can say anything.
This is a movie.
You got
a big hat for me?
Yeah.
And the mirror's
right here?
Yeah.
That's the one.
All right,
I'm gonna surprise myself.
Here I go. Damn! Oh, snap!
Pimpalicious.
This a bad coat.
Yeah.
You think I can wear this
to a rap concert?
You sure could.
Where is my money, bitch?
Now, this is
the popular stuff?
Yeah.
All right.
This is current styles.
Look here, bitch.
I'm gonna tell you this
and I'm gonna
tell you this once.
I want my goddamn money.
Tell your wife I said hi.
I can't wait to meet her.
What's she like?
She's the shit.
Red hair, big tits.
Red hair and big titties?
All right,
I'll keep an eye out.
Get her drunk,
she'll show them.
Really?
All right, make sure
we have beer at the concert.
This place is called
HaHa's Pizza, right?
Back in the day,
it was started
by some hippies.
And they had certain
pizza toppings that made you
laugh. Get my drift?
You ordered a mushroom pizza
at this place back in '71,
chances were
you were gonna hallucinate.
<i>Keep them high</i>
<i>Brooklyn, make some noise.</i>
I rolled up on you guys
completely by chance.
What are the odds
that I'd be shooting
the beginning?
It's God.
I'm shooting a concert movie.
That's God.
That's God, man.
<i>I'm trying to think,
how am I gonna get
people to come?</i>
<i>And all of a sudden,
a marching band
crosses the street.</i>
<i>How perfect is that?</i>
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm standing here
with a piece of black history.
The first black man
named Milsapp, right here,
ladies and gentlemen.
And not only
is his name Milsapp,
but he's also the director
of Central State University's
band we got here.
This is not any old band
though, is it?
No, it isn't.
This the drum line.
<i>Mr. Milsapp?
Yes.</i>
<i>All right, how do y'all travel
when you travel?</i>
<i>Very carefully.</i>
We travel by charter bus.
By charter bus?
We gotta have a huddle, guys.
Come on, let's huddle up
real quick.
Look, man. All right,
say I chartered y'all
a bus, right?
Would you all come play
at my concert, Block Party,
in New York?
I don't have a problem
with it.
The whole band?
Yeah, yeah,
with two buses, right?
Yeah.
It's not gonna be more
than two buses, is it?
No, it won't be more
than two buses.
Yeah, man, come on,
rep southwest Ohio, man.
Yes, we would.
You'll do it?
Yes, we would.
Is there a compensation,
or what?
Compensation?
It comes with a sandwich.
Will there be snacks?
Oh, there'll be snacks.
We got...
Don't we got snacks
in the budget?
This is a low-budget movie.
You know how Steven Spielberg
have all them trucks
and stuff?
Got the hookup.
<i>This is it.
We pulled up
in a minivan, baby.</i>
<i>We're working
on a tight budget.</i>
You have to go through the
channels, right? Run it up the
flagpole, that type of thing.
Yeah, and that would
be done expediently.
That could be done.
And now we're just caught up
in a little bureaucracy.
Now, how hot would it be
if these kids got a chance
to come through Bed-Stuy,
beating them drums,
playing them horns?
The whole neighborhood
is amped, screaming.
They're saying "It's CSU!"
That's what we're hoping for.
The anticipation
is killing me.
<i>One</i>

<i>Lord have mercy</i>
<i>Hey, yo, from the first

<i>Whole and not the half of it,

<i>Me and Kweli close like

<i>After this

<i>Shining like an asterisk

<i>All my Brooklyn residents,

<i>Don't believe,

<i>From where

<i>Talib Kweli e-Kweli-ty

<i>We be in Brooklyn,

<i>You know karate

<i>Stop acting

<i>And maybe you can see

<i>That's where it's all
going down, baby.</i>
<i>Stage will be right there
where you guys are standing.</i>
<i>I'm gonna be running up
and down from here.</i>
<i>All this is gonna be people.
I can see it now!</i>
<i>Like a vision. Don't look
at me like I'm crazy.
It's going down!</i>
<i>This is real.</i>
<i>I'm sorry
for screaming like this.</i>
<i>One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli</i>
<i>We came to rock it on

<i>Sing it up!</i>
<i>Singing one, two, three
It's kind of dangerous

<i>They shot 2Pac and Biggie
God bless the day
and this hip-hop</i>
Whose house is this anyway?
This your house?
You know, we're having
a concert in front of your
house Saturday. You excited?
Yes, and you're welcome
to come and rest your loins
at any point.
I can come rest my loins
in the crib, you heard that?
With a glass of champagne.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>today is their fortieth...</i>
Sixth.
<i>Forty-sixth
wedding anniversary.
Good God Almighty.</i>
Thank you.
Hold your applause to the end.
We took a trip
on the Staten Island Ferry,
a little ocean voyage.
Okay.
On the Staten Island...
All right.
To Staten Island.
And, as we walked
in the streets
of Staten Island,
what did we discover
in the gutter, but an angel
broken in seven pieces.
When we both discovered this,
I turned to him,
who was not my husband
at the time,
and I said,
"It's an omen. It's a sign.
"I'm to marry you,
of all people."
Really?
And I did. I married him.
And Sunday is our 46th
wedding anniversary.
I put that angel
back together again.
But after I did, we found
the original, of which there
may be thousands of them.
The original's rather stiff.
Mine is kind of graceful.
<i>So, that's why we call this
Broken Angel.</i>
<i>Because this building
was wrecked and vandalized</i>
<i>and lying in the street.</i>
And I'm putting it
back together again,
better than it was.
Because they bought it,
it kind of had
some sort of meaning.
But if I was a location scout,
and we needed a crack house,
I might refer that place.
Can I see
the whole band
for a moment, please?
Quiet.
Be quiet.
All right.
Upon a discussion
I had with our president
and Mr. David Chappelle,
the performances on Saturday
have been canceled.
Are you serious?
I'm serious.
However, there has been
a change in plans.
We will be traveling
to New York.
<i>I've stood here
in these streets of men</i>
<i>Dying a little</i>
<i>That I might comprehend</i>
<i>A concept like purpose
or worry there</i>
<i>The earth is mine
by divine prophecy I'm told</i>
<i>I am free if I'm meek</i>
<i>Greetings. Cody Chesnutt,
The Headphone Masterpiece.</i>
By the grace of Almighty God,
here for the celebration.
Miss, I'm having a Block Party
on Saturday around the corner.
<i>All you need to do
is bring yourself.</i>
<i>Bring yourself! Bring yourself
to the Block Party, won't you?</i>
<i>Attention, Huxtables.</i>
<i>There is
a Block Party jump-off
right around the corner.</i>
<i>Downing and Quincy.
Downing and Quincy.</i>
<i>Bring Rudy, Theo, Denise...</i>
On the actual block?
It's like a warehouse
where they make chairs.
No human ass
has touched these seats yet.
Some lucky person
is gonna get a chair.
<i>There's like
a nursery school.</i>
<i>There's this ill house called
the Broken Angel house.</i>
<i>Then there's
the Salvation Army.</i>
These guys have been
kind enough to loan us
furniture for the party.
And now we're just kind
of looking around
at furniture,
so that we can be comfortable
on the rooftop
during the concert.
I'm also just taking some time
to look at all this good stuff
that people just throw out.
If I went to a white person's
house and saw this,
I'd be furious.
Think I can play this,
even though it says
"Do not play"?
<i>Midnight, 'round midnight</i>
<i>I think,
right now, man, Dave has
two songs in his repertoire.</i>
<i>He has Round About Midnight
and Misty.</i>
<i>And he... Once he has...</i>
Wait, get...
<i>Go back to Round Midnight.</i>
He always gets to the bridge
and then he does
these real
immaculate arpeggios,
which trips me out.
The fact that
he's not a trained musician,
<i>but he's dedicated
his whole life
to Round About Midnight.</i>
We're dating.
It's called...
Courtship.
Christian courtship.
That's what it's called.
We're dating.
It's called dating.
We've been friends
for how long? A year.
Best friends for a year.
A month.
And a month.
And a day.
And a day.
And a day, a day.
It's a year,
a month and a day.
So, how many hours
and how many minutes
and how many seconds?
Can I breathe your air?
Breathe mine.
<i>That was Round Midnight
I was playing.
That's a Thelonious Monk song.</i>
One of my favorite musicians
because his timing was so ill.
Every comedian
is a stickler for timing.
And Thelonious Monk
was off time,
yet perfectly on time.
You should study it
if you're an aspiring comedian
or an aspiring musician,
you should study it.
Which brings me
to my next point.
Comedians and musicians,
we're like this.
Every comic
wants to be a musician.
Every musician
thinks they're funny.
It's a very strange
relationship that we have.
Some musicians are funny,
some comedians can play.
I'll give you an example.
Mos Def, funny guy.
Jamie Foxx,
good singer and piano player.
So you never know.
You never know what kind
of talents a person has.
I'm mediocre at both,
but have managed
to talk my way into a fortune.
Life is a funny,
unpredictable thing.
<i>So, you do
the drums, right?</i>
<i>And then do
like the straight...
Like, if I say,</i>
<i>"I saw this lady
who was so fat. "
You'd be like, "Really, Dave?"</i>
<i>Like, "How fat was..."</i>
<i>You do the straight man
and then I'll do...
All right, you ready?</i>
<i>But this is how it works.</i>
<i>That you gotta stop
when I say stop. It's gotta
be, like, on a dime.</i>
Okay.
<i>And then keep going again.
Stop, keep going again.</i>
<i>All right.
All right,
so we'll try it out.</i>
<i>But when we do it,
we're gonna practice it
in front of the audience.</i>
<i>This shit never fails.
It's like a walking bassline,</i>
<i>and then like a swing beat,
and then like whatever else...</i>
This is sort of like
making that noise.
<i>All right. That's right.
Okay, it should be like this.</i>
<i>Hey, Mos, what's happening?</i>
<i>Then you be like...
Hey, what's happening, Dave?</i>
<i>Mos, I'm gonna tell you
a little...</i>
<i>How many white people
does it take to screw in
a light bulb?</i>
<i>I don't know, Dave, how many?</i>
<i>None. 'Cause they'll get
a nigga to do it for them.</i>
<i>Carry on.</i>
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>
<i>Just a little warm-up.</i>
<i>All right, all right.</i>
<i>Okay, listen up.</i>
<i>Upon getting your keys
and your luggage,</i>
<i>you can go to your room.</i>
<i>We are going to eat down here,
I believe, in the dining room.</i>
<i>So once you
put your luggage up,
you can come back downstairs.</i>
Glad we're here, though.
Time to relax, get some
sleep before we go and
kick it tomorrow or whatever.
<i>Bed-Stuy!</i>
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>Come on, everybody</i>
<i>Get it up, get it up, what
Everybody</i>
<i>Give it up, give it up, what</i>
<i>Get it up, get it up, what
Everybody</i>
<i>Get it up, get it up, what
Everybody</i>
<i>Give it up, give it up, what</i>
<i>Give it up, give it up, what</i>
<i>Get it up, get it up, what</i>
<i>Get it up, get it up</i>
<i>Hating melodrama</i>
<i>Fellas wanna hover

<i>Express my desire

<i>These record executives

<i>What, are they what?</i>
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>
<i>Revolutionaries,
throw your guns up</i>

<i>Kill all the yapping,

<i>You cats ain't real,
you just a reenactment</i>
<i>Better yet, dramatization</i>
<i>Soon as the director
say action
you start faking</i>
<i>I like the element
of surprise.</i>
Take this concert
for instance.
I would have loved it
if nobody saw it coming.
Now it got leaked
to the press,
people have heard about it,
but they still don't know
where it is.
<i>So imagine. There's gonna be
a group of people
that see it here,</i>
<i>and then, people will hear
about it, but they have no
idea what it looks like.</i>
How'd you find out about this?
Internet.
1 iota. Com.
1 iota.
Oh, through e-mail.
<i>Say it loud, say
Move something</i>
<i>Brooklyn, say it loud, say
Move something</i>
<i>Brooklyn, say it loud, say
Move something</i>
Where you going?
We made it.
Somewhere in Brooklyn.
We don't know.
We don't know.
Gonna have a good time today.
I don't know where I'm going.
I know that I'm going
to some Block Party,
but I don't know who's
performing or... I'm just here
to have a good time.
We're going to Brooklyn.
We're going to Bed-Stuy.
Bed-Stuy, Bed-Stuy.
Do or die,

That's where we think
we're going.
Just get on. Enjoy yourself.
Have a good time. We love you.
There's no...
Y'all got to squeeze,
I'm sorry.
Put three people.
People with small booties
all sit together.
Big booty people,
y'all got to share
with a small booty.
Wow, how you gonna catch me
while I'm in the middle
of breakfast?
This is not a stereotype.
We were hungry and Pathmark
was out of steak.
You guys ready
to get on the road?
Yeah!
<i>Thank you,
thank you very much.</i>
<i>Have you tried the hot dogs?
That's right.</i>
<i>That's right</i>
<i>We're gonna have
a little party tonight</i>
<i>And some jazz comedy</i>
<i>Oh</i>
<i>That's right</i>
We didn't get here
until very late last evening.
And we've only had about four
or five hours' sleep,
most of us.
So we are a little tired,
but we're trying
to weather the storm
and enjoy ourselves
in spite of.
<i>Carry on!</i>
<i>Yeah! We're gonna
bring the house down tomorrow.</i>
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

<i>Y'all know what the Midwest is
Young and restless</i>
<i>Where restless niggas

<i>Next these niggas
might jack your Lexus</i>
<i>Somebody tell these niggas
who Kanye West is</i>
<i>I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death</i>
<i>Top floor the view alone
will leave you breathless</i>
<i>Try to catch it
It's kind of hard</i>
<i>Getting choked by detectives
Yeah, now check the method</i>
<i>They asking us questions
Harass and arrest us</i>
<i>Saying, "We eat pieces of shit
like you for breakfast"</i>
<i>Y'all eat pieces of shit?
What's the basis?</i>
<i>We ain't going nowhere
but got suits and cases</i>
<i>A trunk full of coke

Man, that Kanye West.
Kanye West,
who we came to see,
he came out right away.
He came out, did his thing.
I liked that.
It's a party.
If it wasn't for the rain,
it would have been really
great. But it's still a party.
<i>"Rain, rain</i>
<i>"On my parade</i>
<i>"Five thousand black people
chilling in the rain</i>
<i>"Nineteen white people

<i>"Everybody's welcome</i>
<i>"Trying to find a Mexican</i>
<i>"Very hard to find a Mexican!</i>
<i>"Buenos días.
I know you're out there.
Buenos días.</i>
"Qué?
<i>"That's Spanish
Lil Jon. Qué?</i>
"Qué?
"Sí."
<i>Thank you, bitches.
Good night.</i>
<i>Now, I know you guys
are thinking,</i>
<i>"Dave, where have you learned
how to play the congos?"</i>
<i>Nobody taught me that shit!
I'm black!</i>
<i>It's in my blood!</i>
<i>Throw up my gang sign.</i>
<i>It's bad. Well, no, really,
it means something.
It means ya basta.</i>
Know what I'm saying?
It's Mexican.
<i>For all my compañeros
and compañanas.</i>
<i>This means ya basta.
Enough is enough.</i>
Is that
some Mexican shit?
Yeah.
So if I see some Mexicans
and I throw this up...
<i>And this means...
Ya basta.</i>
<i>Ya basta. And they'll be
like, "All right."</i>
Oh, well, you know.
I never really...
Check with them first.
Yeah, I don't wanna...
Don't have me doing this.
Don't just walk up to Mexicans
and start doing this shit.
<i>Enough is enough.
Ya basta.</i>
We had enough here.
We're ready for better.
Any way.
<i>Next time my wife is feeding

<i>I refuse to be a stereotype
in your box</i>
<i>Never wanna try
to be something I'm not</i>
<i>I think, like,
the more you say with it,</i>
the less airplay you get.
You know, guys like Dead Prez,
they say it all.
But you hardly ever
hear them on the radio.
Because they say things like,
<i>"The White House
is the rock house.</i>
<i>"Uncle Sam is
the motherfucking pusher man.</i>
<i>"What I gotta do
to make you understand?"</i>
You know.
They don't want to hear that
on the radio.
"The White House
is the rock house,"
and all these kinds of things.
But you hear it
at the barber shop
all the time.
<i>Say turn off the radio,
Brooklyn</i>
<i>Turn off that bullshit</i>
<i>Say it
Turn off the radio</i>
<i>Come on, come on
Turn off that bullshit</i>
<i>What's on the radio
Propaganda, mind control</i>
<i>And turning it on is like
Putting on a blindfold</i>
<i>When you bring in the real
You don't get rotation</i>
<i>Unless you take over
the station</i>
<i>And, yeah, I know
it's part of their plans</i>
<i>To make us think
it's all about
Party and dancing</i>
<i>And, yo, it might sound good
when you spitting your rap</i>
<i>But in reality,
don't nobody live like that</i>
<i>You wanna know
what kind of nigga I am?</i>
<i>Let me tell you
about the nigga I'm not</i>
<i>I don't fuck with the cops</i>
<i>Like it gotta be hot</i>
<i>I ain't gotta love it,
even if they play it a lot</i>
<i>How many people they reach?
How they use music to teach?</i>
<i>A radio program
ain't a figure of speech</i>
<i>Don't sleep, 'cause you could
be a radio freak</i>
<i>My nigga, turn off the radio

Or how about when they say,
<i>"Who shot Biggie Smalls?
If we don't get them,
they gonna get us all. "</i>
<i>"I'm up for running up
on them crackers
in their city hall. "</i>
You'll never hear that shit
on the radio.
Never in a million years
will you hear somebody
say on the radio,
"I'm up for running up on
some crackers in city hall."
And
people have stopped asking
who shot Biggie Smalls.
But if you in show business
and black, you'll wonder
about that every day.
'Cause they might
get you, too.
Biggie Smalls was
in this daycare center.
Miss Jenkins, Miss Green,
Miss Pennick
was their teachers.
And they're still here.
They've been here
for the past 30 years.
Man. So the next Biggie Smalls
might be here now.
You don't even know.
He may be.
That's it. This is what
I just finished telling you.
All right. All right.
Okay.
So out of here,
you will get the next
star. Maybe...
Maybe Biggie Smalls.
...another Biggie Smalls.
This the old daycare center
right here, man.
You were in here, too?
No, I didn't go here,
though my little nephew
used to go here.
I used to always come here
to pick up my nephew.
One of my niggas
from Junior MAFIA,
his mom used to work in here.
Word?
You know,
just all around the way, man.
All down here.
So the whole Junior MAFIA's
from around this way?
Yeah. Yeah, everybody.
Kim, everybody.
Yeah, Kim used to live...
She lived
on the other St. James.
That's two blocks
down this way on Lafayette.
Jay-Z, he from Marcy projects.
That ain't but about
two, three blocks
on that side.
Junior MAFIA, Big, he's two
blocks back down this way,
you know what I'm saying?
So, I mean, you know,
we kind of
put it down ourselves.
You influenced
the whole world.
Yeah, yeah.
For sure, for sure.
It's just like it's a 'hood
thing, man. Like we ain't got
shit to do out here.
That's all you got to do,
is music, man.
That was something that kept
a lot of us niggas
out of trouble.
Kept motherfuckers
off the corner.
Would have been police
out there fucking with you.
You go in the crib,
you listen to some music.
That's the only thing
that kind of cleared
the nigga head.
And the money
never came between you?
No, never that. Never that.
'Cause we all
grew up together.
At the end of the day,
I ain't gotta make
another record no more,
but those will always
be my niggas,
'cause I grew up with them.
It was way bigger
than hip-hop.
Kind of like,
that was our work.
<i>Those were my niggas
right there.
I grew up with them</i>
<i>since we was like this,
so nothing would ever
come between us.</i>
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>
Me, on the other hand,
I don't see
none of my old friends.
Them motherfuckers is crazy.
And if you watching this,
I mean that shit.
<i>If you know this here, say it.</i>
<i>It's bigger than hip-hop
Hip-hop, hip-hop</i>
<i>It's bigger than
Say it</i>
<i>What it bigger than?
Say it</i>
<i>What it bigger than?
Say it</i>
<i>What it bigger than?</i>
<i>One thing about music
When it hit, you feel no pain</i>
<i>White folks say
it controls your brain</i>
<i>I know better than that
That's game,
and we ready for that</i>
<i>Two soldiers head of the pack
Matter of fact,
who got the gat?</i>
<i>And where my army at?</i>
<i>Rather attack and not react</i>
<i>Back the beats,
it don't reflect
on how many records get sold</i>
<i>On sex, drugs,
and rock and roll</i>
<i>Whether your project
gets put on hold</i>
<i>In the real world
We just people with ideas</i>
<i>They just like me and you
When the smoke and camera
disappear</i>
<i>In the real world
It's bigger than all these
fake-ass records</i>
<i>When poor folks
got the millions
and my sisters get respect</i>
<i>If you check, one, two
My word of advice to you
is just relax</i>
<i>Just do what you got to do
If that don't work
then here's the facts</i>
<i>If you a fighter, rider,
biter, flame-igniter,
crowd-exciter</i>
<i>Or you wanna just get high,
then just say it</i>
<i>But then if you a liar,
liar, pants on fire
Wolf-crier, agent with a wire</i>
<i>I'm gonna know it
when I play it
Say it</i>
<i>What it bigger than?</i>
<i>It's bigger than hip-hop
Hip-hop, hip-hop</i>
<i>Who shot 2Pac?
If we don't get them,
they gonna get us all</i>
<i>I'm down for running up on

<i>We ride for y'all
All my dawgs, stay real</i>
<i>Nigga, don't think
your record deal</i>
<i>Gonna feed your seeds
and pay your bills</i>
<i>Because they're not</i>
<i>MCs get a little bit of love
And think they hot</i>
<i>Talking about
how much money they got</i>
<i>Nigga, all y'all records
sound the same</i>
<i>I sick of that fake thug,
R&B, rap scenario
All day on the radio</i>
<i>Same scenes in the video</i>
<i>Monotonous material
Y'all don't hear me, though</i>
<i>These record labels
sling our tapes like dope</i>
<i>You can be next in line
and signed</i>
<i>and still be writing rhymes
and broke</i>
<i>You rather have a Lexus
or justice?
A dream or some substance?</i>
<i>A Beemer,
a necklace or freedom?</i>
<i>See, a nigga like me
don't player-hate
I just stay awake</i>
<i>This is real hip-hop,
and it don't stop</i>
<i>Till we get them crackers

This is especially
for Dead Prez.
Pow!
<i>The most revolutionary shoe
known to man.
Ya basta!</i>
<i>Who knew that?
Ya basta.
Ya basta.</i>
Enough is enough,
motherfuckers.
You need to get us
in a skit, Dave.
You know what I'm saying?
We can do this.
We can do this.
I'll dance all day.
<i>How many people
in the audience can MC?</i>
<i>Nine hundred MCs.</i>
<i>Mr. T.</i>
<i>Bring up Mr. T.</i>
<i>I wanna battle you.</i>
<i>I pity you, fool.</i>
<i>I pity the fool
that tries to battle
Dave Chappelle.</i>
<i>Where's your time machine
parked?</i>
<i>He got a Mohawk, man.</i>
<i>Come on, man,
you weigh more than me.
God damn!</i>
<i>I pity the fool!</i>
<i>Drink the milk, B.A.</i>
<i>Here's the kicker.</i>
<i>I'm not giving you a mike.
Good luck!</i>
You know, I'm from DC,
where y'all are from.
<i>You from DC? For real?</i>
You know,
we rough it off down there.
<i>He said he's roughing off.</i>
<i>Does that mean that I should
wash my hands?</i>
<i>He's roughing off!</i>
<i>Vaseline!</i>
<i>See, roughing off
is when we take the mike.</i>
<i>All right, hold on.
All right! Take it easy!</i>
<i>You know I got security,
nigga. I'll get you yoked.</i>
<i>I will get you...</i>
<i>I'm worth too much money now,
motherfucker.</i>
<i>There's snipers on the roof,
all kinds of shit!</i>
<i>That's right, Mr. T.
I pity the fool!</i>
<i>I pity the fool
that fuck with me.</i>
<i>What's up, BK?</i>
<i>Yo. It's like this.</i>
<i>This my homie here,
he's from DC, right?</i>
<i>Yo, son.
What's up with that bald head?</i>
<i>I think you got to get
something new
or you'll be dead</i>
<i>Yo, Dave,
I ain't gonna do you like that</i>
<i>'Cause I'm gonna come to you
real fat with a bat</i>
<i>Yo, I'm rapping like this
'cause I don't
really freestyle</i>
<i>I'm rapping like this
'cause I've traveled
many miles</i>
<i>"Please to meet you," I holler
"I'll see you at the gate"</i>
<i>After that, yeah
That shit's gonna be late</i>
<i>Time out, everybody.</i>
<i>First of all, don't ever boo
a rapper on this stage.</i>
<i>The way that he rhymed "gate"
with "late" is genius!</i>
<i>And if you can't see that,
there's something wrong
with you!</i>
<i>Anybody can rhyme like that.</i>
<i>You got nice shoes.</i>
<i>Nigga's got blues.</i>
<i>New York City.</i>
<i>Something about big titties.
You could just do that
all day.</i>
<i>Bring back on that beat!</i>
<i>Uh!</i>
<i>Time out, time out, time out!</i>
<i>Why everybody got to go "uh"
before they freestyle? Uh!</i>
<i>Uh!</i>
<i>All right, go ahead.
Bring that beat back.
Bring that beat back!</i>
<i>I didn't forget about you!</i>
<i>It's time
to go to school</i>
<i>Like Mr. T said,
"I pity the fool!"</i>
<i>That ain't platinum
it's not even silver</i>
<i>It's just a piece of shit
I told you that shit
don't rhyme</i>
<i>What? What?</i>
<i>Look at that! Huh?</i>
<i>You said "Free Tibet"
Ain't no niggas in Tibet!</i>
<i>It's probably a free t-shirt!</i>
<i>My flow is too ill.</i>
<i>Damn, I thought
that was a real person.</i>
<i>That's a puppet. God damn!</i>
<i>This puppet had me fooled.</i>
<i>I was like, he's gonna
get in trouble smoking
all this weed out here.</i>
<i>Guy got his hand
up a Jamaican midget's ass.</i>
<i>Doing all...</i>
<i>I didn't know it was a puppet!</i>
<i>All right.
Oh yeah, give it up
for my man, Mr. T.</i>
<i>His cereal is in stores.</i>
<i>Mr. T!</i>
Can I get somebody
to beatbox for me?
I'll beatbox.
How do you want your beat?
All right.
<i>Many women tell me
my style is so different</i>
<i>It is kind of good
but let's be specific</i>
<i>I'm not the type to be rushing</i>
<i>I'm not the type of guy
who asks
a whole lot of questions</i>
<i>Like where you going,
where you been
and can we</i>
<i>have sex all the time?
That's not important to D</i>
<i>I only date girls
who have men or relations</i>
<i>So to be with me
is like a mini vacation</i>
<i>So I don't let no girl
spend my money like she crazy</i>
<i>Half on drinks
on the room and the baby</i>
<i>I don't argue,
I control myself</i>
<i>'Cause I don't have to be loud
or physical to be felt</i>
<i>'Cause after it's all over
we realize it was nothing</i>
<i>I walk away and later
return and still be...</i>
<i>You never have to worry
that I lie</i>
<i>'Cause I don't have to</i>
<i>'Cause I'm
the nigga on the side</i>
That's right.
All right,
I'll see you Saturday, man.
All right!
<i>Saturday.</i>
<i>2:00.</i>
<i>Be there or be square,
as they say.</i>
<i>She knew what I was going for.
You heard that, buddy?</i>
<i>Quincy and Downing Street.</i>
How do you spell Downing?
<i>Downing? I don't know,
I went to public school.</i>
<i>D-O-W-N-N-I-G?</i>
When you said you was
doing it over there,
I was like, "Fuck."
You grew up over there?
My whole childhood...
Hey, that's crazy.
...was in the Stuy.
<i>So it's a trip.
The Stuy is still, like,</i>
<i>the Stuy.</i>
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>
<i>This shit has been like that</i>
<i>forever.</i>
<i>It's actually better now
than it has been.
In certain areas, anyway.</i>
Some of it look like
<i>when The Cosby Show
comes back
from commercial break.</i>
And some of it look like
<i>when Good Times came back
from the commercial break.</i>
But it could be
in the same block.
Like, yeah,
you could be in one block,
<i>and then you'd turn the corner
and you'd be like, "Oh, shit."</i>
Tyrone in school?
Folks, right now
I'm sitting in the office
of none other than Luz Grice.
She is the director
of the daycare center
<i>whose roof
we'll be shooting on Saturday.</i>
I just wanted to say
thank you, first of all,
for letting us shoot here.
Thank you.

You know, that's what I like
about Bed-Stuy.
You say it's a mixed area.
Blacks and Hispanics.
Blacks, Hispanics,
and a few Caucasians
coming into the neighborhood.
Do you got a limo?
Do I have a limo?
Today I have a limo.
Thank you. Thank you.
Can we ride in it?
If you guys could ride

Wait a minute!

<i>Back in the day</i>
<i>All we needed was
Bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-dop</i>
<i>Hey</i>
<i>Oh, well, well, well</i>
<i>Look, gotta say</i>
<i>Soul flower

<i>Hey, child</i>
<i>Just give me that
bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-dop</i>
Let me just say, just because
you guys are younger than me,
don't think for a second
I'm gonna take it easy on you.
I play to win.
Yeah, you can't win.
I'm putting some money
on the table.
I'm just kidding.
Gambling is wrong, kids.
<i>James, watch this.</i>
<i>We gonna go back, all right?</i>
Say good morning.
Good morning!
Good morning, kids.
Say, "Good morning,
Mr. Chappelle."
Good morning, Mr. Chappelle.
Thanks. Can you say,
"Good morning,
Mr. Black Bush?"
Good morning,
Mr. Black Bush.
I love kids. Thank you.
<i>The laughing, the singing
The jamming, the talking</i>

<i>It's always more
interesting to look at
the person behind the image.</i>
<i>Everyone's got a difference
between their personal life
and their public life.</i>
<i>You kind of have to.
Not every part of you
can be for sale, right?</i>
But this is something
where I just wanted
to get a feeling of,
like, that third dimension.
<i>Something just a little bit
beyond that superficial image.</i>
<i>Just meet the people
beyond the gold
or whatever it is</i>
<i>that their image is.</i>
<i>That, you know,</i>
<i>you hear someone like
Erykah Badu's music and you
get the idea she's so serious,</i>
<i>but she's a hilarious person.
You'd never know this.</i>
<i>So hopefully we hang out here
for 12 hours together,</i>
<i>we perform together,
or we talk together,</i>
<i>maybe we get to see
a little bit more
about what we're all about.</i>
Hey, look at Erykah!
Go ahead, girl.
I really love
that woman.
We all have our own thing.
That's the magic.
That everybody comes with
their own sense of strength
and their own queendom.
Mine could never compare
to hers, and hers could never
compare to mine.
<i>Love of my life</i>
<i>You are my friend</i>
<i>Love of my life</i>
<i>I can depend</i>
<i>Love of my life</i>
<i>Without you, baby</i>
<i>Feels like a
simple true love, yeah</i>
<i>But the shit didn't clear</i>
<i>Y'all know how I met her</i>
<i>We broke up
and got back together</i>
<i>To get her back
I had to sweat her</i>
<i>Thought she'd roll
with bad boys forever</i>
<i>In many ways
them boys made her better</i>
<i>To grow I had to let her
Let her</i>
<i>She needed cheddar
and I understood that</i>
<i>Looking at cheese
that don't make her
a 'hood rat</i>
<i>In fact she's a queen to me
Her light beams on me</i>
<i>I love it when she sings to me
It's like</i>
<i>Ooh, you know
you rock my world</i>
<i>And you be boy</i>
<i>And I'll be girl</i>
<i>And it don't stop</i>
<i>Until the break of dawn</i>
<i>Sing it, y'all,
come on</i>
<i>It don't, it don't
It don't, it don't</i>
She jumped off
into the crowd's arms.
That was exciting.
<i>Yes, yes, y'all
And you don't stop</i>
<i>We like to rock to the beat
And you don't stop</i>
<i>Kool Herc in the house
And you don't stop</i>
<i>That chick right there
has definitely led the way</i>
<i>for me
and a lot of other sisters.</i>
<i>You know, I appreciate it.</i>
Are you nervous
you're gonna perform
after her?
I'm trying to get
your feelings out.
Have you ever
seen me perform?
I am the lady, Jill Scott.
I am a poet and a singer
and a lot of other things.
And this is my pimple,
Herbert.
He arrived today
and he decided to stay.
So we'll see
his performance tomorrow.
They're fixing me.
Now I can't see him.
He said,
"Can I see your pimple?" No.
<i>Woke up this morning</i>
<i>With a smile on my face</i>
<i>Jumped out of bed</i>
<i>Took a shower</i>
<i>And I cleaned up my place</i>
<i>Made me some breakfast</i>
<i>I had some toast
and two scrambled eggs</i>
<i>Grabbed my keys
Grabbed my purse</i>
<i>Grabbed my jacket
Off to work</i>
<i>Beaming all the way</i>
<i>You love me, baby</i>
<i>You love me, baby
You love me, baby</i>
<i>Is it the way</i>
<i>You love me, baby</i>
<i>I know.</i>
Jill Scott. I love her.
I've seen Mos Def.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited!
Oh, it's wonderful.
It's great being out here
in New York for my first time.
I feel kind of like
I'm at home.
Yeah.
Seeing all these people
out here with locks,
it's comfortable.
You know,
it's nice, though.
See, you can't come
to Brooklyn
without coming to the rooftop.
This is New York
when you're on the rooftop.
Every time you show a movie,
it always show somebody
on the rooftop.
This is it.
So we here doing it.
On a rooftop.
The barbeque...
You should see
the lovely women.
<i>All of us have...
What we have in common</i>
is that our audience
doesn't look like us.
And it's the same for him.
Because of whatever vehicle
that he's working at the time,
it attracts
a certain demographic.
And I guess around the time
when the thing
that was out for him
<i>was, you know, like people
knowing about Half Baked.</i>
<i>And it was like post-9l11.</i>
So, pretty much like...
The audience was
full of, like,
these wild frat boys, like,
you know, like,
that just wanted him
to do his character.
'Cause he was telling stories,
they would always
interrupt his narrative.
But tell them what I said,
that's when
the sniper was out,
what did I say?
I said
the sniper was black.
Oh. We, we...
Yeah...
Did I not say that?
Yeah. He predicted
that the DC Sniper...
Was black.
...was black.
'Cause he was taking
weekends off.
What kind of white sniper's
gonna do some shit like that?
A white sniper's
up early, killing.

<i>The party is not over.</i>
<i>The Roots
used to hold jam sessions</i>
<i>at this club called Wetlands
in New York City
every Sunday night.</i>
<i>So, a lot of the times,
we were...
The Roots were the house band.</i>
And Jill would get up
and do something.
Then Talib would be there,
he'd do something.
Then Common would be there
and he'd do something.
And Erykah would be there
and do something.
<i>And Mos would get up,
the same thing, you know.</i>
So, it's not even surprising
that these are
the particular artists
that are chosen.
You know, like, all of us
were interacting
with each other,
even before
we all had record contracts.

That's Fred Hampton Jr.
That's Fred Hampton.
Fred Hampton Jr?
What's up, baby?
Fred Hampton Jr.,
the gentleman
that was on camera
not long ago
is a good friend of mine,
comrade, and he's an excellent
gentleman.
He's the son of Fred Hampton,
who was a young
18-, 19-year-old Black Panther
in Chicago,
working with people
in the communities,
in the streets
and the police came
and killed him in his bed
with his woman,
and his newborn...
His yet-to-be-born son
in his woman's belly.
Which is Chairman Fred
over here.
Free all political prisoners.
Don't edit that.
Don't cut that.
Make sure you put that
on there.
Free all political prisoners.
Make sure that on there.
Don't edit. Don't cut it.
In the raw, no mix, no segue.
Free Mumia Abu-Jamal,
Sundiata Acoli
and all political prisoners.
Free the New York Three.
Don't edit that. Make sure
they go there. Uncut.
<i>Tell it, Fred Hampton.</i>
<i>Right on. Right on.
Heads up, eyes open
and fists clenched.</i>
<i>Heads up, eyes open
and fists clenched.</i>
<i>Heads up, eyes open,
fists clenched.</i>
<i>Look here, right on.
Say, "Power to the people."</i>
<i>Power to the people.</i>
<i>Right on. We sense a lot
of talk going around
about terrorism.</i>
<i>We say black people
are the O. V. S, the original
victims of terrorism.</i>
<i>We say political prisoners
are victims of terrorism.</i>
<i>We say our position is
"Free them all."</i>
<i>We say,
those soldiers in Attica,
free them all.</i>
<i>What's the call?
Free them all.</i>
<i>Mumia Abu-Jamal.
Free them all.</i>
<i>Sundiata Acoli.
Free them all.</i>
<i>Ruchell Cinque Magee!
Free them all.</i>
<i>The New York Three.
Free them all.</i>
<i>Man, we say,
free all political prisoners
and prisoners of war.</i>
<i>Power to the people.
Free them all.</i>
<i>To be free, to be free
To be free, to be free</i>
<i>To be free, to be free
To be free, to be free</i>
<i>To be free</i>
<i>To be free</i>
<i>Break it down</i>
<i>To be free, to be free</i>
All right, listen.
We're going to settle this
racial shit right now.
We're playing these
white people for our freedom.
"Can Dave Chappelle ball?"
No, I can't ball,
motherfucker.
What do you mean, can I ball?
Y'all missed it.
You was reloading the camera,
I was all the way
on the other court.
Tell them what I did.
They'll never believe me.
All right, here I am.
Okay, look. This is me.
I'm all the way back,
I dribble,
get my confidence, aim, fire.

<i>Talib Kweli, Brooklyn,
New York City.</i>
<i>Black Star Embassy
is in the building.</i>
<i>Brooklyn, do you feel
good tonight?</i>
<i>I know I do.</i>
<i>What do you
think of rock music
and hip-hop?</i>
Well, personally,
I am for classical music.
I play the piano.
I want to play.
And I wish to marry,
when I die,
Sergei Rachmaninoff.
I am terribly in love
with him.
Thank you.
Over my dead body.
Well, it would have to be,
wouldn't it?
I guess so, Arthur.
That's very normal.
You know,
I don't like rap music.
Because rap music composes
a lot of foul language,
and I don't think
it's proper for children.
I don't even think
it's proper for aduIts either
to be using that type
of language.
<i>Hey, Mos.
Hey, Dave.</i>
<i>You know, I was in the public
restroom the other day...
It's a long story.</i>
<i>This guy was peeing

but notice.</i>
<i>His dick was so small...</i>
<i>How small was it, Dave?</i>
<i>He peed on his balls.</i>
<i>All day, babe.
We could do this all day long.</i>
<i>All day long.</i>

<i>Hey, Mos.
Hey, Dave.</i>
<i>Did I ever tell you the one

prostitute?</i>
<i>No, I don't believe
you did.</i>
<i>Well, it's a funny story.</i>
<i>She actually had a vagina
surgically implanted
in her hip.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.
Yeah.</i>
<i>So she could make some money

<i>Oh, it goes on like this
for days and days and days.</i>
<i>We just tell straight jokes.
That's it, we'll kill them.</i>
<i>All right, everybody,
listen up.</i>
<i>Listen up, there's been
some technical difficulties.</i>
<i>Listen, I'm gonna tell you
what happened.</i>
<i>As you all know,</i>
<i>we were expecting to have
Lauryn Hill close the show.</i>
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>Columbia Records
would not clear
any of her songs.</i>
<i>Lucky for us,</i>
<i>Lauryn Hill came up
with an alternative solution.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
make some noise for a miracle.</i>
<i>The Fugees.</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Black Star Jack Bush</i>
<i>Put your hands up,
get your hands up</i>
<i>One, two, three,
put your hands up</i>
<i>Get your hands up,
get your hands up</i>
<i>Get your hands up</i>
<i>Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.</i>
<i>Yo, Mona Lisa</i>
<i>Can I get a date on Friday
And if you're busy</i>
<i>I wouldn't mind
taking Saturday</i>
<i>Round up the posse
Fugee comin' around the way</i>
<i>Nappy heads in the zone
And we ain't going home</i>
<i>Put your hands in the air
right now.</i>
<i>I've been waiting
for this shit!</i>
<i>Yo! A cheeba cheeba, y'all
Well I'm a Libra, y'all</i>
<i>Yes, yes, y'all,
and it don't stop</i>
<i>A cheeba cheeba y'all,
well I'm a Libra y'all</i>
<i>Yes, yes, y'all, let's
Yo</i>
<i>You wanna battle swing
I bring commanding men
like I was king</i>
<i>In all your dreams
I write the horror flick
of Stephen King</i>
<i>Cling to false also
those papers say ock</i>
<i>I got tired of the fat lady
So I sing to my own opera</i>
<i>Ba-lang-balang-balang
- to-de-man-de-rock
'cause I love thee</i>
<i>If you live by the sword
you will be die by the gun</i>
<i>'Cause all guys tell lies
and poor girls commit sin</i>
<i>I was ordered the code red
but now I'm chillin'
with A Few Good Men</i>
<i>Assassination on the kid
from the capital</i>
<i>I never played a soap opera
Now I'm in General Hospital</i>
<i>Condition critical
Spirit overrules the physical</i>
<i>So if I die,
catch me at the funeral</i>
<i>I'll fly away, oh glory
With a mike in my hand</i>
<i>To a land where only
And the angels write raps
on holy paper</i>
<i>I said I'm lookin' for Jesus
He said take the escalator</i>
<i>One flight up is guaranteed
I'll be there</i>
<i>My sister'd be there
I want to see everybody
like this</i>
<i>Yo, Mona Lisa</i>
<i>Stop, Brooklyn!</i>
<i>Yo!</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Lauryn Hill!</i>
<i>Yo, I don't puff blunts
so I always got my breath</i>
<i>Never had to battle
with a bulletproof vest</i>
<i>They call me cock-weasel
but I still cave a chest</i>
<i>I don't wear Jheri curls
'cause I'm not from the West</i>
<i>No disrespect to the West,
true indeed</i>
<i>I rock it to the East,
the East is the seed, yo</i>
<i>To see that them days back
Yo, sheepskins and Hot Tracks</i>
<i>Peace to Mr. Magic
Things are getting tragic</i>
<i>Now we on some new stuff</i>
<i>Ku Klux, whatcha gonna do</i>
<i>Kids are actin' oh</i>
<i>Yeah, put your hands up.
Lauryn Hill's in the building.</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>
<i>Praswell,
where you at? Come on.</i>
<i>Hey, yo, a battle is a battle
but a battle's not a battle</i>
<i>If it's...
If your snake doesn't rattle</i>
<i>'Cause my style,
it's old as a reptile</i>
<i>As new as a new Nile
As new as a new child</i>
<i>Come follow me
to the land of Abraham</i>
<i>This land's your land,
this land's my land</i>
<i>The blacker the black man
The better the next man</i>
<i>Yo, some nappy heads
need to check they necks
for red</i>
<i>Brother, let me
ask you something.</i>
<i>When you got the word</i>
<i>that the Fugees
is coming back together to...</i>
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>
<i>I didn't believe it 'cause...
You know, what happened is,
I got a call.</i>
<i>Yo, I said, "Fugee what?"</i>
<i>I said, "Who is this?"</i>
<i>Then I got a call from Clef.</i>
And you know,
I still don't know
the science on it.
I mean, you know,
both of us,
speaking for both of us,
yo, it's like, when we
see Lauryn, you know what
I'm saying?
It's like, we just,
like, speechless,
you know what I mean?
<i>Yeah. 'Cause she was singing</i>
<i>Killing Me Softly last night.</i>
She was like...
We was just like,
"God damn, she's a beast."
Like, I'm a fan. I mean, yeah,
you know, me and Clef went
through our little bullshit.
Well, people go through that.
You know what I'm saying?
But I think, like they say,
to err is human,
but to forgive is divine.
You know
what I'm saying? So...
We just came together.
'Cause I'm a fan
of both Clef and Lauryn.
Even though I'm
a part of the group,
I'm a fan of them,
<i>and when she started singing
Killing Me Softly,</i>
<i>I almost wanted to cry.</i>
<i>Strumming my pain
with his fingers</i>
<i>Singing my life</i>
<i>With his words</i>
<i>Killing me softly
with his song</i>
<i>Killing me softly</i>
<i>with his song</i>
<i>Telling my whole life</i>
<i>with his words</i>
<i>Killing me softly</i>
Lauryn!
<i>... with his song</i>
<i>I heard he sang
a good song, yes</i>
<i>And I heard
that he had a style</i>
<i>And so I came to see him</i>
<i>And listen for a while</i>
<i>And there he was</i>
<i>This young boy</i>
<i>singing</i>
<i>straight and strong</i>
<i>Strumming my pain
with his fingers</i>
<i>Singing my life with his words</i>
<i>He was killing me softly
with his song</i>
<i>Killing me softly</i>
<i>with his song</i>
<i>Telling my whole life</i>
<i>with his words</i>
<i>Killing me softly</i>
<i>with his song</i>
<i>Yo!</i>
<i>What, what?</i>
<i>I heard he had a style</i>
<i>Come on</i>
<i>And so I came to see him</i>
<i>And listen for a while
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>And there he was,
this young boy</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>A stranger to my eyes
Check it</i>
<i>Strumming my pain
with his fingers</i>
<i>One time</i>
<i>Singing my life with his words</i>
<i>Two time
Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Killing me softly
with his song</i>
<i>Killing me softly</i>
<i>with his song</i>
<i>Telling my whole life
Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>with his words</i>
<i>Killing me softly
Yeah, yo</i>
<i>Softly with his song</i>
<i>Yo, L-Boogie,
take it to the bridge</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Sing it
Oh, yeah</i>
<i>Where y'all been?</i>
<i>What'd you...
You said, where I've been?</i>
<i>You see,
that's where I've been.</i>
<i>See, that's where I've been.</i>
<i>Yeah.
You see where I've been?</i>
<i>Yeah, the first day
that we rehearsed, it was...</i>
You know, it was familiar.
You could feel why...
You know.
Why we had made music together
in the first place.
'Cause there was a certain
synergy at the time.
You know, I was... I came from
the straight-up suburbs,
you know,
of South Orange, New Jersey.
You know, I went to,
you know, a school that was
probably like 75 percent...
White.
...white, middle-class,
Jewish, you know.
And from,
you know, hardworking parents.
And I went to school
and met Pras first,
who had known my brother.
And he introduced me
to Wyclef.
I remember the first
studio sessions.
I guess Pras was paying
for some place, this other
studio at East Orange.
And I walked in,
and we were
recording the song,
and then Wyclef shows up.
And that was like, you know,
much earlier times.
So he had on
this big, velvet crown,
you know.
This is around the time...
Remember when everything
was Batman?
Big Batman buttons.
Y'all didn't do that
down south?
Okay, well,
a few people did that. Okay.
But he had on these
patent leather boots
with these big
police badge things
on the boots,
with his pants tucked in,
with a velvet hat.
And he came in
and he started...
He started doing like,
some real like
Jamaican-type patois.
So for like
the first five years
that I knew them,
I had no idea
they were Haitian.
You know, I thought t
hey were Jamaican.
'Cause they just, you know...
You know, they talk like that.
What would you do
if you was president?
If I was president,
I would stop the war.
I would provide, like,
a whole lot more people
with job opportunities.
I would give everybody
in this band that need it
scholarships.
I would...
Amen.
All right.
Right there!
Scholarships!
Yo, what would you do
if you was president, thug?
I'd give, like, everybody,
like, more scholarships
that who needed them.
She said scholarships
already, man.
Don't be biting
what she said.
Financial aid.
For who needs it.
What was that word,
"financial aid"?
Yeah.
'Cause my dude Matlock
had to go back,
and I wish he was still here.
That's what it is.
So we're gonna do this song
right here.
<i>If I was president</i>
<i>I'd get elected on Friday</i>
<i>Assassinated on Saturday</i>
<i>Buried on Sunday</i>
<i>Then go back to work on Monday</i>
<i>If I was president</i>
<i>If I was president</i>
<i>If I was president
Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Instead of spending
billions on the war</i>
<i>We can use that money</i>
<i>So we can feed the poor</i>
<i>'Cause I know someone
in Flatbush</i>
<i>When it rains,
that's when they shower</i>
<i>Screaming "fight the power"</i>
<i>That's when
the vulture devours</i>
<i>If I was president</i>
<i>I'd get elected on Friday</i>
<i>Assassinated on Saturday</i>
<i>Buried on Sunday</i>
<i>Then go back to work on Monday</i>
<i>If I was president</i>
<i>If I was president</i>
<i>If I was president</i>
Boom!
It's good to see all these
black people in college.
You know what I'm saying?
And listen, man,
I'm gonna tell y'all
like this.
Don't blame the white man
for nothing. Get yours,
you understand?
I came to this country,
I ain't know how
to speak English.
I made something of myself.
I went to the library.
English is like my third
language. I just learned how
to speak English.
<i>So the thing about all
of that, "Yo, the white man
responsible for that"...</i>
White man
ain't responsible for shit.
They got libraries
in the 'hood.
And if they don't got
libraries, tell your mayor,
your governor, whoever,
in your county,
to put some motherfucking
libraries in the 'hood.
I know what the camera's
saying. I shouldn't be cursing
to you kids,
but this shit is all over
the Internet anyway.
<i>Holy shit!</i>
<i>Excuse my language.</i>
<i>Man, listen.</i>
<i>There's nothing we can't do.</i>
<i>Let's all go from here, man,
and try to do some good.</i>
<i>God bless you all.
Thank you
for letting me come here.</i>
<i>Thank you, all the artists,
for being here.</i>
<i>We shook up the world.</i>
<i>We shook up the world!</i>
<i>Good night. God bless you.</i>
You know what? I'm gonna
tell you right now,
I'll never forget this.
This is the best single day
of my career.
I'm proud. I'm so happy.
Thank you.
Thank you for sharing it
with me, ma'am.
Hey, my pleasure.
Thank you
for letting us be here.
My pleasure.
Come back.
Oh, I'll be back, Luz.
You haven't seen
the last of me.
I don't want to see...
<i>Though we are
parting ways, remember this</i>
<i>We shall come around</i>
<i>To touch eyes again</i>
<i>Love is the foundation</i>
<i>The purpose be to recycle life</i>
<i>The promise shall bring
us to one</i>
<i>beating heart in the end</i>
Everybody was so
down-to-earth,
and just hung out
<i>and gave us their time.
We had a good time.</i>
Say something to my mom,
real quick.
Mama. Hold on one second.
Your son's smoking crack.
Put that pipe down.
What are you doing?
And it doesn't matter
who you are, what you are,
what you've come from,
you can do what you want.
'Cause all of those people out
there, they're celebrities,
they're in high places,
but they're regular,
just like me.
<i>They was happy
to see me doing my work</i>
<i>like I'm happy
to see them doing theirs.</i>
You see an opportunity,
just seize it.
Like Eminem say,
you only got one time.
Don't miss your opportunity.
We're going on another
long trip,
another long voyage.
Hope y'all end up
riding with us.
Look like it's going to be
a little drier today, though.
<i>Talking about love</i>
<i>God-given love, God-given love</i>
<i>I also have a number
that's a blues number.</i>
<i>Would you like to hear it?</i>
<i>You just play some, like...</i>
Yeah, some Muddy Waters.
Yeah, just like that.
<i>All right, but here's
the fun part of the bit,</i>
<i>is everybody can
sing a verse.</i>
<i>I woke up this mornin'</i>
<i>About quarter of four</i>
<i>Went back to sleep</i>
<i>Then I woke up at 8:00</i>
<i>Went back to sleep again</i>
<i>Then I woke up at 2:00</i>
<i>'Cause I'm a comedian</i>
<i>And I ain't got shit to do</i>
<i>Oh, yeah, baby</i>
<i>And then it goes down.</i>
<i>I've got them comedy blues</i>
<i>Come on. Give me some
of those horns, man.</i>

<i>In the real world,
we just people with ideas</i>
<i>They just like me and you

<i>Out in the real world,

My word of advice to you
is just relax</i>
<i>Just do what you got to do</i>
