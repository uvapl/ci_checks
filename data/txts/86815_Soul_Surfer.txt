BETHANY: I was born in Hawaii
to two die-hard surfers.
How could I not have
salt water in my veins?
They say home is
where the heart is.
And for most people, that consists
of four walls and a welcome mat.
But for me, it's the ocean.
With the warmth
of the sun on my skin.
(EXCLAIMING)
"Two brothers."
That's my answer when anyone
asks me why I'm so competitive.
(LAUGHING)
And, of course,
there's my best friend Alana.
(GIGGLING)
Trick or treat!
Trick or treat!
(SINGING HELE ON TO KAUAI)
We spent more time wet
than we did dry.
My mom was convinced
that we were mermaids.
From the moment
I caught my first wave,
I knew that I wanted
to be a pro surfer.
Nothing else seemed to matter.
Surfing is my passion,
my way of life.
The stoke I get from riding
a perfect wave is pure joy.
But like my dad always says,
"Life is an adventure.
"And sometimes, you wipe out and
end up in the impact zone."
Bethany!
Bethany!
Let's go, you're lagging!
I'm coming!
Hey, sorry, Noah,
I lost track of time!
(CHOIR SINGING HYMNS)
Glad you could join us.
Move over, Timmy.
Sorry, this seat's saved.
Come on.
Ow!
How were the waves?
Really fun.
Ready for the contest?
Yeah.
Practice your snap off the lip?
Shh.
No, but she's perfect
on the wipeouts.
Shh, guys, we're in church.
She's going to do
her mermaid thing
and crush it like
she always does.
(ALL SINGING)
(SINGING)
(SINGING)
(GIGGLES)
NOAH: Almost got it.
Darn it.
Come on.
Interesting technique, Noah.
Is that how the professionals do it?
Hey, I know what I'm doing.
Okay.
Where you going?
To watch the competition.
(EXCLAIMING JUBILANTLY)
Whoa!
(EXCLAIMING)
(ALL WHOOPING)
(ALL WHOOPING)
(CHEERING)
They gave me a five!
Not so bad for a girl.
(WHOOPING) Oh!
(CHEERING)
What!
Read it and weep, honey.
I'm not the one who's
going to be weeping.
Five!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Don't harass the judges!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
We're coming to get you!
(LAUGHING)
(GROANING)
Babe, is it your knee again?
Got you!
(BARKING)
(ALL SQUEALING)
(SCREAMS) Noah, put me down!
ANNOUNCER: Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to the junior portion
of the Maui Jim Turtle Bay
Resort Invitational.
We're expecting
a great competition today.
We've got skateboarding
on the half-pipe.
We've got all the action
in the water.
Watch top amateur surf...
Hey, howzit?
Hey.
Hey, Keoki.
If you get tired waiting
for the waves out there,
you can always come
and kick it with us.
We don't have to
wait for the action.
Well, when you get tired of the
pipe, come surf some real waves.
Ooh!
Hey, Thursday night
is a full moon.
If you guys aren't doing anything,
we're all gonna go surfing.
Yeah, if we don't have
anything better to do.
Okay.
See you guys later.
All right. Bye.
Bye.
ANNOUNCER: In semi-final heat number
one, we've got six competitors.
In orange is Olivia Jenner.
In black, Malina Birch.
In blue, Bethany Hamilton.
In yellow, Kaila Kahani.
In white, Lalani Bri.
And in pink, Alana Blanchard.
(CHEERING)
And it looks like the local groms have
tracked down Hawaiian surfing legend,
Ben Aipa.
Yeah, Ben!
Hey, you see that
sick air Keoki just got?
I don't think so.
What?
You're not going
to distract me.
I'm catching that next wave.
I don't think they know
how not to compete.
Holt, you didn't
tell them, did you?
No, no. I didn't want
to make them nervous.
I'm nervous enough for the
both of them, as it is.
You know, they both
have to place.
ANNOUNCER: Black, Malina
Birch, you're in first.
Blue, Bethany Hamilton,
you're in second
looking for a 4.2
to overtake that top spot.
Pink, Alana Blanchard,
you're in third,
requiring a 5.4 to
overtake first place.
Just a reminder,
ladies and gentlemen.
The winners of today's
contest will qualify
for the Hawaiian
Island Regionals.
Alana Blanchard finds the
cover to finish things off.
Solid wave for pink.
Yes!
Looks like we have
a paddle-battle here.
Go, Bethany! Go!
It's blue and black scratching
for a solid set wave.
Malina Birch taking the inside
off of Bethany Hamilton.
Here she is, up and riding.
Malina Birch kicks things
off with a very nice ride.
And a strong carve off the top.
She definitely knows what
the judges are looking for.
That will be a solid
wave for black.
Malina full on stole my
wave, I had position.
It's okay, it's all right.
Look, next time, I want you to really focus
on just diving into the
water as far as you can.
Rip that paddle
back. Okay?
Okay.
All right, take a rest.
You thirsty?
Yeah.
ANNOUNCER: With five minutes
remaining in this final,
pink, Alana Blanchard,
you are in first.
Black, Malina Birch,
you are in second.
And blue, Bethany Hamilton,
you are currently in third.
You're not breathing,
you know that, right?
Go! Go!
Yeah!
ANNOUNCER:
Big snap off the top.
She draws out
her second bottom turn,
and hooks it one more time.
Bethany Hamilton
is holding nothing back.
Potentially one of the highest
scoring rides of the day.
As this final comes to a
close here at Turtle Bay.
(CROWD CHEERING) Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
You're doing a great job
training her, Brother Tom.
Thanks, Ben.
You got it, bro.
Looks like she has
a real future.
As a pro.
She's been working so hard.
Well, with her heart,
her will, she'll go far.
ANNOUNCER: Third place of the Turtle Bay
Juniors final goes to Alana Blanchard.
(CHEERING)
In second place, Malina Birch.
Good job, Malina.
Meaning, taking first place
is Kauai's Bethany Hamilton.
Bethany!
With today's big victory,
Bethany Hamilton has to be
considered the favorite
as we head to the
Hawaiian Island Regionals.
(APPLAUSE)
(WHOOPS)
Way to go, Bethany.
Girls, there's some people down
there you might want to meet.
Who?
It's the guys from Rip
Curl, it's no big deal.
They want to sponsor
both of you.
No way!
What!
BOY: Oh, my gosh!
(SQUEALING EXCITEDLY)
(GIGGLING)
I got it, how about this one?
Nice, if you're 100.
Okay.
What about this?
Are you kidding?
Thing looks like a eye patch.
(MIMICS PIRATE SNARLING)
I think it's hot.
One wipeout in that tiny thing,
and you're going to be showing a
lot more than your sick rides.
Ooh, so much for so little.
Well, good thing
it's on Rip Curl.
Yes!
(BOTH GIGGLE)
ALANA: But make sure
to keep your eye on it,
if you don't want it snaked
out from underneath you.
Hey, girls.
You realize I'm gonna take
you next time, right?
Let's just let the
surfing do the talking.
Every day between
now and regionals,
when I'm in the water training,
I'll be thinking
of you, Hamilton.
Creepy.
Thanks, but I think you should
stick to your training.
Seems like you could
use a little focus.
I guess we'll find out.
Good seeing you again.
(LAUGHS)
You guys are usually the first
ones in here, let's go.
SARAH: Let's finish up
Rad Night with a game.
Can anyone tell me what
he or she thinks this is?
Easy, it's a dodge ball.
No.
Or Mars?
Mmm-mmm.
A blob in a lava lamp?
(ALL LAUGH)
Very creative, but no.
It's a fly's eye.
BOY: Weird.
GIRL: Ew!
How about this one?
BYRON: A brain.
Aren't brains
supposed to be pink?
A dead, rotting brain?
That is gross,
and that is a walnut.
So, you see how hard it can
be to make sense of things
when you're looking
at them really close?
The same thing's true in life.
So, if you guys are
dealing with anything,
that's just too hard to handle
or doesn't seem
to make much sense,
get a new perspective.
I want to share
with you guys something
that has really made
an impact on my life.
That's Jeremiah 29:11.
"For I know the plans that I
have for you," says the Lord.
"Plans to prosper you
and not to harm you.
"Plans to give you
hope and a future."
That's all the time
we have tonight, guys.
If you are going
on the mission trip,
please don't forget to give
me your permission slips.
Hey, what's up?
What's this?
Well, it looks like I'm not going
to be able to go to Mexico,
so I brought some things
for the orphanage.
I made the bracelets.
Noah donated the shoes
and the Spam's from Timmy.
Are you sure you can't come?
Yeah, I've got to stay and
train now that I'm sponsored.
I was really
looking forward to it.
You're going to miss out.
Well, have a good trip.
Sarah's really bumming me out.
Any particular reason?
Yeah.
So, I told her I'm not
coming to Mexico.
I mean, she knows that I have
two important competitions
coming up, right?
I mean, she knows how much
I've put into this, you know?
How much you and the whole
family has put into this.
So what's her angle?
That going to
Mexico to help kids
is really important.
And I know it is.
I mean, I really, really wish I could go.
It's just,
I've got to stay and
train for regionals.
Did you say you'd go?
Well, yeah, but that was
before I got sponsored.
I mean, it's like
she's counting on me now,
like I'm the only person in the
entire world who can do this.
I mean, I'm not going.
I mean, I can't, right?
It's your call.
(SIGHS) Great.
Now I feel even worse.
That's good.
A small step in a good direction.
The girls are all tucked in.
How's it look tomorrow?
Pretty decent, actually.
Well.
No, no, no, you can't.
What?
You have your surgery tomorrow.
The doctor said
no food after 10:00.
This is like juice.
Give it to me.
(CHUCKLING) No. No, no.
Give it.
No.
Give it. Give it.
No.
ALANA: You need to relax, they'll
never know the difference.
Maybe we shouldn't.
I mean, we have to get up
super early for dawn patrol.
I mean, what happens
if my mom comes in?
Bethany, it'll be worth it.
The moon's full.
The waves are perfect.
I mean, come on, it's almost Halloween.
Even Noah's done it.
He has?
Yeah.
I really wanted to go.
Shh! Okay,
come on, let's go.
(ALL WHOOPING)
(EXCLAIMING)
(GIRLS GIGGLING)
ALANA: Keoki.
I knew it was you!
KEOKI: No way!
Yeah, you surf like a skater.
Hey! (GIGGLES)
(BOTH SCREAMING)
You're toast, Keoki.
Whoa!
Okay, truce. Truce.
Okay, deal.
Bethy, it's almost midnight.
What happens at midnight?
You'll see.
What?
Later skater.
(WHOOPING)
(ALL CHEERING)
How lucky are we?
BETHANY: Awesome!
(EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY)
(WHIRRING)
Good morning.
Morning.
Morning.
So, as soon as you girls
get back from the water,
I've got an English
assignment all ready for you.
But it's a holiday.
It's Halloween.
We were thinking
that we could have
a couple extra hours
on the waves today?
'Cause you didn't get
enough last night?
Just say the word and we can
enroll you girls in Kapa'a,
where you can ride the bus
for 45 minutes each way
and do eight hours of straight
work during prime surf hours.
'Cause I'm all right with that.
Actually, I love home school.
Me, too.
Adore, totally.
I'm really sorry, Mom.
It's just...
I really, really wanted
to go night surfing.
I mean, everyone talks
about how awesome it is.
I mean, even Noah's done it.
He has?
Good job.
Why didn't you just ask?
Because she knew you'd say no.
How do you know I'd say no?
Would you have let me go?
No. I don't know.
Hey, no, no, no, no.
I promise I'll ask
next time, okay?
I'm going to hold you to that.
Dad, you should have them
upgrade you to a bionic knee
so you can actually
beat Mom in surfing.
It's going to take a lot
more than a bionic knee.
You just wait.
You sure you don't
want me to drive you?
Mom, I got it.
When you come through it,
I will be waiting.
(HORN HONKING)
That's your dad, Alana.
Have fun girls.
ALANA: Bye.
Bye, Dad. Say hi to
Dr. Rovinsky for me.
Have a good surgery,
I'll be praying.
Rip it up. See you
on the flip side.
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)
This is a good one.
This is a good song.
Oh, that looks good,
doesn't it?
All right, we're here.
Let's hit it.
Let's get out.
Let's do it.
Sweet. I've got
a meeting at 10:00,
so we don't have
a lot of time today.
No problem.
Just pick us up after your meeting.
Yeah. Like that's
going to happen.
Let's just get in
the water already.
(WHOOPING) HOLT: Come on, it's
a long paddle around the reef.
BETHANY:
Try and keep up with us.
Well, the anesthetic should
have started working by now.
You feel anything?
A little bit.
All right, it will
kick in shortly.
We'll have you back out there shredding
waves with Bethany in no time.
Thanks, David.
Yeah!
Whoa! Whoo!
Did you see that one?
That was nice
off the lip, buddy.
Thanks.
I wonder what bathing suit
I should wear to the shoot.
The pink's cute, but the black
really works with my tan.
I don't think
you get to decide.
They'll probably just
tell us what to wear.
I guess, but it's fun
to think about.
Can you believe we get to
come out here every day?
Yeah.
(SCREAMING)
ALANA: Dad!
Alana!
ALANA: Shark!
I need to get to the beach.
Oh, God!
BYRON: Dad,
where's the shark at?
We need to get to the reef!
Just get to the reef.
Keep on the board,
keep on the board.
Byron, you get to shore!
Go! Go! Call 911!
It's going to be okay, Beth.
I'll start it for you!
Come on. Ready, pal? Let's go.
Push, push, push.
(GRUNTING)
HOLT: Stay with us, sweetie, okay?
Stay with us.
Please, Jesus. Please...
Alana, you keep her on the board.
Okay.
On the board.
Please get me to the beach.
Please.
You're going to be okay!
(BYRON PANTING)
Come on!
(DIALING)
All right, here we go.
Doctor Rovinsky,
we need this room stat!
It's a teenage girl from the North Shore.
Shark attack.
Who? Who is it?
I'll check it out, Tom.
I'll check it out.
HOLT: Stay with me,
Bethany!
(RETCHING)
Alana! Get over here!
ALANA: (CRYING) I can't.
Morning, Mom.
When did you go night surfing?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Uh...
Night surfing...
All right.
All right, sweetheart.
Ambulance is coming, all right?
I want my mom.
I know. We're gonna get your mom.
We're gonna get your mom.
Wait, wait, wait. What?
Mom?
Dad! I called 911!
I called her mom.
Okay, okay, okay.
Grab the foot
of the board. Okay?
Grab it, on the count of three.
Ready? One, two, three!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Take her up to the truck!
Let's get her up there right now!
Come on. Talk to me.
(GRUNTING)
(ALANA CRYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Watch your step right here!
What your step right there!
(DISTORTED VOICES)
Where's the ambulance, Dad?
They're not here yet!
Don't worry about the ambulance!
We'll meet it on the way!
BYRON: Alana,
get the board!
Get her up! All right.
Get up, get up there!
Bethany, can you hear me?
Oh, my God.
She's losing
a lot of blood, Dad!
(SIREN WAILING)
All right, I see the ambulance.
Here it comes!
(HONKING)
(TIRES SCREECH)
Who are you, sir?
Family friend.
Do you know if she hit her head
or ever lost consciousness?
No, she never passed out, but
she's lost a lot of blood.
Here we go!
Careful! Easy.
Okay, lock her in.
Please don't die.
Come on, come on,
come on, sweetie.
(SIREN WAILING)
(SHUDDERING)
Please don't take her!
Please don't take her.
Please don't take her.
Tom, it's Bethany.
No, no! No!
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here! No.
Come on. You can't move!
Just let me get out of here!
You can't walk!
Get me out of here!
No!
(SIREN WAILING)
Talk to me. Gotta stay with me.
Keep looking at my eyes, okay?
Where's my family?
They're on their way.
They're gonna meet us at the hospital.
She's going into
hypovolemic shock.
(MONITOR BLEEPING)
We're almost there.
Breathe deep.
Mom, the car!
Stay with me.
Cheri, it happened so fast...
PARAMEDIC: Traumatic amputation.
Severe loss of blood.
CHERI: I'm here, baby,
I'm right here.
Blood pressure 70 over 40 and dropping.
I'm right here.
DOCTOR: Up, up!
Get her in here. Move!
Come on!
Follow it back.
Let's go!
Stay with us!
NOAH: Hang in there.
Bethany, you'll be okay!
CHERI: What's happening?
(VOICES DISTORTING)
Get her in a bed.
NURSE:
Move her into bay three!
PARAMEDIC: Come on, Bethany.
Stay with us, stay with us.
CHERI: What's happening?
NURSE: Bethany!
(INAUDIBLE)
(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)
Mom?
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm right here.
TOM: Hey.
We're all here.
It hurts.
Okay.
Noah, get the doctor.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm a little thirsty.
Okay.
Got it.
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Dad, please don't cry.
(CRYING)
I'm not crying.
I'm going to be okay.
I know.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hey there, kiddo.
How you holding up?
Pretty good, thanks to you.
I guess I ruined
your surf shirt, huh?
Well, I never liked
that one anyway.
Why don't you just concentrate
on getting better, okay?
Thank you.
You were amazing out there.
You were the one
who kept me calm.
You never...
You never let go.
You are incredibly
brave, Bethany.
Where's Alana?
She's... She's at home.
With her mother.
She's...
She's still
a little freaked out.
But, you know, she'll be better
knowing that you're
going to be okay.
So...
DR. ROVINSKY: Hey.
How's my favorite patient?
BETHANY: You say
that to everyone.
I mean it when I see you.
I'll wait outside.
I'll see you later.
So, I understand you're
feeling some discomfort.
Yeah.
Well, that's normal.
There's going to be a lot of pain
because of the trauma that you endured.
Not to mention the fact that you've
lost over 60% of your blood.
You're going to be feeling kind of
lousy for the next few days, kid.
Now here's the thing, Bethany.
The things that you're going to have to
learn to do differently is extensive.
But the good news.
Those things you're not
gonna be able to do
is small.
I'm so proud of you.
I'll tell you something.
She is a living miracle.
Thanks, David.
Hey, sleepy head.
Hi.
How you feeling?
I've been better.
When can I surf again?
Are you busy right now?
Kind of.
Soon.
How do you know?
Because you can
do all things...
Through him who
gives me strength.
...through him who
gives me strength.
Noah, eat your food.
It's gross.
I'm not hungry.
Eat it. Mine's fine.
I said, I'm not hungry.
Well, if you didn't want it, why'd
you let me pay for it then?
Fine.
I'll pay you back.
I think you two
should calm down.
I am calm.
We're not doing this.
NOAH: Doing what?
Life's got to go on
the way it's always gone on.
What you talking about?
Life is not going to go on the
way it has always gone on.
Will you stop arguing?
No, he's arguing with me.
TIMMY: Everyone's
yelling at everyone.
TOM: Stop it.
Stop it!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(SCREAMS)
Hey, sweetheart. It's a dream, okay?
Just a dream, that's all.
Just a dream.
(SOBBING) It wasn't a dream!
It was real.
(SOBBING)
You should go see her.
You know that?
You need to go see her.
...was resting on her surfboard
in the ocean off Hawaii,
when, suddenly,
a shark bites off her arm.
The girl doesn't even scream, and her
composure may have saved her life.
(SWITCHES OFF TV) You're
pretty much on every channel.
Hey!
Where have you been?
You know, at home,
living it up.
How have you been?
(TEARFULLY) I thought you
were going to die out there.
So, are you still going to do
that Rip Curl photo shoot?
They wanted me to.
But I told them I couldn't
do it without you.
But that's crazy.
You've been nuts for that shoot.
You have to do it.
Really?
Yeah. Of course.
Do it for both of us.
CHERI: You're not going to believe
how great the house smells.
Plants are everywhere.
More flowers
have been delivered
than there are growing
on the entire island.
Dr. Rovinsky said
that I can get back
in the water as soon
as my stitches come out.
Can we try a shower first?
That's so cool.
Who did that?
Everybody.
The bite on Bethany
Hamilton's surfboard
was 16 inches long
and 8 inches wide.
...currently searching for a
shark believed to be responsible
for the attack on
Bethany Hamilton.
CHERI: It's okay.
(HONKING)
NOAH: Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Get out of here!
BETHANY: Where's Dad?
Bethany!
(CLAMORING)
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
I said leave!
Noah! Noah!
Just get back in the house.
Dad...
Unlock the back door.
Bethany, is this...
Come on, get out of my way!
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Excuse me! Excuse me.
I've got it from here,
honey. Scoot over.
What are you gonna do?
Nice driving, 007.
You know what?
I never liked those bushes anyway, Dad.
NOAH: Come on, Bethany,
I got you.
Give me your bag.
I didn't know you could drive like that.
Neither did I.
So what do we do now?
Remember when we brought
Noah home from the hospital?
He was our first baby and
we had no clue what to do.
It's the same thing.
We'll take it day by day.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
That's so messed up.
I wish they would go away.
(GINGER BARKING)
Ginger! Hi, girl!
Oh!
I know, I know, I know.
I know. It's still me.
Ginger!
(LAUGHS)
Who's up for sandwiches?
Sounds so good, I'm starving.
CHERI: Noah?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, where's my Spam?
Mexico.
All of it?
CHERI: I got it.
I got it, sweetie.
Sorry, Mom.
It's okay.
Here, let me grab that.
You want to get
some bread, love?
Yeah.
Um...
I need to go unpack.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh.
(STRUMMING)
TOM: I have some
good news to share.
What news?
Holt got a call from that
show, Inside Edition,
and they want to give
Bethany a prosthetic arm.
Wait, wait, wait.
She's been home for five minutes.
They're gonna pay
for the entire thing.
When did you talk to a TV show?
And it's custom made.
Will it look normal?
I would think so.
Awesome.
Can they make one
I can surf with?
What does she have to do?
All she has to do is give a brief
interview, wearing the arm.
Check out my sister
the celebrity.
You don't have to do this.
No. I want to.
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
So, it's settled.
Hey, wait.
Let's give thanks.
BETHANY: That arm could
not come soon enough.
Because trying to
make do with only one,
even harder than it sounds.
I mean, fixing your hair is
not exactly rocket science.
Unless you've only got one arm.
Then it might as well
be a mission to Mars.
Every day of my life, for as
far back as I could remember,
I was in the water.
And now, I couldn't even
put my bathing suit on.
Almost everything
seemed to be a challenge.
But what scared me most, was that I
might not be able to surf again.
(WHISPERING) It's so sad.
Mommy, what happened
to that girl's arm?
I'm sorry.
CHERI: Should I go?
Or do you want to do this together?
It's up to you.
Stay.
Okay.
Oh, it's looking great.
It's healing nicely.
You all right?
There you go.
It's going to look better
once the stitches are out.
(DOOR SHUTS)
(SIGHING)
Is she okay?
You okay?
(CRYING)
Hey! I just got
back from Mexico.
I'm so glad you're okay.
I was just about
to come see you.
I couldn't wait.
Come here.
I was thinking about you, and
praying for you every minute.
How are you?
Oh...
I'm good. Yeah.
Everyone's been doing really good.
You don't have to
do that, Bethany.
Not with me.
(SIGHING) Um...
They're trying
to help. I know.
I know.
But...
But what?
You know how you said it's hard
to see things clearly sometimes
when you're too close?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I've been trying
to get some perspective.
I've been really trying.
(SOBBING)
Sarah, how can this be
God's plan for me?
I don't understand.
(SOBBING)
I don't know why terrible
things happen to us sometimes.
But I have to believe that something
good is going to come out of this.
Okay.
I don't know what that is.
I really wish I did.
Come here.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Dad.
Excuse us.
That's a perfect fit, bro.
TIMMY:
Come on, Dad.
Hey, Alana, can you take
a little half step forward?
Put your hand a little
higher on the board.
That is gorgeous.
Perfect.
Beautiful.
You're natural born
for this. Gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.
(BOYS WHOOPING)
PHOTOGRAPHER: Actually, Alana,
go take a break, come back,
grab a new bikini,
that'd be perfect.
So? How did I look?
Great.
Not too cheesy, right?
Uh...
Somewhere between cheddar
and jalapeno jack.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
Thank you.
That guy's ripping
it up out there, yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, Alana, we're ready
for you over here!
You know, you should
be doing this with me.
No.
You should.
Go on, they're waiting for you.
(EXCLAIMS IN FRUSTRATION)
Don't worry about me.
She's right,
you should listen to her.
Yeah, and you should
stop listening
to other people's
conversations, you kook.
Just got your back.
Loser.
Poser.
You should be out there
with her, though.
Yeah, I should be with her.
Just not there.
TIMMY: What's
taking so long?
NOAH: So what's
for breakfast?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Yeah, we would.
We're hungry! Yes!
(BLOWS)
Mmm.
(MIMICKING FANFARE)
Okay.
What's the occasion?
Does there have to be an occasion
for me to make my family
fresh squeezed orange juice
and homemade banana bread?
You do realize that tomorrow is
Thanksgiving, not today, right?
Yeah. That's why
it's the perfect time.
Perfect time for what?
To get back in the water.
Aren't you afraid?
I'm more afraid of not surfing.
All right, get out there and
have some fun! (WHOOPS)
Come on.
Come on, let's go already!
Are you ready?
If she is, I am.
Grab my ankle,
I'll tow you out.
No, I'm good.
There you go!
Just take it nice
and easy, Bethany.
Hey, don't worry about it.
It was a junk wave anyway.
Yeah, I'll get the next one.
Ooh!
(COUGHING)
CHERI: Why don't you
just paddle today?
No.
We can come back tomorrow.
No, I'm good.
Try putting your hand in
the center of the board,
along the stringer
so you don't tip over.
(COUGHING)
Be patient, honey.
Yes!
(WHOOPING)
Look at that!
Yeah!
(ALL WHOOPING)
(LAUGHING) Yeah!
(CHEERING)
(SCREAMING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Yeah!
That's the way to go, honey!
Got it all on camera.
Training starts tomorrow.
Training for what?
The Hawaiian Island Regionals.
(UPBEAT HAWAIIAN
MUSIC PLAYING)
(INAUDIBLE)
TOM: Excuse me!
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
ALL: Happy Thanksgiving!
Thanks so much for coming.
And if you don't mind, I'd like
to offer up a little toast.
Sweetheart.
We are so blessed and thankful
to God for all of you
because of your love
and your support
over the past few weeks.
And we are especially thankful to be
spending yet another Thanksgiving
with our sweet,
beloved daughter.
Here's to Bethany!
ALL: To Bethany!
(ALL CHEERING)
That was embarrassing.
I thought it was wonderful.
Hey!
Hey!
I heard you're
back in the water.
I know, and there's
something else.
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.
I'm surfing the Hawaiian
Island Regionals.
Are you kidding me?
No!
Oh, my gosh, that's so amazing!
Bethany, I am so proud of you!
Thanks.
Well, you really outdid yourself
again this year, Cheri.
I helped.
He tasted everything.
Yeah, one of my many talents.
Like clearing the table.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
I realize this would be a very
different day without you.
You know, I just wish
I could have done more.
Our family is a family
because of you.
TODD: We have made this to
your exact specifications.
Doesn't it look real?
Yeah. That's kind of
weird how real it looks.
And you can even
paint the fingernails.
Shall we try it on?
Now, you just take that strap,
and I'll take this one.
(BARKING)
Hold tight.
There, how does that feel?
It's okay.
(SNAPS)
(BARKS)
Let me just see how
it works on my board.
Not weight bearing.
How am I supposed to use
it to push up on my board?
I think you might have to
do that with the other arm.
So, is there a way I can
grab the rails to duck dive?
Honey, why don't you
just give it a chance?
How am I supposed to paddle
and surf in this thing?
I mean, look at it!
Yeah.
TODD: Because the remainder
of your arm is so short,
mobility will be limited.
But there's so much
more you can do...
Can I take it off, please?
TODD: Every single thing...
CHERI: Take it off.
She said she wants you to take it off.
You can turn that off.
(BARKING)
Hey! No! Hey!
Don't! Hey! Drop it!
Ginger!
TIMMY: Drop it! Ginger, stop!
Drop it!
TIMMY: No. Release!
Honey, you can still
surf without it.
TIMMY: Let it go!
NOAH: Ginger!
Bad dog!
Ginger!
Bad dog!
CHERI: I like her
better that way.
Dad was right.
I don't need it to surf.
No, you don't.
Would it be better to
just say it out loud?
I thought...
I thought at least with clothes
on, I could have two arms.
Thought I could look normal.
Normal is so overrated.
But people like normal, Mom.
Who?
Guys do.
(INHALING SHARPLY)
I mean, who will even
like me with this?
The right guy will love you
exactly the way you are.
Because you're beautiful.
How do you know?
Because I know.
What's that worth,
right? Nothing.
(SIGHS)
What are you doing?
We had this statue in my house,
when I was a little girl.
It was a replica from a museum
my parents once went to.
I didn't even think
about it until just now.
BETHANY: Venus de Milo.
For centuries,
all around the world,
she was considered
the pinnacle of beauty.
And she has one
less arm than you.
Yeah, but I can surf.
(GRUNTS)
So, regionals.
What we have to do is
to get you from here
to here.
It's not going to be easy.
I don't need easy,
I just need possible.
With you, anything's possible.
Let's do it.
(INAUDIBLE)
Right there.
On the take off.
Right there. Now, look.
A little back step.
Yeah.
That could be a sign...
'Cause that time I wiped out.
Just a hair late
when you take off.
So, I'll just adjust my body so
that my weight is even more...
Or bring your arm all
the way around. Yes.
(INAUDIBLE)
Look at her. That's it.
That's it, right there!
That is perfect.
Okay.
That's what you want to
go for every time. Yup.
How'd you feel out
there this morning?
Pretty good. I mean, I have a little
trouble getting under the big waves,
but once I'm up, I'm solid.
I'll come in if I can't
handle it, okay?
(SPEAKING HAWAIIAN)
Good morning.
I'm Piper Borraow.
And I'm Rob Bucannan.
And we'd like to welcome you to
the Hawaiian Island Regionals.
How do you feel?
Like barfing.
Yeah, well, aim for Malina.
If you don't want to do
this, you don't have to.
I'm not going to pull out now.
Besides everyone
knows I've entered.
It's now or never.
Soledad O'Brian is
in Phuket, Thailand.
She has been following
efforts by some survivors
to find their
missing loved ones.
Hey, Bethany. Good luck
out there today, yeah.
Thanks.
Man, that's really awful.
FEMALE REPORTER: Clearly, wherever you
look along the path of this tsunami
there is just stories of loss,
and thousands already...
I hope you guys get
a lot of donations.
Yeah, Sarah's organizing a trip
to help the kids in Thailand.
(HORN SOUNDING)
My heat's coming up,
I gotta go. Bye.
Great to have you
back, Bethany.
Thanks, it's good to be back.
So you're actually
going through with this?
Yeah.
MAN: Hey, Bethany.
BETHANY: Hey.
Judges have approved giving
you a five minute head start.
I don't want it.
Bethany.
I don't need it.
Okay.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Come on, Bethany.
PIPER:
First heat has started
and the girls are making their
way out into the lineup.
All right, we've got Bethany
Hamilton in the blue jersey
trying to catch her first wave.
(CHEERING)
See ya!
Bethany unable to
get into that wave.
Meanwhile, Malina Birch
scratches into one.
Looks like a good one.
ROB: All right,
Malina Birch dropped in
on that inside roll,
nice bottom turn.
Off the bottom, coming up.
Comes around the corner,
gets a nice vertical
off the top there
(CHEERING)
As she kicks out
to the challengers.
PIPER: Hamilton drops
into a nice looking wave.
(ALL CHEERING)
Ooh! A little loss
of control there.
But nice recovery.
She cuts back into the white water.
Should be a decent scoring
ride for the surfer in blue.
(CHEERING)
All right, Alana Blanchard,
drops into a wave of her own,
nice off the bottom,
big snap off the top.
Sets up again for a nice cut
back into the white water.
Speeding down the line
looking for a little tube
section, gets in there.
Threads that little
barrel and exits.
Nice wave for Alana Blanchard.
All right, Rockwell, it looks
like at the ten minute mark
we have Malina Birch in first
with a 7.3 on her first ride.
(PANTING) Alana Blanchard
is second with a 6.2.
And in third place,
Leila Hurst with a 5.3.
The surf is picking up.
Whoa, look at that outside,
a big set approaching.
It looks like Bethany Hamilton
is going to get caught
inside of the biggest
wave of the day.
Come on, Bethany.
Come on!
Mountains of water rolling
through here at Sunset Beach
and it looks like our competitor
in blue, Bethany Hamilton,
just taking some donuts out there.
(COUGHING)
No! I'm fine!
I knew she wouldn't come in.
Bethany, grab my leash, I'll pull
you the rest of the way out.
No, I'm fine.
I can do this!
Come on, Bethany!
PIPER: All right,
four minutes left,
and Bethany Hamilton still
stuck in the impact zone, Rob.
Bethany, in sixth
place, right now.
She's still needing
quite a score.
She's okay.
Malina, don't!
You have enough, let her have it!
ROB: Alana Blanchard just
dropped in on Malina Birch.
(GROANS)
That's definitely going to be an
interference call on Blanchard.
PIPER: Alana Blanchard will
not make it on this heat,
has been disqualified
for the interference.
(INDISTINCT)
(GASPING)
I can't take it anymore, I want
you to get her out of there.
I want her out of there.
The lifeguards are on it.
ROB: Oh, man, it looks
like she broke her board.
PIPER: Well, unfortunately
for Bethany Hamilton,
a broken board right now,
puts her in a bad position,
with only 3 minutes remaining,
there's no chance she's making
it out of this first heat.
You shouldn't have dropped
in on Malina like that.
She was trying...
She was just hassling me,
like she always does.
She's a jerk!
At least she was treating me
like I was real competition.
(CAMERAS CLICKING) Bethany,
what happened to you out there?
Bethany.
Can we please just
get out of here?
NOAH: Make a path!
Get out of the way!
(CLAMORING)
(CLAMORING CEASES)
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Stay calm. REPORTER: Bethany,
how are you feeling?
That's enough, come on.
(CHATTERING)
Bethany, I know
that you got beat up
pretty bad out there
today, sweetheart.
But you can't
let it get you down.
Enough, Dad, okay?
I can't do this anymore!
Yes, you can, honey.
Listen to her.
GIRL: Bethany!
Bethany! Bethany!
Hey, Bethany!
Can I get your autograph?
I have something
even better actually.
Here.
Cool!
Bethany, what are you doing?
GIRL: Oh, my God!
This is so cool!
Awesome, thanks!
Enjoy them.
Bethany.
Dad, just stop. Okay?
It's over.
CHERI: That's not
what I'm saying.
You can't give up on her.
And you can't keep
pushing at her.
What are you supposed to
do, just let her quit?
If she wants to, yes.
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.
Then you're not hearing
what I'm saying.
What? What is it
that I'm not hearing?
You can't always fix
everything by sheer will.
Sometimes there is no...
(INCREASES VOLUME)
ANNOUNCER: ...Hamilton has to
be considered the favorite
as we head to the
Hawaiian Island Regionals.
She's a surfer.
She's a competitor.
She's more than that.
Cheri, if she walks
away from this...
If she quits, she may never
get back in the water again.
And she will never be the same.
She will never be the same.
And if she thinks the only life
out there for her is surfing
and she can't make that happen
then she's going to be lost.
Really, really lost.
Go ahead, tell me how
everything's going to be okay.
Yeah, that's me. Mister
jump-right-in-and-fix-it.
If I could just keep
my mouth shut for once.
I'm done, aren't I?
I can't even paddle out to the
lineup past the big waves.
I don't understand.
What happened to
"I can do all things"?
Why?
Why did this happen?
Why did I have to
lose everything?
You didn't lose
everything, Bethany.
Not even close.
That shark didn't kill you.
You're still here.
You're still alive.
With a family that loves you.
What am I supposed to do now?
I don't know.
Then how am I supposed to know?
When the time is right,
you'll know.
Until then, you pray
and you listen.
Listen for what?
For what comes next.
SARAH: Okay, Lymar,
I hope you remembered
your toothbrush
this time. Okay?
Did you remember your socks?
Because you are not
borrowing mine again.
Could you pass these out?
Bethany?
Mind if I tag along?
I'm sure we can scrounge up
something for you to do.
Hey.
(BLEATING)
(CLUCKING)
All right, guys, let's go!
(ROSEMARY SHOUTING
INSTRUCTIONS IN FRENCH)
Rosemary!
Sarah!
Hey, thank you for coming.
This is Bethany.
Bethany, yeah, I've heard a lot about you.
I'm happy you're here.
Grab some bags
and pass them out.
All right,
everybody make a line.
Just grab it and pass it down.
Come on.
Keep it going!
Come on guys.
Keep going.
Make a line.
Got it?
Good job.
(CHATTERING IN THAI)
She wants to thank you all
for what you've been doing.
They're very grateful.
We're so happy we can help, we
know they've been through so much.
(ROSEMARY TRANSLATING IN THAI)
(WOMAN CHATTERING)
ROSEMARY: She says it was just
a normal day like any other.
But that they saw
the water roll back
and they went to get the
fish and the lobsters.
But then they saw the wave
and it was too late.
And the water just kept coming,
there weren't many survivors.
WOMAN: (CRYING)
I lost my family.
Another family,
they all died...
I'm so sad.
You okay?
Yeah.
It's all right, don't be sorry
for compassion, Bethany.
It can move us
to do amazing things.
And it can help you
get a new perspective.
Why don't you take a minute,
then when you're feeling
better, come back and join us.
'Cause there's
a lot to do. Okay?
Good.
(SNIFFLING)
BETHANY: Here you go.
(BETHANY SPEAKING IN THAI)
Hello.
Here you go.
How come no one's in the water?
We brought all these boards.
Still petrified.
Is it safe?
Yeah.
Oh! (CHUCKLES)
Something's missing, yeah?
They said he wandered up a
few days after the tsunami.
What's his name?
They don't know.
He hasn't said a word,
he won't even smile.
Hey, do you want
to go in the water?
Do you want to go out to
the ocean and go swimming?
No?
Hey, can I borrow your board?
Yeah.
BETHANY: Thank you.
Thanks.
(INAUDIBLE)
BETHANY: They say the Lord
works in mysterious ways.
I say that's an understatement.
Who would have thought
that teaching a kid to surf
would teach me
that surfing isn't
the most important
thing in the world?
And that something else is.
Love.
Bigger than any tidal wave.
More powerful than any fear.
(EXCITED CHATTERING)
Hey, I'm home!
Hey, there she is.
How was your trip?
BETHANY: Great.
What's all this stuff?
NOAH: Oh, you know,
just a little fan mail.
Went ahead and sorted
it out by country.
Are you serious?
Yup.
And apparently, you are
very popular in Madagascar.
No way.
"Dear Bethany.
My name is Stephanie Bolt,
"I'm 11 years old
and I go to Northcross
"Intermediate School
in New Zealand."
BETHANY:
People are so amazing.
There's an eighth grader from
North Carolina, who lost his arm.
Logan, and he says
he's gonna try out
for his school soccer
team because of me.
And he's rooting for me
in my next competition.
I mean, I don't understand,
I totally blew it at regionals.
Why would they
want me to compete?
You tried.
And apparently, Dylan and
Stephanie like that.
Hey, Dad.
I need your help.
Name it.
I think I want to compete.
You sure?
You don't have to.
I'll take it heat by heat.
Okay.
So we need to
figure out something.
Some way so when I duck
dive, I don't get pounded.
Yeah.
You mean something like this?
Yeah.
(CHEERING)
You sure she can
use it in competition?
Sure. Judges don't score on
how you get out to the waves.
They only care what you
do when you catch one.
Go ahead, say it.
(LAUGHING)
I'm a genius.
You are...
Come on, say it.
Tom, you're a genius!
Genius.
You're very smart.
Genius.
Come on, you know it.
You're cute. You're very cute.
Genius. Genius.
Hey.
Hey.
Remember me?
No.
That's really nice.
Best friends since birth, nothing.
No. Nothing.
Good. Good sign.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Hey, thanks for coming.
Thanks for calling.
I'm sorry I snapped
at you at regionals.
Me, too.
I miss you.
Me, too.
Friends?
Of course.
(LAUGHING)
(IT'S YOUR LIFE PLAYING)
(INAUDIBLE)
KEOKI: Hey, Bethany!
I saw you surfing out there this morning.
You were amazing.
Maybe for a girl with one arm.
By any standard.
As for one arm, that just
levels the playing field.
All right, all right.
What do you want?
I want you to dominate
at nationals.
Hey, Keoki, thanks.
For what?
Just for always showing up
for me, no matter what.
Well, it's because
I care about you.
I mean, even if you did miss
my last competition and all.
I was in the hospital
you psycho.
Excuses, excuses.
Ah! Ow!
Bethany, I'm sorry.
I wasn't even...
Gotcha.
BETHANY: Sucker!
Welcome to the Rip Curl Junior
Nationals Surfing Championship.
David Stanfield
along with Bo Hodge.
And, Bo, we have
an exciting day today.
BO: We've got an excellent
day of surfing on hand.
We're going to see the best amateur
surfers from around the country today.
DAVID: We have a panel of
four international judges
watching this
national championship.
High and low scores
are thrown out,
but what are the judges
exactly looking for?
Well, Dave,
we have 25-minute heats.
Each rider is allowed to catch a
maximum of 10 waves per heat.
The best two waves will be
tallied up for the final score.
What the judges
are looking for:
Style, flow and power and
control in radical maneuvers
in the most critical
sections of the wave.
Well, we have surf in the
six-to-eight-foot range,
it looks like out there.
What's key about
this six person heat
is in fact that paddling
and positioning, right?
These girls are tough, especially
Malina, you know that.
The surf is big
out there today,
so if you try to match
them wave for wave,
you're just doing to wear yourself
out with all that paddling.
Yeah.
So don't take just any
wave that comes along.
The greatest surfers, they
all have this sixth sense.
They know when the
best waves are coming.
They can feel it.
It's a gift.
You have that gift, too.
I do?
Well, your mom's right, honey.
You are a little mermaid.
You know that moment between
the sets when it's quiet
and the waves haven't
even formed yet,
it's just energy surging
through the water.
Well, that's the time
to be patient.
Listen to your instinct.
Trust it.
You'll know.
Go get 'em.
REPORTERS: Malina! Malina!
Over the past few months, Malina Birch
has dominated every heat she's surfed
winning three
contests in a row.
No one has come close.
She's by far the person to beat today.
(CLAMORING)
REPORTERS: Bethany! Bethany!
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Don't worry, it's all
part of being sponsored.
We love you, Bethany!
(WHOOPS)
I'm going to go
get the rash guards.
What are you doing here?
I'm surfing, same as you.
Well, I hope you don't
need to be rescued again.
Actually, Malina,
I wanted to thank you.
For what?
Just for never taking it easy on me.
It means a lot.
ALANA: You ready?
Okay.
DAVID: Bethany Hamilton's
appearance here
is truly a remarkable comeback.
Against all odds,
she has earned her spot
into the National
Championships.
Everyone in
attendance is hopeful
that Bethany has
a great contest.
But at the highest level of
competition, there are no free rides.
We begin with our first
round of competition.
(TOOTING)
And there's the horn.
The first heat is underway.
Yes!
(CHEERING)
Yes!
(WHOOPING)
(CHEERING)
Can you believe that?
(HORN SOUNDS)
DAVID: Advancing into the
finals by 2/10's of a point,
the big story is
Bethany Hamilton.
She was looking for a 7.2 and
scored a 7.4 on her last wave.
She'll be wearing blue
out in the lineup
with her good friend, wearing
pink, Alana Blanchard.
And their competitors,
black, Malina Birch.
Yellow, Leila Hurst. White, Nagé
Melamed, and in orange Kelia Moniz.
And the judges are looking for
some progressive surfing today.
BO: That's right, Dave.
They'll have a 25-minute heat,
be scored on 10 waves,
but they'll keep their best
two waves for the final score
on the zero to ten point range.
And there's the horn
and the heat is underway.
(APPLAUSE)
Yeah!
BO: There's Nagé Melamed.
She scores two vertical turns,
and the judges
give her a 6. 75,
and what a great
start to this heat.
DAVID: Alana Blanchard
picking up a set wave.
Works her way down the line.
Snaps a big turn off the top.
Runs around her competitor
with an aggressive reentry.
And pink cracks
the lip one more time.
Great run, Alana!
BO: Situation with fifteen
minutes remaining in the heat,
surfer in orange, Kelia
Moniz, you have a 5.4.
Surfer in white, Nagé
Melamed, you have a 6. 75.
Surfer in pink,
Alana Blanchard,
you are in first
place with a 7.0.
Way to go, Alana!
Go!
(ALL GROAN)
DAVID: Bo, Hamilton goes down hard in
the impact zone, and she is struggling.
That's okay.
You'll get another one!
Stay in there,
stay in there, Bethany.
DAVID: Take a look at this.
We've got four competitors
scratching for this wave.
And surfer in black
takes control of the peak.
BO: Birch on the
nice take off.
She sprays Bethany!
Great off the top!
(CHEERING)
Birch snaps under the lip.
Banks it off the white
water one more time.
Man, she is on fire today.
One away. Malina Birch has scored
a 9.25 according to the judges,
and that is a high score.
Now she is in the lead,
Blanchard in second.
Melamed in third,
Leila Hurst in fourth,
Bethany Hamilton is in fifth, and
in sixth right now is Moniz.
BO: Hamilton with a stall
and goes over the falls.
Is she going to be all right?
It's okay. Everybody gets
caught every once in a while.
She can handle it.
BO: Precious time on the
clock right now, Dave.
And it looks like Alana is paddling
into a big wave on the outside.
DAVID: Ooh! And Alana Blanchard
takes a spill there, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, Malina
Birch is up and riding again.
This girl's a wave
magnet today, Bo.
She certainly is in
rhythm with the ocean.
Way above the pack here
in today's competition.
Malina Birch has just scored
a 9.5 on her last wave.
That is the highest
wave of the contest.
She's going to need
two nine-plus waves
to even come close
to catching Malina.
She's got less
than five minutes.
DAVID: With time winding down
and no waves on the horizon,
our surfers are anxious
to get a final score.
Look for the girls to scramble for any
solid wave before the hooter blows.
Check this out,
ladies and gentlemen.
There's some
energy out in back.
Looks like the girls have spotted
something on the horizon.
Paddle, Bethany.
Paddle hard.
Bo, take a look at this.
Birch and Hamilton
paddle-battle out the back.
BO: And Hamilton really needs
to beat her to the inside.
If she's got
a chance here today.
Come on, Bethany,
stay ahead of her!
Don't let up!
You got her!
Unbelievable, Bo, all Malina's got
to do is block Bethany Hamilton
from getting to the inside and
she's got this contest in the bag.
(PANTING)
Paddle hard!
Birch is still blocking
Hamilton from the inside.
I don't know how she's going
to catch this wave, Bo.
Paddle!
Dave, we've got a
paddle-battle to the outside.
It's Birch.
It's Hamilton.
(YELLING)
She's got her on the ropes.
Can Bethany catch the wave?
This is her last chance.
Yes!
Yes!
She's got the wave, David!
This is the one she's been
waiting for all contest long.
Absolutely unbelievable.
Bethany Hamilton duck
dives under Malina Birch
while Birch is still out there
looking for another ride.
(CHEERING)
Sick one, Bethany!
(WHOOPING)
That was an unbelievable
ride by Bethany Hamilton.
(CHEERING)
(WHOOPING)
The judges
give her a 9. 7.
(CHEERING)
It's the highest
score of the heat!
Wow!
But she's still fifth!
All right, guys,
she needs one more, one more.
Bethany Hamilton is paddling
outside the lineup.
What does she see?
I don't know, Dave, but no
one's been paddling out
in that area
all during the contest.
Why is she so far out?
What, is she giving up?
I don't know.
She feels something.
What are you doing?
Dave, there's only one minute
remaining on the clock.
It is dead flat.
The contest
may be already over.
Why is she stopping?
There's nothing out there.
Not yet.
DAVID: Only 45 seconds on the clock
and no set waves on the horizon.
This contest may be over, Bo.
We are counting down
to end this final.
Just 30 seconds
left on the clock.
Big bomb on the outside.
BO: Fifteen seconds
remaining.
Everybody else
is too far inside.
DAVID: The Rip Curl Nationals,
10 seconds to go!
And there is Bethany Hamilton with
an amazing wave out the back.
Will this be enough?
She is paddling
and here comes the wave.
(SOUNDING)
She's taken the drop!
(CHEERING)
(APPLAUSE)
An amazing barrel for Bethany Hamilton.
Perfect positioning.
Was she up before the horn?
They have to count it.
(CHEERING)
Way to go, Bethany!
Yeah!
(SIGHS)
Unbelievable.
Bethany Hamilton's
amazing wave at the
end does not count.
She stood up after the horn.
ALL: What?
So she gets no score.
Malina Birch,
your new National Champion.
No!
It's okay, Dad.
It's okay.
But it didn't count.
It counted.
It totally counted.
Yes, it did.
I'm still checking
that video. Noah!
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Hey. You okay?
Very. Are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
What am I supposed to do now?
You're supposed to
enjoy it. All of it.
For the rest of your life.
(CHEERING)
DAVID: In fifth place, Bethany Hamilton!
Good job.
Yeah! Bethany!
And in fourth place,
Leila Hurst.
Third place, Nagé Melamed.
Second place, Alana Blanchard.
HOLT: Way to go, baby!
And in first place,
Malina Birch.
Hey.
Hey, Malina. Great job.
You're a tough opponent.
Bethany Hamilton,
nobody is as tough as you.
Get up here.
Come on. Come on.
I'd like to share this win
with Bethany Hamilton.
Because the judges may not
have counted that last wave,
but I did.
Bethany.
(CHEERING)
Bethany! Bethany!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just back off, okay.
It's okay.
Are you sure?
You don't have to talk to them.
Yeah, but what about Dylan
or Logan or Stephanie?
What if they're watching?
Bethany, I'm from
Transworld Surf magazine.
Are you upset
you didn't win today?
I didn't come to win.
I came to surf.
Bethany, I just
wanted to ask you
if you could go
back to that day
and not have gone surfing,
would you do it?
I wouldn't change
what happened to me,
because then I wouldn't have this
chance in front of all of you.
This chance to
embrace more people
than I ever could
have with two arms.
BETHANY: I was born to surf.
This is why I wake up at the
crack of dawn every day.
This is why I endure
belly rashes, reef cuts,
muscles so tired
they feel like noodles.
And I've learned that
life is a lot like surfing.
When you get caught in the impact
zone, you need to get right back up
because you never know
what's over the next wave.
And if you have faith,
anything is possible.
Anything at all.
(THE UNKNOWN PLAYING)
(CHEERING)
Yeah, it was so much
fun just seeing him
get better and better
on every wave
and get up and ride all the way to the beach.
It was awesome.
ANNOUNCER: Throwing out
the ceremonial first pitch
of the 2004 season
is Bethany Hamilton.
(CROWD ROARING)
Strike.
Thank you, Bethany!
I think I got my courage
from Jesus Christ.
He says, "Be strong."
You think you're
going to surf again?
I think?
I know I'm going to surf again.
(SET THE WORLD ON FIRE PLAYING)
