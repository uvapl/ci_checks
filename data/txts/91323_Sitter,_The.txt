(GIRL CONTINUES MOANING)
Oh, my God!
<i>Girl you make me feel real good</i>
NOAH: That's right.
What's up?
Oh, my God.
My mom was so right.
Nice guys really do eat the best pussy.
I'm not really sure how to
interpret that. Thank you?
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.
How are you so good at that?
I'll let you in on atrade secret.
I actually write ashort story
with my tongue every time I do it.
It follows this young kid
who finds this alien in the woods
with all these Reese's Pieces and stuff.
And he learns that
aliens are just no different.
You just can connect with anyone.
It's kind of like E. T.,
only with alot more going down on chicks.
-Cool beans.
-Yeah, cool beans.
-Definitely. Cool little frozen beans.
-Yeah.
All right, so...
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.
Yeah, we should...
-We should probably...
-Yeah, you should probably go.
...switch places.
What's that?
(LAUGHS)
-I figured...
-Don't you have to go?
No, no, I just figured
because I made "mouth love" to you
that maybe you could
(CLICKS TONGUE) return the favor.
-What?
-Maybe toss aBJ my way.
If you have time.
My stomach is super-iffy right now.
I think I got food poisoning.
Baby.
So I'm just in no condition
to blow you right now, Noah.
-No, yeah, that's cool.
-Okay.
Sorry. Next time, sweetie.
Are you sure you don't want
to come over tonight?
There's this thing called
ageomagnetic storm.
It's really cool and rare, actually.
It's like an astronomical explosion
in the sky of all these beautiful colors.
Whoa! (LAUGHS)
Kind of like Mother Nature's fireworks.
It happens, like, almost never.
Like I said, I'm just not feeling good.
But thank you so much
for going down on me.
Oh, yeah. You're really good at
getting going down on,
getting downed on,
-so you should be proud of that as well.
-Okay, cool. You daman!
You daman.
Peace. You're the best, sweetie.
Don't stop believing in yourself,
okay, Maris?

He owes us 10 years of alimony.
Oh, look, kiddo.
If you're looking for ahandout,
think again times 10.
That guy's adiamond dealer.
He has crazy cash.
Why'd you marry such an A-hole?
That A-hole gave me the greatest gift
in the world.
Crabs?
He gave me you.
-Okay.
-(LAUGHS)
So, tell me, what do you think?
-Do I look okay?
-You look amazing.
Why are you so concerned with your outfit?
Mrs. Pedullais introducing me to asurgeon

What?
Do I have shit on my face?
Come on.
Don't tell me you can't use the money.
Are you crazy? No. I'm not Mary Poppins.
I'm not gonnabe ababysitter.
I'm an adult man.
Okay? Babysitting sucks.
Adult men don't babysit things.
Oh, Noah, you're wonderful with children!
You know, never mind.
Who am I kidding?
Finding aguy at my age is ridiculous.
I'm going to change my dress. (EXHALES)

Oh, my gosh.
Get over... Bring it in for ahug, babe.
What are we doing?
God, I haven't see you since

You two are still together?
MRS. PEDULLA: Um...
Oh! That's my kind of TV, right there.

Hey, Slater?
Anyway, honey, this is Noah.
He's going to be babysitting tonight.
-What happened to Nancy?
-Honey, we talked about this.
Nancy has aurinary tract infection, okay?
Is Clayton coming over tonight?
No, Mom.
His tarantuladied from parasites,
and now he's in mourning.
Well, you're in luck, Noah.
The two of them together are just trouble.
Hey. That's not true.
Why do you say that?
You're always attacking us!
Honey, I am not attacking you.
Okay? Calm down.
(PHONE RINGING)
-You know what? I'll be right back.
-Yeah.
Okay? Excuse me just one second.
Hello?
NOAH: Hey, what are you watching?
-Just watching some gymnastics.
-Cool.
Hey, how old are you, man?
-Thirteen.
-Thirteen?
What am I doing here?
Why aren't you babysitting yourself?
-I'm not ababysitter, okay?
-Yeah, neither am I.
If you would just man up and babysit,
I wouldn't have to be here tonight.
I could be out having fun.
I have severe anxiety issues.
And my doctor, he says that I can't
handle any kind of responsibility,
-or else I could just snap...
-(SNAPS FINGERS)
...at any moment.
Jesus Christ, man. Relax.
Okay. Sorry.
NOAH: Slater, nice to meet you.
All right, should we go upstairs?
Bye, honey.
NOAH: We're gonnahave
some fun tonight, pal.
(RAPPING) Roll back nice and easy
<i>Keep your breath inside</i>

Honey! What did Mommy tell you
about the mascara? Put it down.
-You said I could play dress-up.
-Yeah, I said you could play dress-up,
not make yourself look like ahooker.
Look at you!
(LAUGHS) My daughter Blithe is going
through this whole "celebutante" phase.
It's kind of unfortunate, but it's afad.
That's what they do in the schools.
It'll pass.
I don't know where they come from.
-Kids, right?
-Yeah, kids.
Are you the babysitter?
Why, in fact, I am. I'm Noah.
-Noah. That's your name?
-Yeah.
That's asuper-hot name.
What?
Honey, it's not hot. It's just his name.
Mom, trust me. It's ahot name.
It's actually biblical.
The Bible's ahot book.
Sometimes I like to get dressed up
and wear my mom's makeup, Noah.
-That's cool.
-I was thinking
we could dress you up like aprincess.
-No, I don't think, uh... (LAUGHS)
-No, honey,
-maybe not tonight.
-SLATER: Mom!
-Excuse me just one second.
-Yeah, see you in asec.

You got it right in my mouth!
-Why'd you do that?
-(GIGGLING)
You just spit on my carpet!
And you just sprayed perfume

What's your problem?
My real babysitter, Nancy,
she plays with me when she babysits.
She does what I want her to do,
Princess Noah!
You know what?
(WHISPERING)
I'm gonnalet you in on alittle secret.
I'm not areal babysitter. (FAKE GASPS)
(WHISPERING) Shocking.
I'm more of asit-on-the-couch,
eat-a-burrito,
do-whatever-I-say-or-I'll-kill-you
type of babysitter.
That's my style, blood. You understand?
Well, I want to wear sparkly things,
shiny things, and glittery stuff
to my favorite hot nightclub, okay?
(MIMICKING)
-Motherfuck!
-You guys okay in here?

-So...
-DR. PEDULLA: In aminute.

NOAH: Cool.
Someone smells wonderful!
I believe that's Noah's mouth.
You remember Noah.
I understand you were cited recently
for driving under the influence.
Needless to say,

Tell me I'm imagining that
and that's not what I'm actually seeing.
I need it to carry my pills.
Why do you take those pills anyway?
-I already told you, I have issues.
-Issues?
You look like aGap model!
When I was your age,
I had amouth full of braces

Those are real issues, my man.
Whatever.
BLITHE: I've got agood idea.
Why don't we go to adance club?
Why don't we play agame?

Ready? Go.
(FARTING)
(GROANS) Come on, Rodrigo,

It was not me.
(GIGGLING)
Slater, that's disgusting.
Didn't your parents teach you
not to fart in the car?
You just crop-dusted me.
No, that was not me.
-Uh-oh.
-What's "uh-oh"?
It was me. I pooted.
I don't think it was just apoot-poot.
-I sharted.

-Can you get it for me?
Yeah! Of course.
I'll get you anything you want.

Clean up, or whatever.
-Can I help you, sir?
-Huh?
-Can I help you?
-I'm just waiting for somebody.
-(LAUGHS) Yeah.
-Yup!
(FAKE LAUGHING)
-No.
-I'm just waiting for somebody.
That's pretty weird,
considering you're agrown-ass man
hanging out
in the little girls' underwear section.
Right. I could see how that could be
misconstrued as strange, or whatever.
-Very.
-BLITHE: They fit. Let's go.
There we go. There she is.
Excuse me, young lady,
do you know this person?
-No.
-Yeah.
Which is it?
He came into my house
and stole my mom's minivan.
Now he's taking me and my brothers
to get some candy.
Okay, that sounds way, way worse
than it actually is.
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?
What? No, I'm the babysitter.
-What?
-He's not areal babysitter.
He's a"do-whatever-I-say-
or-I'll-kill-you type of babysitter."
What?
-That sounds way...
-That's what he said!
Blithe, shut the fuck up.
Do not tell her to shut up!
Thank you.
Ooh, shit! I remember you!
I went to high school with your ass!
You came to my house party one time,
got all wasted, and then
you puked in my grandmama's urn.
And when I asked you about it, you lied
and ran away like alittle biotch!
I didn't run away like alittle biotch!
I probablyjust ran like anormal person.
And now you're hanging out
in the little girls' clothes section.
Can you please lower your voice?
There are numerous misunderstandings.
No, no, no. I'm not buying none of this.
Come on, little girl.
-Let me go!
-I'm not buying it!
(CLAMORING)
You got some shit to deal with!
Security!
Why did you say that, Blithe?
You were trying
to make me buy green underwear.
Green underwear is not hot!
You're the worst babysitter ever!
(MIMICKING BLITHE)
"You're the worst babysitter ever!"
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)
You guys?
Where's Rodrigo?
I don't know. I guess he left.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
That's an incredible observation, Slater.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
I was talking to my friend Clayton.
-Which way did he go?
-I don't know!
(GPS TRACKER BEEPING)
Got you, you little bastard.

-May I help you, sir?
Yeah.
I'm looking for asmall Hispanic boy.
About 4'8", leatherjacket, pajamas,

-I eat your ear.
I bite it offwith my teeth,

That's very specific.
(SIGHING) All right. I've got to pick up
some candy for my girlfriend.
So you guys wait here and watch
little bin Laden back there, okay?
This isn't about getting candy, is it?
Lock the doors,

Don't move or talk to anybody
or look at anybody.

We're knocking down some walls

A little more elbow room.

Huh?
Why is that awesome?
More room for bodybuilders

(PHONE RINGING)
-Hello?
<i>-KARL: Noah Griffith!</i>
Hey!
Hey, Karl, what's up?
How did you get this number?
I got it off your Facebook page,
as I was trying to friend you
as you were walking out.
Anyway, as I was friending you,
Julio noticed that
maybe you stole
ababy dinosaur egg from me.
And it's just, like, I'm confused.
You know what I mean?
Because I'm thinking that we're friends,
and then all of asudden,
I don't know, it's like...
I really liked you, you know?
Karl, just relax, please.
I'm sorry, I don't have your drugs.
<i>The kid l'm babysitting,</i>
<i>he took one of your eggs,</i>
<i>and l was trying to get it back</i>
<i>and it accidentally splashed in my face.</i>
Fucking shut the fuck up.
<i>Unless l get my drugs back</i>
or my money back, I'm going to kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!
<i>l want you to meet me</i>
<i>at Wing's Fish Market.</i>
Where?
Wing's Fish Market. It's in Chinese Town.
<i>You meet me there in one hour</i>
<i>with my 10 grand, or you're dead meat.</i>
Okay. Thanks, bye.
I have to go pee-pee now.
You're holding it in this time, asshole.
It'll be all right.
I thought he was my friend.
It's all right.
BLITHE: Shut up!
SLATER: I wannago home.
-(SPEAKS SPANISH)
-I don't know what you're saying.
-Don't. Stop it!
-Stop! No!
-No, my lip gloss! Give it back!
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
What are you getting mad at us for?
Because Rodrigo here is athief,
and now I'm in deep shit.
And the worst part of all of this
is that I'm stuck here with you three.
You, you got more issues
than amagazine stand.
And, you, wipe the makeup off your face,
Picasso. What are you, amob wife?
And, you, you're the worst.
I know you're alittle kid, and I know I'm not
supposed to say this kind of stuff to you,
but fuck you.
Fuck you so much.
You're adouche.
Look, Noah, if you hate us that much,
then just drop us offwith our parents.
You know what? That's an amazing idea.
Let's go.
<i>l've seen the way you look at me</i>
<i>l know the things you say</i>
<i>when l'm not there</i>
<i>But when you're here alone with me</i>
<i>Baby, don't pretend that you don't care</i>
<i>Come on, let the feeling begin</i>
<i>Come on, baby</i>
<i>Come on, yeah</i>
<i>Don't stop when the feeling begins</i>
Come on. I've changed my mind.
I need to clean up my mess myself.
All right, ideas, ideas, ideas, ideas, ideas.
Okay. Slater, can you get off the phone?
I need an idea. You can text
your buddy Clayton later, okay?
BLITHE: Yeah, man, seriously!
SLATER: It's not Clayton. It's those twins,
and they want me to go to Prospect Hall
for Wendy Sapperstein's Bat Mitzvah.
That's, like, apretty swankyjoint, right?
Yeah, the Sappersteins are totally
loaded and she's, like, crazy spoiled.
Spoiled.
So lots of gifts, lots of cash.
Slater, you're agenius.
You're agenius, dude!
All right, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Hustle!
All right, come on, kids. Come on.
All right, thank you.
BLITHE: This place looks like aparty.
NOAH: Keep walking, keep walking.
WENDY: Maybe you should
just invite anyone you know,
anyone who's ugly,
because they seem to all be here!
MRS. SAPPERSTEIN: That's very nice.
Is that what the rabbis taught you?
Mom! This is my night. It's my celebration,
and I did not invite these nerds
to my Bat Mitzvah!
What more can I do for you?
Rent the Taj Ma-fucking-hal for you?
There's so much blue cheese here,
it smells like barf, Mom!
Damn, Wendy Sapperstein's abig ol' bitch!
Yeah, she scares me.
All right, guys,
we're gonnastay under the radar.
Okay? Keep it low profile.
Did you hear what I just said?
I said low profile! All right?
Stop puncturing balloons!
Do you understand me? (SHUSHING)
Noah, Noah.
Does this place have bottle service?
I want aRed Bull and vodka.
No, you don't. You don't even know
what that is. It's bad for you.
-Slater! You showed up!
-We've been looking all over for you!
-Oh. Hey.
-TWIN 1 : We've been dancing all night.
TWIN 2: Yeah, this Bat Mitzvah is the best!
It's like Jew city out there,
and we're the fucking mayors.
TWIN 2: You ready to go dance?
He's ready to go dance.
This guy was born to dance.
-You want to come?
-Come on. Let's go.
You big stud.
Time to go make aSlater sandwich!
Some of that gingerbread, my man.
No bathrooms, you understand me,
Rodrigo? No bano.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
-You're apendejo.
-You're aputo.
You're aputa, bitch.
I'm gonnafuck you up, dawg!
-Noah Griffith?
-Uh, hey.
That's you, right?
-Yeah. What's up? How's it going?
-It's Roxanne.
I lived in the dorms down the hall
from you, freshman year.
That's right. We were in Astronomy, right?
Yeah, I sat behind you in Astronomy.
We were, like, the only two students
who seemed to give ashit.
(CHUCKLES) That's right. Yeah.
You made that scale model of Saturn
with acantaloupe, right?
-Oh, shit, yeah.
-That was you.
-That thing was fresh. That was cool.
-Yeah, that was me.
Did you know about
the geomagnetic storm tonight?
I did. I'm gonnacheck it out. Are you?
I'm actually kind of excited for it.
Yeah. For sure.
-Yeah, it's gonnabe cool.
-Yeah, it's gonnabe pretty cool.
BANDLEADER: Stay on that dance floor!
It's time for the hora!
-(GUESTS CHEERING)
-Wow!
<i>HavaNagila, yeah.</i>
You gonnago on the chair?
-I don't think so.
-Yeah?
No. No chair for me.
I can't believe you're here.
Like, I haven't seen you in forever.
Yeah, I'm actually not in school this year.
That sucks.
But I'm working right now, obviously.
But once I get offwork, I'm going to
apool hall with some of my co-workers.
-Would you want to come?
-Oh, cool.
That would be great, but I'm actually
in the middle of asituation currently.
Oh, yeah. No worries. I just thought I'd ask.
No. Thank you. Any other time.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
-It was great running into you again.
-(LAUGHING) Oh, my God!
Put your fucking dick away!
You're getting piss all over me!
You're getting piss all over my feet!
Watch out. Come on.
BLITHE: Happy birthday, Wendy!
NOAH: Mazel tov, Wendy.
-(BLITHE YELLING)
-What were you doing?
You do not take apiss
in the middle of aparty, okay?
You don't piss in the middle
of aBat Mitzvah, you idiot!
Clayton?
(SOFTLY) Oh, shit.
What are you doing here?
What about your tarantula?
-Oh, I got over that, man.
-It's just aspider, bro.
Since when do you hang out
with Benji Gillespie?
Look, I can hang out
with as many other people as I want.
I don't think you understand that.
I'm getting kind of sick
of going to your house all the time
and watching tennis.
We do other shit.
No, we don't! You don't do anything!
I can'tjust always hang around you.
I don't get why you're being mean to me.
He doesn't want to hang out
with you anymore, bro.
How hard is it to understand that?
Just stop calling and texting him
all the time. It's weird.
Is that true?
See you around.
Yo.
Hey, man. You all right?
-Those guys fucking with you?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-You okay?
-Yeah, just leave me alone!
Hi. I'm so sorry to have to say this to you.
It's just that I can't seem to find your car.
What do you mean, you can't find my car?
Well, I think we lost it.
You didn't lose your Morrissey box set.
Where's my fucking car, dude?
(SOBS)
Did you lose it
or you taking ashit right now?
A little of both.
There's no "alittle bit" of taking ashit.
You're either shitting your pants
or you're not.
Stop crying, all right?
It's not going to solve anything.
Let's go find this shit. All right?
Hey, look! There it is!
Oh, thank God we found it.
That's not finding it, you idiot.
Someone stole it.
Oh, poo.
Three thousand bucks.
Is that good?
No. It's not. We need 7,000 more.
And it's almost 1 1 :00.
Hey, Noah, I have an idea. How about
you start your own signature fragrance?
That's agreat idea!
I'll just alert my team of scientists,
have them invent anew perfume.
We'll start selling it and we'll have
seven grand in the next 45 minutes!
-You're such ajerk.
-God damn it, my fucking shin.
I'm just trying to help.
All I know is,
is I'm going to be afamous celebrity
who designs on the side,
and I'm going to be rich.
What the hell are you talking about?
You do know thatjust being acelebrity and
having agood time is not areal job, right?
Yeah, it is! Being afamous celebrity
is the greatest thing in the world!
It means people take your picture.
You get to have birthday parties at
the coolest clubs and dance on tables.
Even for asmall child,
you sound like an idiot.
(NOAH SIGHS)
What are you walking away for?
What's your problem, dramaqueen?
My problem is that my best friend Clayton
doesn't want to hang out with me anymore
because he doesn't like me back,
and he'd rather hang out
with an asshole named Benji Gillespie.
That is my problem!
Okay, well...
-You'll make another friend.
-No.
No, I won't.
Well, I don't know the inner workings
of your friendship,
but if he doesn't like you, then screw him.
(HORN BLARING)
All right, train's coming!
Let's go!
<i>lf you only knew what it was like</i>
<i>Hoping that you see the light</i>
<i>And you always put up afight</i>
<i>l get lost within your stare</i>
(INAUDIBLE)
<i>When we breathe the same air</i>
<i>l see you everywhere</i>
<i>Oh, if you only knew</i>
BLITHE: Whoa.
NOAH: It's like actual China.
Excuse me. Is this Wing's Fish Market?
You must be Noah Griffith.
Mr. Karl is expecting you.
-Wait here, all right?
-So,
-did you get my money?
-(CLEARS THROAT) Um...
Garv, can I get some chili flakes, please?
-(MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)
-Garv, honey.
Look at me. Look at me!
Yes, I have money right here.
-Garv? Oh, boy.
-Here you go. I got it.
Not listening. He's got the headphones on.
I got the cash right here for you.
Here you go.
So how do you guys all know each other?
KARL: What the fuck

-JULIO: We got aproblem.
-What's the problem?
My man! You got $3,000 here.
You are short $7,000!
Short?
Okay, I have checks.
-KARL: Are you kidding me?
-Checks, yes.
Checks! What's the matter with you?
(LAUGHING)
Who the fuck is Wendy Sapperstein?
The Sappersteins are loaded, so they're
not gonnamiss the money at all.
Garv! Please, chili flakes! You don't listen!
-So you can sign the check over to yourself.
-KARL: I'll count to three.
-One.
-Sign the checks over?
-Two.
-Yeah, sign the checks over to yourself.
Three. Good night.
(GARV CRYING OUT IN PAIN)
-Did you hear that?
-GARV: (SOBBING) Why'd you do that?
Drop him off at the podiatrist.
Make his mom amix CD
with an apology letter.
(WAILING)
JULIO: I told you, dawg.
Now your foot match your asshole.
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
-Hey!
<i>-Hey, Karl!</i>
Hey, Marisa.

<i>-l'm at aparty!</i>

KARL: I'm always down to party.

Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Myjoint goes in and comes out

-Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.
-Yeah.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
See, when I'm stoking, I see the head,

Still, like that. Like aU-turn.

JULIO: Give him afucking hug!
KARL: Don't be shy.
You're so shy. Come here.
Hug me tight.
It's okay. It's our little secret.
But I want you to think about something.
Garv was my third best friend in the world,
and I shot him in the feet
for being abad listener.
You're my eighth best friend in the world,
and you stole from me. From my home!
You're gonnameet me

And if you don't get my seven grand,
let's just say it's gonnabe bad.
Real fucking bad!
Now get out of here!
Stop staring at me
with those gorgeous eyes.
-All right, guys, let's go.
-Can we go home?
No, I have to see somebody.
I don't want to see anybody.
Let's just go home.
Believe me, Slater,
I don't want to see this person, either.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
God damn it.
Hey, Beth?
Noah. What are you doing here?
I am babysitting these children.
Looks like we finally
have something in common, right?
I'm not your babysitter anymore, Noah.
Oh, you're not. That's right!
Because you fucked my dad
while he was still married to my mom
and ruined my life. I forgot!
Is he home, by the way?
Seven thousand dollars?
Yes.
There is no way in hell
I'm giving you seven grand, so...
Dad, you screwed Mom and I
out of child support and alimony.
Just do this one thing. We'll call it even.
All right?
You know, I have to say,
it is always some justification with you.
You are never gonnagrow up
with that attitude.
Okay, don't do that. Don't do that. Okay?
Don't pretend like you care how I turn out.
Let's be very, very straightforward
with one another.
-Okay?
-Okay.
I'm in ajam. Okay?
That's why I'm here,
because I need your help.
And I'm sorry.
I just need you to be my dad for aday.
That's it.
And I'm sorry. I can't help you.
You know what, pal? It's not my problem.
I mean, it's really not my problem.
Okay.
Daddy? Can we look at the telescope now?
JIM: Oh, hey, buddy.
Of course. Excuse me asecond.
I want you to do me afavor.
I want you to go in the kitchen
and get alittle bite to eat
for the two of us. I'll be right in, okay?
That aboy!
There's ageomagnetic storm tonight.
I forgot.
I got thrown off.
-So...
-I didn't even know.
Yeah, I have to go.
You smell like perfume.
You got alot of perfume on you.
I know. I know I do.
Why?
Gotcha, bitch.
BLITHE: Shotgun!
NOAH: All right, come on, let's go!
Let's roll. Hustle.
Rodrigo, feel free to take apiss in it.
BLITHE: Fancy car.
It smells like hotdogs.
Was that woman at the door
your babysitter?
She was, till I found out
my dad was tipping her extra
when he'd drive her home at night.
SLATER: Where are we going?
NOAH: Just got to pick up something
from my dad's store real quick.
You're breaking in?
-Not exactly.
-(ALARM RINGING)
BLITHE: Shouldn't you tell him
about this or something?
SLATER: What's wrong?
I'm typing in the code, and it's not working.
-You didn't do it right!
-Yes, I did.
-I'm doing it right.
-(ALARM CONTINUES RINGING)
-Maybe your dad changed the code.
-He didn't change the code.
Okay? The code's my birthday.
It's always been my birthday.
He didn't change it.
Maybe it's someone else's birthday.
(ALARM STOPS RINGING)
Sorry, man.
Let me guess what it is.
(BEEPS)
Booyah!
Can I tell you my gossip now?
Oh, shit, yeah. Blithe.
Not now. I think we should go, okay?
Let's go. We gottago.
I saw my daddy
kissing his assistant, Debra.
That's why he always stays late
at the hospital,
'cause he spends all night kissing Debra.
My mom knows.
She pretends like she doesn't know,
but she knows.
That's not gossip, Blithe.
You know that, right?
Well...
Sometimes people do messed-up stuff
to each other, okay?
Why?
One time I was walking down the street,
I punched my best friend Darius
in the nut sack for no reason.
Just both fists.
-Just double-punched him.
-Why would you do that?
I don't know.
You're an idiot.
That's probably true. I am an idiot.
And so is your dad.
Come on.
Hey.
Where's Rodrigo?
He's in the bathroom.
(TOILET FLUSHING)
(OMINOUS COWBOY MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, no.
No, tell me... Tell me you didn't.
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, shit!
-Why the hell did you do that, Rodrigo?
-BLITHE: Seriously, dude!
You said you didn't have
any more cherry bombs!
How many more do you have, huh?
You can'tjust go around
blowing up bathrooms! It's not cool!
Why can't you be
more like your brother and sister?
They're at least half crazy.
You're full-on nuts!
They are not my brother and sister!
They are nothing to me!
They are not my family!
She does nothing all day but paint
her face like aputa. She is aputa!
And this one is sick in the head!
He goes to the head doctor
four times aweek!
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
-Hey! Stop acting crazy, okay?
-He is the crazy one.
He has this medicine! He loco!
<i>He muy loco!</i>
-Hey, relax!
-Shut up!
You shut up with your stupid fanny pack!
I take your fanny pack!
No! No! No, I need that!
Stop it! I need that! My pills! No! No!
NOAH: What did you do that for?
-SLATER: Pull over! Pull over!
-Okay! Okay!
SLATER: Right now! Right now!
NOAH: Okay! Okay!
Slater! Where are you going?
What the fuck is your problem, man?
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
NOAH: Slater.
You're not going to find it, all right?
-I need those pills, okay? I need them.
-No, you don't.
Yes, I do, okay? I have serious issues.
You don't have serious issues.
Yes, I do! Those pills are
the only thing that keep me normal,
and I need them!
I can't do this anymore.
Slater, you're gay, all right?
What the fuck are you talking about?
-Nothing. Never mind.
-Take that back!
Take it back, Noah!
You're gay. All right?
You're as queer as afootball bat,
and that's fine.
And if your therapist
hasn't clued you into that by now,
then you should ask
for your money back, pal.
You ever think the reason you're so upset
your buddy Clayton
doesn't want to hang out anymore
is because you have
alot of special feelings for him
that maybe he doesn't feel back?
It breaks your heart, man.
And that breaks my heart.
'Cause I know what that feels like.
I feel it all the time.
I don't want to be gay! I'm not gay!
Tough.
I don't want to be afaggot!
Hey! Do not say shit like that!
Do you understand me?
This is the worst night of my life.
All right, high school is going to suck.
Coming out to your parents,
it's not gonnabe apicnic, either.
But trust me when I tell you
that when you get to college,
nobody will care.
And then, when you graduate college,
you'll get an awesome job
in the entertainment industry.
You'll be super-organized and
dress really well, you'll smell good.
Smell good?
What are you talking about, Noah?
Relax. Listen to me.
My dad hates me. All right?
I got kicked out of college.
(SIGHING)
Before tonight, this babysitting thing,
I've only ever had one job,
and I was alifeguard.
I got fired after four days because
I kept falling asleep in the sun.
I'm aconstant disappointment to my mom,
who's the only decent person in my life.
I've been arrested numerous times.
I had amonth-long, intense addiction
to Robitussin.
There's only one freak out here.
You're looking at him.
I've never had agay thought in my life,
so what does that tell you?
That tells me you're pretty messed up.
I have seen Devil Wears Prada
about 1 9 times,
but that's because it's agood movie.
It's agood flick.
Devil Wears P. You ever seen it?
<i>D Wears P?</i>
I think, like, once.
I don't really remember it though.
Nothing's wrong with you. You're normal.
Just super gay.
You're adick.
(LAUGHS) Yes, that's true.
Enough of the pills, all right?
Okay.
You know,
deep down, I think I always kind of knew.
(SIGHS) But don't tell anybody yet, okay?
I won't. I won't.
What do you think I am, an asshole?
(LAUGHING) Yeah, sort of.
Come on, Ricky Martin,
let's get out of here.
SLATER: That's an example.
Hey, Slater, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Hey! That's Mom's car!
NOAH: Are you sure?
(BEEPING)
All right. Let's go! Let's go!
BLITHE: Rodrigo's jacket must be in there!
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
BLITHE: This is my kind of club.

Hey.
What's happening, my man?

You know, this ain't no place for no kids.
These aren't kids, these are little people.
This woman's 48 years old.
Her children have children.

You're stealing my car?
I'm serious. Give me the keys.
Look, homey, we got beef.
You understand that?
Just give me the keys.
Step back, homey!
This ain't where you belong!
All right,
you're going to listen to me, okay?
You're right,
I threw up in your grandmother's ashes.
-Hell, yeah, you did.
-It was an accident.
-Fucked up.
-I apologize from the bottom of my heart.
I have been stuck
babysitting these three kids.
I was talked into buying cocaine
for my girlfriend,
who I realize is not even my girlfriend.
She's just agirl who occasionally
lets me stick my face in her crotch
-and who's mean to me all the time. Okay?
-(ALL LAUGH)
And this time, making her happy
is probably gonnaget me killed.
You're acting all gangster,
stealing cars, hanging out with thugs.
Well, you know what?
A few years ago we went to
the same lame-ass high school.
The point is,
you and I are two fucked-up kids
meeting on the playground.
I came here for my motherfucking keys
to my motherfucking minivan,
and that's what's up!
(ALL LAUGHING)
Is that supposed to be athreat, little man?
I ain't giving you shit.
It's not athreat.
I'm going to put
both my hands behind my back,
and you get one punch to my face
as hard as you want.
-I can punch you in the face?
-You deserve to punch me in the face.
Go on, baby. Punch him in the face.
(WHISPERS) My face is ready to receive you.
-Noah, don't!
-What?
CROWD: Oh!
TINA: Bitch.
-BLITHE: Noah!

You killed my babysitter!
Noah?
(GROANS) That was bad.
-BLITHE: Are you okay?

(ALL EXCLAIM IN SURPRISE)
Oh, shit. I'm all right!
-I'm okay!
-(ALL APPLAUDING)
I'm okay!
She won this round, right?
Oh, shit.
She punched my face, but it's cool!
It's all good.
Looks like we're even.
Guess you ain't the little pussy
you used to be. Huh, Noah?
Nope, I'm awhole different pussy now.
All right, boy. Respect.
Unlock it. What's inside?
Oh, shit, it's abomb.
Hell, yeah. I feel that.
NOAH: Let that debris
fall across your face, girl.
Look here, little homey.
I like your style, you dig?
I appreciate that. Thank you.
You stand up for yours,
and I can respect that.
Ifwe ever need acrazy-ass white boy
to roll with us one day
and get punched in the face
by motherfuckers, I'm-acall you.
-Know what I mean?
-Yeah, man.
Yo, listen. Listen.
Let me holler at you for asecond.
I just wannalet you know,

-It's all good, baby.
-All right, brother.
Peace to you. I fucking love you, dawg.
Noah, are you all right?
(HOARSELY) I feel so cool right now.
(LAUGHING)
This place is cool.
I honestly might start DJ-ing here.
I don't know.
Okay, that's all right,
but do you really think that
this is an appropriate place to bring kids?
I don't know. Look, Rodrigo's over there
chatting up some prostitutes.
You got Slater schooling Bell Biv DeVoe
over there in pool.
And Blithe's doing the Riverdance
over in the bowling alley.
Honestly, this is the first time
I've seen them having any kind of fun,
so what the hell?
You know what that is?
What is that?
Just me being cool. Playing it cool.
No big deal.
You're crazy.
You're crazy slash beautiful. Whatever.
So, did you drive here?
No, I took acab.
Maybe you should take my dad's car,
because I can't drive
both of them anyways.
Are you serious?
Yeah, it'd actually really help me out.
Okay. How are you gonnafind me?
Do you have aphone?
Okay. See you.
-Yeah. (LAUGHS)
-Just kidding.
Here, this is my phone number,
and then you can call me.
Okay.
I'll call you.
Hey,
why did you say something to me
when you saw me earlier? I feel like
you kind of ignored me all freshman year.
I don't know.
I thought you were really funny and smart
and seemed really sweet.
I guess I was kind of nervous
to talk to you back then.
You were nervous to talk to me?
Yeah.
(MOBILE RINGING)
My phone's ringing.
Shit, it's my girlfriend. I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

-What's wrong with you?
-You want to know what's wrong with me?
This is my third family in three years.
When your papas get tired with me,
they give me to another families.

Well, maybe if you didn't do
such messed-up stuff
then they would actually feel
like you wanted to be here.
You don't know me. You look at me

That's not true. You never talk to us.

You'd better be very careful
how you talk to me.
Because I'm going to be at home

And I'm going to have one eye
on my three friends up there

I just want you
to get your act together, Doc.
