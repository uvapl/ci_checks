BARTOK: Dr. Jainway, do not think
this child is a laboratory animal.
l want you to take care of him
as though he were my very own.
You will all answer to Dr. Jainway.
She, in turn, will answer to me.
l, in turn, will answer
to nobody but God.
From Gods mouth to your ears,
that is the chain of command.
ls that understood?
JAlNWAY: Here we have
an average 1 1 -month-old child.
And here we have our
1 1 -month-old child.
As you can see, his life cycle is
dramatically accelerated.
Now, these are aberrant chromosomes.
Obviously a product
of genetic mutation.
These are all dormant, something
in addition to accelerated growth.
And his non-genetic characteristics?
His learning abilities, for example.
Hes got a photographic memory.
He doesnt just learn,
he consumes information.
And he never sleeps.
ls that so?
Do you like him?
Well, as a clinical subject,
l find him astonishing.
But he does try our patience when
it comes to medical examinations.
l think its time our young guest
and l became acquainted.
Were not interrupting, are we?
Not at all, Mr. Bartok.
What a handsome young man you are.
Do you know who l am?
Yes, youre one of the people
who lives behind the mirror.
Well, my name is Mr. Bartok.
ld like you to think
of me as your dad.
Martin. . .
. . .whats that behind your ear?
You know, its knowing the right
magic word that makes it happen.
lts a real magic word, a secret word
that you keep locked away. . .
. . .inside your heart
and you never tell anybody.
No, you dont tell anybody,
and thats what makes the magic work.
SHEPARD:
Martin.
Martin, are you listening to me?
Dr. Shepard. . .
. . .l dont mean to be rude
by not facing you.
But those tests are far too simple to
demand my full attention.
Besides, lm almost finished.
So am l, Martin.
l just have to time you on this maze,
and we can both do something we enjoy.
Very impressive, Martin.
People, my I hve your ttention?
Ive grown tired of your
trivil influence.
Another outburst nd Ill be forced
to mke n exmple of you.
Youve outdone yourself.
But what else does it do?
(SlGHS)
JAlNWAY:
Keep still, Martin. Stop fidgeting.
ls Mr. Bartok gonna visit today?
You know how busy he is.
He has that project in zone four.
Oh, yeah.
Can l go visit him?
-Of course not, youre not allowed.
-Why?
Because you dont have
zone four clearance.
How much longer do l have
to take these shots for?
As long as you would like to live.
Why dont l have clearance?
Because youre only a zone three
project. Youre fidgeting.
lts normal behavior.
l read it in a book for mothers.
Want to see?
No, thank you.
Now, sit still or Mr. Bartok
will be very disappointed in you.

. . .so rare, theres only been
two people whove ever had it.
My father.
And now me.
They even named it after him.
lts called Brundles
Accelerated Growth Syndrome.
The doctors say it means lm growing
up a lot faster than lm supposed to.
Which isnt so bad, l guess.
But l think it also means that
lm gonna die a lot sooner.
Which isnt so great.

Due to your unique affliction,

Youve been very good to me.
l dont know how to thank you.
Perhaps l can think of something.
ld like you to consider taking
a position here at Bartok lndustries.
-Position?
-Something challenging.
To keep you from being bored.
A match for your intellect,
your creative mind.
lm talking about a job.
BARTOK: Five years
and millions of dollars later. . .
. . .and what we have is--
What we have
is the worlds most expensive. . .
. . .juicer.
The greatest invention
in the history of mankind. . .
. . .and we cant get
the damn thing to work.
Were like chimpanzees trying to
figure out how to operate a car.
Your father was a brilliant man.
Brilliant, but erratic.
When he died,
some of his secrets died with him.
You could finish your fathers work.
Youre as brilliant as he was,
perhaps even more so.
l dont like these things.
lts because of the dog, isnt it?
How long will you
hold that against me?
lt was a tragic mistake,
but thats in the past now.
You must concentrate on the future.
The future is right here
in this very room.
lmagine a new era of surgery
without incision.
Cutting people would be primitive,
a thing of the past.
All the things that would
become obsolete overnight.
Thats what these machines represent.
A new age.

. . .Dr. Trimble and his people
are at your disposal.
lf you want to work alone, fine.
lts your choice.
Martin. . .
. . .we did everything we could
for your dog.
Take comfort in knowing
he didnt suffer long.
And one more thing.

of his progress.

Hi.
Thats wonderful.
How did you do this?
l started from scratch.
Trimble and the rest asked the wrong
questions, made the same mistakes.
They were too close to
the problem to see it clearly.
Scientific myopia.
They thought of it in terms of
methodology, of physics.

But you have to be able to open
your eyes and admire. . .
. . .the beauty of the process.

What is this?
Just a little accident.
