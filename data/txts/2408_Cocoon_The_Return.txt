Now remember, if your loop
is large...
Your rug is loose.
Let's all repeat that, shall we?
[All] If your loop is large,
your rug is loose.
Good. Now let's give it a try.
Make a loop, pull it through...
Cross over and pull it out.
Tighten those loops,
Mr. Lefkowitz.
Tighten those loops, Mr. Lefkowitz.
This rest home.
You wouldn't believe the place.
"Lights on!"
"Lights off!"
Rules, rules, rules.
They don't even let you
keep a hot plate.
I shouldn't complain.
Today was an exciting day.
I learned how to hook a rug.
A man who at one time had
the entire garment district right here.
That's how I spend my days.
It isn't fair.
You work all your life,
you pay taxes...
You're a good citizen.
What are you left with?
A tight rug.
I miss you, Rose.
Well, sailors, my glass-bottom boat...
Is about to give you a special treat.
So, hold onto your lanyards.
What you have before you, ladies
and gentlemen...
Is the climax of today's adventure
The famous lost treasure
of the Florida Keys!
Amazing, isn't it?
Oh, good people, it's been here since
the days of Ponce de Leon...
And Vasco da Gama, even Moby Dick
What a rip-off.
Now, if there aren't any more questions...
We'll be heading back to port
where our gift kiosk...
Carries an attractive line
of postcards, T-shirts...
And other treasures.
Full steam ahead, matey!
Yo, ho, yo, ho
A pirate's life for me
Shiver me timbers!
Stop! What the hell are you doin'?
Them's my french fries.
Oh, Mama!
Hi, honey. I'm home.
Hi, Mom!
- How's the term paper coming?
- Fine.
David? I hope that's
not the TV I hear.
No, Mom.
I have such a pain in my heart, Mama.
That's not funny, Evelyn.
- David.
- Who's there?
It's me, David. It's your grandpa.
I gotta talk to ya.
- Grandpa!
- Yep. Your grandma and l are comin' to see ya.
- Really?
- Our friends got some unfinished
business to do there...
And it was a chance for
your grandmother and I to grab a ride.
You're gonna have to talk to your mother,
because she won't be ready for this.
What do I say? She's gonna freak.
Just tell her the truth.
How about that?
- Look, I'll see you soon, son.
- Great!
I know how much you loved
Grandma and Grandpa...
And how much you wish
they were here with us...
So it's only normal to fantasize.
But it's important to know
it's only a fantasy.
But it's not a fantasy.
Maybe it would help if you talked
to somebody about this, David.
Mom, I don't need to see a shrink.
They're not dead. They really did
go to another planet.
Your grandparents are not in space...
They're not in the television
and they're not coming back.
They were lost at sea. You know that.
They've been dead for five years.
Hello, darling.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Just a minute.
Oh! Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute!
Well, aren't you gonna invite us in?
Oh, for crying out loud! Joe!
Joe! Alma!
Oh, Bess! How are ya?
Art! Come in, Art!
- It's so wonderful!
- It's great to see ya, boy.
What's to see? I'm just a broken-down
old schlep with one foot in the grave.
- If I was a horse, they'd shoot me.
- Same old Bernie.
You haven't aged a day.
You probably think I'm a jerk
for not going with you.
- Oh, Bernie, we never thought that.
- Good.
Because I never regretted it. I never
once regretted not going with you.
What's that? A little remodeling?
Oh, the-the-- the maintenance
here is aw-- You wouldn't believe it.
I-- I ought to sue. I think it's--
By the way, you owe me rent.
It's all yours-- all your things.
They tried to throw them out after you left..
but I told them, "Over my dead body."
I guess they figured that wouldn't be long.
Bernie, you're a sentimental fool.
Well, I'm glad you got here just in time...
Because I've been thinking
about a garage sale.
How have you really been?
The truth? Not too good.
But now, maybe things are looking up.
I think it's gonna be like--
like old times.
I think. Huh?
I feel terrible.
We let him think we were staying.
Do you wanna be the one
to burst his bubble?
So, what do we do, let him think
we're staying here for good?
We're gonna have to tell him
sooner or later.
Hold it. I'll tell him.
I'll tell him, but not until
I think he can handle it.
Right?
Good morning, my little Antarean butterfly.
Smells like I'm gonna gain about 5
pounds this morning.
At least. How you feel?
Finer than frog hair.
Where is everybody?
Oh, the first group went through.
Here. Have some coffee.
I made a fresh pot.
How's Susie this mornin'?
All things considered,
I think she's holding up very well.
It's good to be back, isn't it?
Yeah.
- I got the moves, don't I, kid?
- Ah.
I didn't marry you for your money.
Well, I'll be god damned.
- What is it?
- Here.
I'll be right back.
Look at this!
Is this beautiful?
You are beautiful
- You have an incredible eye, sir.
You must be a collector.
- No.
Oh, a shrewd one at that.
Well, I will not insult you by haggling.
This Davy Jones treasure chest--
a beauty, isn't it?
I can give it to you
for... $19.95.
For that piece of junk?
Your wife obviously doesn't appreciate
fine antiques the way you do.
Listen, you take the box,
and I'll throw in...
The barnacle salt and pepper shakers
for free.
- Sold.
- Ha ha!
Lovely.
Sean, uh-- Uh, take care
Of those folks, will you?
Hello, Jack.
Oh, I don't believe it.
What are you doin' here?
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
You searched the entire galaxy,
couldn't find anyone as terrific as me.
The cocoons are in danger, Jack.
The sensors that we left on the bottom
of the ocean floor indicate seismic activity.
- Oh.
- We've come to take our friends away.
We've got 4 days to rescue them...
Before our ship returns to take us home.
Seismic activity. That's heavy.
I mean, I was in an earthquake,
so I know. It's very intense.
Well, aren't you glad to see me?
Isn't it a custom here
to give an old friend a hug...
When you haven't seen her in a long time?
Yeah. Of--
Yeah, of course.
Hey, Romeo! Do you think
You could tear yourself away...
long enough to ring up
my clamshell castanets?
Mm!
Oh, my love is like a red, red rose...
That's newly sprung in June.
Oh, my love is like a melody...
That is sweetly played in tune.
Oh, Arthur, darling.
It's perfect.
Do you want me to fix us some breakfast?
Don't have time.
Gonna meet the boys and pick up Bernie.
- Poor Bernie.
- Oh, nonsense.
We're gonna get him out of that damn hospital
room and get his blood pumping again.
Ah! That's Joe.
- Oh. Will you miss me?
- I already do.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Selwyn.
- Oh.
- How'd you sleep?
Best night's sleep I've had in years.
- How about Bess?
- She slept like a baby.
- What about you two?
- Alma didn't sleep a wink.
- You're kiddin'?
- No.
- Neither did I.
- Oh, you dog, you!
You smell that?
Yeah. Incense.
Maybe a Hindu runs the place.
Back here.
Come on back, whoever you are.
Believe it or not, I'm open for business.
Hya, fellas. What can I do for you?
- Mrs. Feinberg?
- Call me Ruby. Did you ever try this?
It delivers oxygen-rich blood...
To the pleasure centers of the brain.
Itís terrific Will you give me a hand?
I'm new at this. It's a little tough
gettin' out of this cookie.
Here we go. Okay?
Come on. Don't be shy.
Now, put me right-side up.
Right-side up.
Easy! Take it easy, fellas.
Easy, easy. That is great.
Okay, okay.
That's it. That's it.
Okay. Now you grab an ankle,
and you grab an ankle.
There's the left one. Terrific.
That is it.
Great. Oh, boy.
That's terrific. That's-- I feel--
I feel sensational!
- Thanks a lot.
- Nice little place you got here, uh, Ruby.
Do you hear that, Sidney?
It's a nice little place I got here.
Sidney was my husband.
This dump was his dream.
Unfortunately, the son of a bitch died
and left me to live it.
- Oh, that's tough.
- Nah. It's not so bad.
I just like to yak.
Now, tell me, you two
on vacation or what?
- Well--
- We, uh, came down to see old friends.
- Oh.
- Your night clerk told us to talk to you
about staying the week.
Sure thing. No problem.
This is not exactly my busy season.
Great.
There's Ben. We'd better get crackin'.
- See ya around, Ruby.
- Count on it.
Oh! Hey, will you get a load
of the sunshine!
- I feel like a teenager.
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.
- Last one to the car buys dinner.
- Hey! Yeah!
- Come on, slowpoke!
-You got a head start
-Where are you, boy?
- Yahoo!
- Hey, hey! Not bad, Superman!
We'll have to stop at a pharmacy.
If I don't have zinc oxide,
I'll burn to a crisp.
So we'll stop at a pharmacy.
Did you bring juice? I'll get dehydrated.
- Yeah, we'll get juice.
- Hey, Bernie.
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- None of your business.
It is when you're supposed to be
in your rug hooking class.
- Take your hands off him.
- Or what?
- Or you'll be sorry.
- I said let him go.
Get outta my way, you old coot.
Easy, Rambo.
- What do you say we blow this joint?
- Yes.
After you.
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, look at that!
- Come on! Here we go!
Last one in's a pantywaist!
Last one in ain't got a hair on his ass!
Here we go!
Where is everybody?
- How's the water?
- It was great. It was just great.
Beautiful beach, a sunny day
and good friends.
What more can a man ask for?
Can I have some of that, please?
- Come on!
- Look at them move.
Gentlemen, Iíd say
all that those ladies are lacking..
is a little mature male company.
- Yeah.
- How about it?
I think youíre right.
Come on, Bernie. You wanna dip your wick?
Come on.
Over here! Over here!
Ben! Ben! Over here!
Ben! Ben!
Come on!
Come on, in!
Right here! Here, here!
Joe. I've gotta go.
- I've got an appointment.
- An appointment?
- Yeah.
- We're playing a game here, Bernie.
It's important.
Okay, Bernie. I'll get the guys.
Art. Ben.
How's this feel?
Perfect. You are a good friend, Jack.
- I knew we could count on you to help us out.
- It's no sweat.
You're my favorite Martian.
Well, I guess we're ready, and we'll
be back in about an hour's time.
Yeah, okay.
- "My favorite Martian." That's good.
- See? He gets it.
St Petersburg Oceanographic Institute."
They got a cocoon.
Holy shit.
Batter, batter, batter! Swing!
Next!
That's okay, David. Come on.
It's only batting practice.
Come on, Tommy.
You're up. Take a cut.
Screwed up again, guy.
No matter how many times I see that,
it's still impressive.
So, what's the mystery?
You're out analyzing...
The effects of earthquakes on marine
life and you find some old meteorite.
No. When a meteor enters the atmosphere,
the pressure and the temperature...
Will leave characteristic markings.
This baby doesn't have them.
Whatever it is, it didn't fall from the sky.
It's weird-looking.
It's kinda like a dinosaur egg.
What do you think, Sara? Do you
subscribe to the dinosaur egg theory?
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?
It's a life form.
I'm gonna get a hot dog
and an ice-cold beer.
- How about you?
- Sure. I'll have a beer.
You get a milk shake. In you go.
Hey, look! It's Wade Boggs.
How's it hangin', doofus?
- That guy can't hit worth shit.
- Wanna let me in on that?
I read somewhere, I don't know
where it-- Maybe Ted Williams.
He said the hardest thing
in sports to do...
Is hit a round ball...
with a round bat.
What you gotta do...
Is learn how to hit the ball
with some degree of control.
Now you go over by the bucket,
and I'm gonna hit some of these.
Now watch. I'm gonna try
to see the ball hit the bat.
Boom. See? And you don't
have to swing hard. Give me a ball.
- Okay.
- Now you.
Okay. Come over here.
Now think. Try and see the ball hit the bat.
All right! Now you're cookin'.
Let's go, let's go. A little pep.
All right that's the one.
You ought to have your head examined.
It was just a little baseball.
Here. Over here.
Just a little ball game.
No big deal.
This is Earth, Ben, not Antarea.
As long as we're here,
we keep getting older.
I know.
But with this kind of fringe benefit...
Maybe it's worth it.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Well, it's been such a long time since
you needed me for anything like this.
I guess I kinda missed it.
Yeah. I missed it too.
I know.
It's not your fault.
How were you supposed to know
that an earthquake...
Is gonna knock one of those cocoons
out of its hiding place?
I'm responsible for him. They're
counting on me to bring him back home.
And I'm going to need a blueprint of
the Institute so I can plan his rescue.
I'll help you. I'll do whatever you want.
But I got in a lot of trouble last time,
so you cannot steal any more old people.
- We're not doing that.
- All right then. All right, fine.
- Let's just go bust him out.
- It's not that easy.
We canít free him without the risk
of drawing attention to ourselves.
We're gonna go back in 3 days,
and then we'll rendezvous with the ship.
3 days?
You're crazy. Kitty, 3 days,
they'll cut it open...
And perform grotesque experiments.
He-- I'm sorry. I-- I didn't mean--
I'm sorry.
I'm so-- I'm--
We're going to get him back.
- Hello. How are you doing?
- Hi.
- Look at this. Slick as a whistle.
You're not so bad yourself.
Joe, Iím in heaven. Isn't this wonderful?
You're the one who didn't wanna come back.
You glad I twisted your arm?
I think I was afraid
it wouldn't be the same.
But it's better.
- Look at this. What are we gonna do about him?
- I asked him to dance.
Forget it. Bernie hasn't cut a rug
in 30 years.
Joe. Maybe we should go
and keep him company.
I see something that'll get
his juices flowing.
One more of these...
And I am no longer responsible.
- Waiter! Waiter!
- Oh!
You are my kind of group.
Most people our age are a pain in the ass.
Most people our age are dead.
Oh, Bernie.
- Where did he get to be so funny?
- Yeah, Bernie.
- How'd you get to be so funny?
- I always thought Bernie was funny.
- Me too.
- You have?
Oh, you don't think I'm funny, Joe?
Watch this.
I'll show you funny.
Presenting Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy.
Oh!
This is an eagle who just found out...
His teenage daughter's pregnant.
You know what? You are adorable!
What's the ma--
Are you all right? What's the matter?
- It was just a little kiss.
- I'm a married man.
Oh, pardon me. I'm so sorry.
- Your friends told me that you were available.
- What?
- Bernie, we just thought--
- You just thought what, Joe?
That Iíd forgotten about Rose,
that her memory means nothing to me?
Well, I got news for you.
It means everything.
Now, don't break up
your little party on my account.
I'll get a cab.
He's a fun guy... barrel of laughs.
Thanks for the intro.
- I'm sorry, Ruby.
- Yeah. Forget it.
Like I said, we had some laughs.
Ruby, underneath it all...
He really is a wonderful guy.
Yeah? Thanks for the drink.
Now pay attention to teacher.
- Behave yourself. Michael, stop pushing.
- Wanna see me climb up?
Oh, Kelly. Why'd you fall from there?
I told you so many times.
Ah, shh. It's not gonna hurt.
Hi. Is it bad?
I don't think so, but I'd like to have
someone look at it.
She banged her head pretty hard.
Aw, poor little pretty.
Now, that's a bad bump.
Let me see if I can take it away.
Now.
I got it. Let's throw it away.
- Wow. You've got the touch.
Listen, uh, the first aid
station's over there.
Would you mind watching the kids
just for a few minutes?
- Okay. You go take care of her.
- Oh, thanks.
Just blow this if they attack.
All right, children.
Gather round.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.
Your pals said to tell you
theyíd be a few minutes late.
Fine. I'll wait outside.
Aw, don't be silly.
Take the load off your feet.
I don't bite, you know.
I'll just stand here by the door.
Okay. Suit yourself.
Listen, um...
I'm sorry about last night, okay?
Forget about it.
No, I don't think so.
I don't like loose ends.
Maybe we could, um, smooth things out..
over a cocktail?
That's not necessary.
I accept your apology.
You're afraid of me, aren't you?
- I certainly am not.
- Okay.
Then there's no problem.
Pick you up at 7:00.
So, finally..
After the longest trip
You could ever imagine...
their spaceship landed, and it was time
for them to see their new home.
The spaceship's door slowly opened...
And there before them
was the magic planet--
the most beautiful sight
any of them had ever seen.
The sky was gold,
and shining down on them...
were 3 pale, pale pink moons.
So they stepped outside, and guess what
- What?
- They floated.
That's right. They could fly like birds.
So they all joined hands, and, with
their new friends leading the way...
They flew off to a-- a silver city...
Shimmering in the distance.
- Can we go there?
- Oh, hold on now. It's very far.
And besides, if you left here,
think of all the things you'd miss.
- Did they have ice cream?
- No.
- Santa Claus go there?
- I'm afraid it's too far for Santa to make it.
Then how come those people went there?
Well, on that planet, no one ever gets sick...
No one ever gets old and no one ever dies.
So if youíre in love with someone...
You never have to lose them.
What happens if you fall in love with ice cream?
You're in trouble.
- I like that one!
- You do?
Here we go, fellas. Stake your claim.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- Is that a hot dog or what? Huh?
- State of the art.
- Do you know what they put in those things?
- I do.
- And thanks for reminding me.
- Have a bite, Bernie.
They say the chili kills the bugs.
Very funny. Give me gas for a week.
- Hmm.
- You know something, Bernie?
You'd fit in the <i>Guinness
Book of World Records</i> for complainers.
- Oh! Hey, come on!
- Sorry about that. You guys wanna throw our ball back?
What do we look like, your personal servants?
- Go get it yourself.
- Hey, look, we said we're sorry.
Don't give us any shit.
Just give me the ball back.
Don't do it, Joe. Look at the mess they made.
- If I was you, I'd keep quiet, pops.
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Hold it! Hold it a minute!
Let's be gentlemen about this.
I say we settle this
with a little four-on-four.
- Get real.
- Great idea.
- What, are you nuts?
- Tell you what I think.
I'm willin' to bet $10...
We can make 11 baskets
before you hotshots can.
My money's on the table.
Come on. Get it up.
It's like takin' money from a dyin' man.
You dudes got yourself a game.
- Let's go! Come on!
- There you go!
Back! Let's go!
- Whoo!
- Yes! In your face, grandpa!
- In! In! Over here!
- Get him!
- Watch it! Watch it!
- Art! Art!
I got him! I got him! I got him!
- Yea!
- Just like downtown.
Okay. No more charity.
Now we're gonna play.
-Hey, man!
-Defense! Defense! Watch the defense!
I got him! I got him!
Come on, fellas! Let's not give up!
- Joe, what's the score?
- 7-1, for God's sake!
Art! Art! Shoot!
8-2! We're catching up.
- Guard your man!
- Guard your-- Where--
Guard who?
- Hey, hey!
- Watch him! Watch him! Here we go!
- Hey! Nice one.
- Hey, that's 9-2. You guys give up?
No. Do you?
- Come on, in!
Time out. Time out. Come on.
What's the matter? You pooped?
Fellas. Fellas.
Okay. I think it's time
we showed 'em what we learned.
- You're damn right. Art?
- I couldn't agree more.
Let's go.
Now, boys, now.
- Watch him! Hold it!
- Go, Art! Go!
Get your man! Stay on him!
Come on! Take him!
Wow!
Great, Joe! Great!
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Go, Ben! Go!
Let her rip, in! Let her rip!
- What's the score?
- 10-5. Guard your man!
Which one is my--
I say which one is my--
In his face!
Watch it!
Cover him!
- Atta boy!
- Are you my man?
Concentrate, fellas! Concentrate!
9-10, your favor.
Gettin' nervous?
Oh, man!
Art!
Hallelujah!
10-10. Next basket wins.
All right! All right!
- Break! Over here!
- Bernie! Break!
Go! Go!
- Bernie! Shoot!
Go for it, Bernie! Go for it!
In your face, junior!
That's the way, Bernie! You were great!
You're the greatest!
Oh. Oh!
That is to die!
It sure is.
The price tag alone would kill ya.
- Maybe you should try it on.
- Oh, are you kidding?
- I've never shopped in a store like this.
- Me either.
Where would any of us wear
a get-up like that?
In our dreams.
That settles it.
My God! Bess.
- Oh, it's terrific!
- Oh!
- Ta-da!
- Oh! Oh, my.
Itís gorgeous.
I don't believe it.
- Oh!
- Oh, wow!
Bess, that's lovely.
Oh, that's so sexy. I think it suits you
Oh, Bess!
- Jean, get some water.
- I'll get some water.
- Think I should call a doctor?
- Are you all right?
How about some hot coffee?
I just can't understand
what could be wrong.
She was in perfect health.
And the minute we get back,
this happens.
There isn't any justice.
If there were, it'd be me in there, not her.
- Now, don't be ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.
You don't know her, Joe, not the way I do.
She's the most generous...
Loving and giving person
I've ever met.
She's the only one...
That's ever really loved me.
I'd trade places with her
in a heartbeat...
If I could.
Okay. Just a few more inches, Bob.
You're doing very well.
All right. That's fine. Doug, Ray.
Let's lift it off.
Carefully... Carefully...
Don't be afraid.
You guys okay?
What are we doing, gang?
They've opened the cocoon, Jack.
- Is he gonna be all right?
- For a short time.
But if he doesn't get an infusion
of life force soon...
He'll weaken quickly.
Mr. Selwyn?
That's me, Doctor. How is she?
She's fine, well, considering her age...
And the fact that she's 6-weeks pregnant.
Well, you smutty old devil.
Very impressive, Mr. Selwyn.
- Pregnant?
- This one's definitely going in the books.
- Congratulations.
- Don't you go near him.
- She's preg-- Preg--
- Uh-huh.
- Safe!
- All right, all right!
All right, all right!
Hold it a second. Let me clean the plate.
All right, here we go. Let's play ball!
- Strike!
- Come on, kid! Be a hitter!
Come on, Davey! You can do it!
Strike two!
Come on, David! We need this!
You can do it! Let's play ball!
- Come on, Davey!
- Strike three! You're outta here!
Well?
How you doin'?
Fine, considering I'm the worst player
in the whole league.
That don't sound like the fella
I saw hit the ball yesterday.
I told you.
It's different when I'm with you.
You want me to hit it.
And you think your pals
don't want you to hit it. Is that it?
I'm just no good at stuff.
I always mess up.
You know, that could be true.
I don't know.
But I know you're not the only kid...
That ever felt scared or anxious...
Or couldn't hit a baseball.
You see, when I was a kid
playiní baseball--
a little younger than you--
they always sent me to right field.
That's where they send the duds.
And then when I got up to bat..
there was no way in the world
I could hit that ball.
- But you can do it now.
- Sure I can.
But see, I've had
my whole life to work on it.
You can hit too. I've seen ya.
You see...
It looks to me like what you're doin'...
Is listenin' to a lot of people
tell you - you can't do it.
When maybe what you should
be doin' is listenin' to yourself...
Say that you can.
And I want you to remember somethin'.
I love ya...
And all I want for ya is the very best
that life has to offer.
But see, you're gonna have
to go get it yourself.
- Yeah.
- Now think about that, will ya?
Okay.
Thanks, Grandpa.
Mr. Finley?
Why don't you have a seat, Mr. Finley?
We'll talk about this.
We don't really need to talk, Doctor.
Just tell me what's wrong.
You had leukemia a few years back...
But it went into
complete remission, right?
Right.
- I've got it again, haven't I?
- Yes.
I'd like to get you started on chemo.
How long have I got, Doctor?
The disease is unpredictable.
It may spread quickly
Or it may go into periodic remission.
Six months. Six years.
I honestly don't know.
- Great.
- And magnetic readings are still the same.
- I'll take over for a while.
- Okay.
If only you could talk.
Did you do that?
Is he doing what I think he's doing?
- I think so. Call Dr. Baron.
- Right.
Relax.
Contraction ends.
Now take a deep, cleansing breath.
Oh, that's my little mummy.
Hi.
Thank goodness. I was about
to organize a search party.
I have so much to tell you
Me too. Sorry I'm late.
The market was jammed.
This has been the most incredible day.
First Bess, and then guess what.
I met a woman who runs
a preschool for foster children.
She just called and offered me a job.
Isn't that something?
In all my life, no one's
ever offered me a job.
She said she was impressed by
the way I handled the children.
So what did you tell her?
I said I'd have to talk to you.
I'm going back tomorrow just to help out.
How can you take a job when we're
leaving in two days' time?
Joe, for heaven's sake.
I was just pleased to get the offer.
I didn't say I was taking it.
Then why didn't you
turn her down on the spot?
I don't know.
I suppose I just wanted
the fantasy to last a little longer.
I'll tell her tomorrow.
What's your news?
What? Oh--
Those groceries are a lot more expensive
than they used to be.
Thank you for coming. We're
Going to start the demonstration now.
Sara, please.
See?
All right.
You can't fool him. You see?
Oh.
I'm going to make arrangements
to move him to a secure location.
- I want to keep this very quiet.
- Fine.
- Good work. Job well done.
- Thank you
Congratulations. I am very impressed
With you and your facility.
My reports to the joint chiefs
will reflect that
All I'm saying is we have no idea how a drastic
change in environment might affect him.
He's obviously losing his strength,
and a dead alien...
Isn't gonna do you or the military
or anybody else any good.
Come on now, Sara.
I know youíre fond of him...
But don't let your emotions
overrule your scientific judgment.
You're not giving him
to M.I.T. or the Smithsonian.
You're turning him over to the Air Force.
We are turning him over
to the government.
There's a genuine national security issue here.
There you are.
Hello, Jack.
Hey,
Got you a little something--
sort of a "get your mind
off your problems" present.
Thank you.
I really love it.
Me too. I can't understand...
why weíre not selling
more of them though.
You're a good friend, Jack.
Friend? Friend, friend,
friend, friend.
Kitty, we are more than friends.
We shared ourselves and everything.
- Would you like it if we shared ourselves again?
- Like it?
I would love it. I've been dreaming
about it for five years.
- Well, then let's go back to your cabin.
- Huh?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You Antareans may have the market
cornered in sharing yourselves...
But you don't know
the first thing about romance.
I mean, Kitty, I'm the kind of guy--
I need to have a nice dinner, you know?
Music, a little candlelight.
I charmingly convince you to ask me
back to your cabin for a nightcap.
And then...
We share our brains out.
Hop in!
Oh!
How can you stand this racket?
What are you talking about?
This is a terrific joint.
I haven't heard a word of English
since we walked into the place.
You know something? When you want to...
You do a great impression of an old fart.
Oh, thanks! Oh, thank you very much.
I can't wait.
Mmm!
- What is this?
- It's Cuban punch...
And it's delicious.
Go ahead, Bernie. You'll
probably hate it, but force yourself.
Uh-huh.
Bernie. Bernie. Oh, my God.
You are a real nutcase.
That's 151-proofrum!
Maybe I was thirsty. Waitress!
Oh, waitress!
This way.
I tell ya, this place must be great.
I have no idea what we just ordered.
Is this a ritual that's commonly practiced
before people share themselves?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. Absolutely.
See, this is romantic.
You got champagne, ambiance. You know?
Gets you in the mood.
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Voila. Bon appetit.
- Gracias.
- What is this, Jack?
- Uh, this is, um--
Oh, this is bon appetit.
This is French food.
See, it's ìterrifique.îù They don't say
ìterrific,îù they say ìterrifique."
Mmm.
You okay?
- Jack.
- Hmm?
I want to rub this bon appetit...
Over every inch of your body.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, let's do it. Let's do it.
We'll get an order to go.
- Uh, garcon. Uh, senor--
What did I say? I said something funny?
Oops! I guess that bite got away
From you, huh, honey?
What's the big idea?
I'm really enjoying this bon appetit, Jack.
Oh.
Kitty, you're having some sort of
extraterrestrial reaction to this stuff.
- Don't be silly. I feel wonderful.
- Well, I think...
- maybe the best thing would be for us to--
- N-No, Jack. No.
- Kitty, listen to me.
- Jack!
- You gotta trust me. Trust me on this, Kitty.
- No. Jack!
Oh, honey, what's the rush?
Don't you want your entree?
- Oh, my God!
- No, Jack
I want to share myself with you right now.
Oh. Ooh.
I don't know if thatís such a good idea...
In front of all these nice people.
Oh, hold it, Kitty. Don't do it.
Not here. Not here!
Kitty, please. Heads up!
Ah!
Kitty!
Must be something she ate. Huh!
In coming!
Keep the change!
You know I figured out something about you
Yeah? What?
Once a person gets past
that tight-assed routine of yours...
- you're not a bad guy.
- No.
No. And I'll tell you
something else, Lefkowitz.
You make me laugh.
Imitation of an owl.
I think youíre very pretty.
You do?
Thanks.
- Rose!
- Bernie?
Rosie.
Hey, Bernie!
- What's the matter, you sick or something?
- This was a mistake.
I shouldn't have come.
Jesus Christ. What the hell
are you talking about?
- I can't do this to Rose. I think we better go now.
- Bullshit!
Bernie, bullshit!
Your wife is just an excuse.
Do you know that?
She's just an excuse
so you don't have to go on living.
Well, guess what, buster...
Life goes on!
And if you had any-- if youíll
pardon my French-- balls...
Youíd face up to the fact
that she's dead!
Rose is dead, Bernie, and you're not!
Are you all right?
Um-- I, um--
I was going through one of...
Susan's photo albums today...
And there were some pictures of David...
On his 14th birthday...
At a New Year's party.
It's five years of his growing up
that we've missed.
This is our family. My life doesn't have
any meaning without them.
Ben, I want us to stay here.
I want us all to be together.
Look, I know you're worried...
About the boy and his mother.
I'm worried too.
Look around, honey. Everybody we know...
Except for Bernie, is sick or dying.
They're droppin' like flies.
Honey, I don't
want to watch that happen to you.
I don't want it to happen to me.
And we can beat it, you know.
But it's not right!
People shouldn't outlive
their children.
Do you want the truth?
I'm scared of death.
Well, don't you think I know that?
I'm scared too-- not of dying.
I'm scared of living without you.
But I don't want to leave here!
Good morning.
- How's it goin'?
- Good.
I think we can get in and out of the
Institute without ever being discovered.
Great. Great.
It was some date last night, huh?
How you feelin'?
Foolish.
I should have known better than to eat
something when I didn't know what it was.
Mm.
But thank you for taking care of me.
- So, where did you sleep?
- Are you kidding? Sleep?
I was up all night waiting
for the cops to show up.
Well, I guess we made a clean getaway.
I'm sorry, Jack. Is there any way
that I can make it up to you?
Oh, come on. Come on, Kitty.
Compared to some of my dates...
Last night was a raging success.
I don't know.
Sometimes I think maybe I'll be...
One of those guys who never finds anyone...
lives on TV dinners, talks to his dog
Which is okay, 'cause I kind of like dogs.
Jack, I'd like to show you something...
But in order to see it,
you're gonna have to close your eyes.
This isn't gonna be anything kinky now, is it?
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay.
- Oh. Oh, wow.
- Shh.
Vital signs are dropping fast.
Respiration rate's down. Looks bad.
I think that dog and pony show
wore him out. What do you think?
I think that in a couple of days
it'll be out of our hands.
That's what I think.
- How do you know it'll work?
- It has to work
He wasn't revived properly.
If we don't get him back now,
he won't survive.
We need your help.
- I don't know.
- Thanks.
Breaking into that place sounds kind of risky...
Especially now that the military's involved.
Joe's right. What if we get caught?
Will you listen to us?
We're back less than a week...
And already we're beginning to sound
like a bunch of frightened old geezers.
Have we forgotten what they've done
for us, what they've given us?
As far as I'm concerned,
we owe them everything.
If one of their friends needs help,
I'm damn well gonna give it.
You can count me in.
Well, we're in.
- Okay. Count us in too.
- Good.
Once we get our friend back, we'll go
directly to the rendezvous point.
The ship will meet us at midnight
If you have any unfinished business...
- today's the day to do it.
- Joe.
- Why didn't you tell me, Joe?
- Bernie.
- We were gonna--
- Don't you "Bernie" me.
You can all go straight to hell.
Bernie.
Goddamn it, Bernie. Wait a minute.
When were you going to tell me, Joe?
Or were you just going
to let me find out after youíd gone?
I didn't have the heart to tell you
that we were only gonna stay a few days.
I'm sorry, but I was
trying to help you.
Help me? You just yanked the rug
right out from under me.
Do me a favor. Go be a good Samaritan
somewhere else.
You know, Bernie,
you are the most miserable...
Self-centered complainer
I've ever met.
Other people are in pain.
Other people are afraid.
If youíd open your god damned eyes
once in a while, you might see that!
As far as I'm concerned, you can feel
Sorry for yourself until hell freezes over.
You don't deserve to have friends like us.
Here. Here it is. You throw it.
That's the way. Throw it to Mary.
Oh! It's over there now.
Come on. Bring it.
That's a good throw!
There now. That's the way.
Catch it!
Whee!
- Anthony!
- I got it!
- Anthony!
- Oh, no!
Anthony!
Oh, God. No!
Someone, please, call an ambulance!
Joe.
Hello, Bernie.
I went looking for you at the motel.
Ruby told me. I couldn't find the others.
How is she?
Doesn't look good.
Really something the way things work out.
She was so happy to be back here...
And then this happens.
Did you ever tell her?
Tell her what?
That you're sick again.
I've known you over 30 years, Joe.
After you blew up this afternoon...
I figured it out.
Will you get better if you go back?
I got better before.
You don't get sick there.
- Mr. Finley?
- That's me.
Your wife's vital signs
are stable at the moment...
But she's comatose.
I don't expect her to last the night
Iím sorry.
- Can I see her?
- Yes, of course.
Honey?
Can you hear me?
Joe.
Hello, my darling.
What happened? I can't remember.
You were in an accident...
But you're gonna be fine.
I dreamed I--
Something was pulling me
farther and farther away...
And then you came and held me...
and wouldn't let me go.
My God, Joe.
What's happened?
What have you done?
I gave you a present...
Something you needed.
You know, a lot of my life...
I-I've been a selfish son of a bitch.
Oh.
I haven't always taken care of you
the way I should have.
But I always loved you.
I know that, Joe.
I've always known that.
Joe, I can't be without you.
Sure you can.
I want you to take that job.
And anyway...
My time's run out.
Oh, Joe.
Ooh. I am so tired.
I am...
So damn tired.
Then rest, darling.
Go ahead and rest.
Well...
That's the end of an era.
Won't be the same now.
We never should have come back.
If weíd stayed put,
this never would have happened.
Oh, you can't second-guess fate.
You got to take it the way it comes...
Then try and figure out
how to deal with it.
Joe would have liked this.
He loved the beach.
Oh, he didn't give a shit
about the beach.
It was them smooth-legged girls
in them dental-floss bikinis.
That's what he liked.
I'm gonna miss that old son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Me too, pal.
Me too.
She's finally asleep.
Art, honey, can you give me a hand?
I'll be right there.
I think we overdid this.
Half of these things won't fit.
I've been thinking.
Could we be making a mistake?
I mean...
Are we doing right by our child?
Is it fair to take him
that far away?
I know it won't matter
when he's young, but...
What about when he grows up?
Think of what he'll be missing.
All those experiences
we took for granted...
He won't have.
Art, do you really think I hadn't
thought about that?
For all the snowflakes and sunsets
and rainbows he won't see...
Think of what he will have.
Think of what he'll gain--
a world with no illness...
No poverty, no wars.
Besides, if we stay here...
Our child might not be born.
We'd never live long enough
to see him grow up.
Well, it's time we head out.
Be a good boy.
- Take good care of your mother.
- Wait a minute, Grandpa.
Thanks.
- Have a safe trip.
- Bye-bye, now.
Good-bye, Ruby.
Oh, we canít just
leave you here like this.
Please, won't you come with us?
I belong here. I'm gonna
take that job with the children.
- It's what I want.
- You'll be all alone.
What am I, chopped liver?
She'll be fine.
We're gonna miss you...
More than you know.
- Good-bye, Bernie.
- Bye, Art.
Well, I hate these long good-byes.
- So good-bye, my girl.
- Bye-bye.
Bernie, I'm glad I got to see ya.
Me too, Ben.
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Mary.
Hold up.
Bye.
Good-bye. Bye, Bernie. Bye.
Good-bye, honey.
Be careful, Jack.
- Where you goin'?
- Get somethin' to eat.
Hey, bring me back a burger, will ya?
I'm so sorry.
Down by six, right?
Okay.
Come on.
You take the passenger side.
Good evening, Doc. You're workin' kinda late.
Yeah, well, uh, I had
a couple things I had to finish up.
You have a good evening.
- Aw God! Power failure.
- Rebecca, get Engineering.
Right
Damn.
That was weird.
- Oh, my God. Rebecca, get Dr. Baron!
- Right.
He's not in here.
Phil!
- Phil!
- Where the hell would he go?
- Come on. This way.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's check it out.
- Did you see anything?
- This way. This way.
Phil.
Phil, don't run away.
Sara, make sure the building is sealed.
- Donít forget the sea door by the dolphin tanks.
- Right.
Be careful now. Don't frighten him.
There's someone in the building.
Why don't you check out the west wing?
Letís go ìì back to the lab, okay?
- Nothing down that way, sir.
- All right.
All right. We split up here.
Everyone takes a door and stays put.
Nothing gets out of this building.
Doug. Rebecca.
- You, come with me. Come on.
- Yes, sir.
I'll check the central core.
Okay, okay. We'd better move.
Grandpa!
David? Good. Come on. You can help me.
We're gonna have
to do this, son. Take hold.
It's gotta open.
Lean into it!
All right, push, David! Push!
Ah!
I got it, Gramps!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Well, you see, he's my friend...
And we're gonna take him home.
Okay?
Here they come.
Okay.
Did you see anyone, ma'am?
No.
- Ahoy!
- Ho! Welcome back!
There we go.
All right, sir.
There you go.
- There you go, boy.
- Hello, darling.
- Art.
- Barnacle Bill.
- David. What are you doing here?
- Hello, Grandma.
Are you all right? Are you both all right?
- What happened?
- Now Mother, he was a lot of help to me...
and, without him, I wouldn't be here.
- Yeah. I did all right, didn't I, Grandpa?
- Iíll say you did.
Hittin' a baseball will be a cinch after that.
I wish you'd be here to see it.
We will be.
- What?
- Well, hell, that's what you want, isn't it?
- Ben! Oh, thank you, my darling.
- Grandpa.
Thank you
Walter!
- Good to see you, Jack.
- You make one hell of an entrance.
Thank you.
- You've done well.
- He's weak, but he'll survive.
Well, I see the gang's all here.
Not the whole gang.
I know. I'm sorry about Joe.
He was a good man...
And a good friend to all of us.
Well, Ben, are you sure
you won't come with us?
Real sure. I tell ya.
See, Walter, a man's not supposed
to outlive his children.
Oh!
And besides, I may see you
some other time, some other place.
That may be true, Ben.
Well, I think it's time to leave.
You've no idea how we'll miss you.
You'll make a wonderful mother.
You'll make a wonderful grandmother.
Ah!
You wonít forget us, will you?
Forget ya? Ha.
No, we wonít forget ya.
Now, you'd better get goin'.
You'll miss your connection in Baltimore.
I thought you only cried when somebody died.
Or when your friends are leavin'.
Yeah.
I see what you mean. Good-bye, Ben.
Well? Oh. Hey, come here.
I got something here that means a lot to me.
I want you to have it, Kitty.
It's my high school graduation photo.
I got it framed, so you can put it
on the TV or... somethin'.
Thank you. I really love it, Jack.
I'll miss you, Kitty.
- I'll miss you too, Jack.
- I'm sorry. Kitty.
Itís time.
Excuse me.
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you...
But I ran out of gas and you're the only light.
Do you happen to know if thereís
any place nearby where I can get gasoline?
I'll be right with you.
- Yeah. There's an all-nighter...
about a mile down the road.
I can give you a lift if you want.
- Sure you wouldn't mind?
- Oh, no. No problem.
Kinda late to be out, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just
on my way home from work.
This hour?
I wouldn't want your job.
Neither would I. I just quit.
Why are you looking at me that way?
Honestly, this is no line, I swear.
- But I think I know you from somewhere.
- No, I don't think so.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- You look so familiar.
- No. I never forget a face.
I'm sure I'd remember yours.
- My name's Jack. Jack Bonner.
- Sara.
- Nice to meet you, Jack.
- Pleasure.
- It's chilly, isn't it?
- Yeah. Well, you know, down at--
Oh, where's my manners?
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.
Ever been in a glass-bottom boat?
- No.
- Wanna go on one?
- Yeah. I've always wanted to.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Well, I've got one.
- Really?
- Yeah. Well, the bank owns it...
But you're lookin' at a captain
of a glass-bottom boat
A captain?
