"This is Angry Bob, the man with
the industrial dick!"
"Coming at you loud and clear
on W.A.R. Radio."
"Rise and shine folks
it압 a beautiful day."
"Just look at that sky,
it압 a work of art!"
"Nature never knew colors like that.
When you look at it, be sure to wear your shades!"
"The radiation count is way up
and the heatwave ain앖 expected to let up either."
"Wheatercontrol tell us it will probably hit
110 downtown, before nightfall."
"As for the good news...
There is no fucking good news!"
"So let압 rock with one of our golden oldies..."
New York Max,
that압 the place to make it now.
Youre talking 9000 tons of steel, 4000 tons of
aluminium. 5-6 million miles of copperwire.
kitchen appliances, typewriters.
audio gear, tons of autoparts!
Works of art, hanging in the galleries
Just hanging there, waiting to be plucked.
Clothing, tupes, bridgework, false teeth,
prostetic limbs...
You name it, New York has got it all.
No one is going to repopulate The Big Apple,
not with the rat count the way it is.
You know, stuff is just going begging!
Salvage City, Max...You앏l love it.
Don앖 call me Max.
Well, well well. Hard Mo Baxter.
Taking a little vacation?
Is this authorized?
What do you care?
Nothing that comes in here is authorized.
Oh, untrue. I앐 primarily legitimate now...
Maybe we should go elsewhere then Alvy?
No, no, wait untill I get my glasses!
Are you sure? We can go somewhere...
No, no, just wait...
That Alvy...
He kills me every time.
My back.
Christ!
Where is the little man?
He압 indisposed...
You pushing something?
See what his shit is.
Let me see.
Where did you find it?
Glass flats, Judas sea,
looking all over.
I give you 30.
40?
50...Is that alright?
I knew you앇 see it my way.
Merry Christmas.
What the fuck was that?!
A zonetripper.
I았e seen his type...
The whole sea is full of them.
Who was that?
Someone looking for the bathroom, come on!
I put my boot in his ass
and sent him on his way.
Why don앖 he piss in the street,
like everyone else?
Show me!
Where did you get this?!
Out in the zone, what do you think it is?
Probably a maintenance droid.
Stepped on a fragmine I guess.
You think so?
It압 not alot I can do with this.
It압 got good visual circuits, infrared...
Unusual microgear...
I give you 30 c압 cash in hand.
30 c압...You are a generous man
but I think I will hold on to it.
This is junk,
what are you gonna do with it?
It압 christmas eve Alvy, you should know that.
You used to be an elf, didn앖 you?
You can앖 expect me to go back to
my girl empty handed, can you?
You don앖 know my girl...
How much for the other stuff?
10 c압 is as high as I go...
Yep Alvy, your as high as you ever gonna go.
Can앖 help it if mother caught a dose in the big one.
Come on.
You just wait. All those years out in the zone
your kids will make me look like narcissis.
"Hey, hey folks! Rise and shine."
"I got an update here on the conflict we all know and love."
"The deathtoll from last nights violation
of the christmas ceasefire is still rising."
"It currently stands at around 578,
with the counterattack now well underway."
"I send this message of holiday cheer
to all of you:"
"Kill, kill, kill!"
Yo, hey miss Wakowski.
Vernon, the sonofabitch was at my door again.
Who?
I don앖 know. I didn앖 see him, he just keeps ringing my bell.
Then how do you know it압 the same guy?
Vernon, it is.
I couldn앖 see anybody
Yes...that압 what worries me.
Let me speak to Chief
He압 out on his rounds.
Don앖 worry miss Wakowski,
we앏l keep our eyes peeled.
Listen Vernon I...hey!
I았e got a delivery coming up this morning.
Be sure you let him up this time.
Will do.
"As planned, the emergency population control bill..."
"will take affect at midnight, on the first of the year."
"Eager citizens are already lining up
at sterilization centers."
"Wich will be opened around the clock
to aid in the transition"
"to what the President terms:
A clean break from procreation."
"In a related story..."
"The two creators of the population control bill
was found dead yesterday..."
"Ready...on...boil."
You took a beating on that deal man.
That zonehead fell asleep
and you were still jacking up the price.
Well, I just want Jill to be happy.
That압 what I like about you, Max.
Youre a real romantic.
Youre the cabby?
Where you guys going?
Downtown.
You guys like music?
Check these guys out.
Used to be okay down here,
you know that?
Used to be, you could walk
down here any time.
Go out on a saturday night
with just brassknuckles, nothing else.
Maybe a piece of wood, piece of
pipe, you know what I mean.
Nowdays you need a gun all the time.
Fucking bunch of shit, what these people
are doing to the fucking world.
It압 the same every time man. The minute
I앐 back on earth, I wanna be in space again.
Yeah right. Till one of you boosters
blows up under you...
or your heatshield ripps off
on the way home.
Hey, don앖 knock it.
Dying in space is real easy.
One pssst and youre gas...spread
out over a thousand miles of stratosphere.
Jesus man! Think of the view.
No more sitting in a bunker
coughing your guts out.
Waiting for your first cancer cells to show
or kids to be born blind and blue
Because I mean, you have had one trip to many
or caught snake-eyes in a genetic crap game.
Jesus, do you think Jill wants you to go on
wading around up to your arse in...
radioactive iodine for the rest of your life.
Think she liked it better if I ended up
like one of these bums?
Holy shit!
What the hell happened here? This
was a respectable building a few months ago.
Some drugged out joyrider drove
a landcruiser through the security gates.
You just can앖 keep 覆 out.
This place is going to hell.
Christ! They are all over the place.
Somebody ought to help these people...
or clear them out.
They just keep coming back Max.
Nothing압 gonna keep them out except for
sealing this place up like a bunker.
That압 not such a bad idea.
Does she know youre back Max?
I didn앖 want to wake her.
Do you think she is going to let you stay?
Of course she will.
She sleeps better when I앐 around.
Makes her feel more secure.
That압 a laugh man!
She couldn앖 be more secure, then she is now.
She압 sealed in tight!
She doesn앖 need your help.
She doesn앖 stick her little toe out
if she don앖 need to.
How do you know?
I keep an eye on her.
Good...keep it up.
When I앐 not around...
see nothing happens to her.
You았e been away a long time man.
What are you going to tell her?
She understands.
She knows what kind of job I do.
Jill! It압 me, Mo. You home?
Mo?
Are you going to let me in or what?
I changed the code.
She changed the code?
Come on Jill. It압 Mo. I앐 back.
Hey baby.
Hello.
Second level압 low today.
I았e had warmer hellos.
It압 been a while.
Yeah.
How압 it going?
Fine.
How are you?
Pretty good.
Got a job costumizing these consols
for these uptowners.
Welfare checks are coming in...
can앖 complain.
See my new pet? I았e been using it for modeling.
Woke up this morning and made a web.
What you feed it?
Sometimes I catch a bug.
Sucks them dry.
I았e got something else you앏l like.
I았e been basing my work more on
organic forms but...
sometimes by the time I앐 finished
it압 hard to tell.
It압 like I앐 fighting with the metal and...
so far the metal is winning.
It압...very...powerfull.
Thanks Shades.
Jill, I got something for you!
God!
It압 horrible...I love it.
What is it?
Maintenance droid I think.
I picked 覆 up out in the zone. Probably
somekind of new design they are testing out.
Thought you could make an ashtray out of this.
Just look at the workmanship, it압 so beautiful.
Yeah, it is, isn앖 it?
You don앖 look so bad yourself.
Merry Christmas baby.
It압 good to see you Mo.
Spread those lips.
That압 it...oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh that압 it baby.
Take that big dick! Yes.
Take it all the way in, that압 it.
All the way in.
Take it. Suck him dry.
That압 it baby, you got him now.
God, youre beautiful!
Yeah, that압 it baby.
Take that big dick, take it in.
Yeah...oh yes. Yeah.
Take him baby...squeez that tube.
Yeah...come on. Yeah.
Take him, suck it dry.
That압 it...That압 my bitch!
Yeah...squeez it!
Fucking bitch.
God I love you.
Sweet.

God, I wish.
I was dreaming.
I could hear the rain...
on the glass.
And you were laying beside me...
in the dream.
I like it.
Really, I think it압 okay.
Where did you get all the babydolls?
Shades found a whole box of them in the streets.
Well I provided the crowning touch, eh?
Did you hear about the new population
bill they are trying to put through?
No.
They are trying to stop people from
having kids in the next few years.
Gonna levy fines against people
that have to many.
Take away their ration coupons.
Sterilize people who already have...
high enough doses of radioactivity.
It will never work.
It압 our nature to reproduce.

No, I just...think it압 stupid and suicidal

And what is this?
Somekind statement about all that?
No.
Because if it is, I don앖 get it.
You know, what압 the head supposed to mean anyway?
It doesn앖 mean anything!
It압...it압 not for you.
It압 not for anybody.
I guess not. All I앐 saying, is that
it be nice if you could sell something
every once in a while, wouldn앖 it?
Look, I앐 doing alright on my own.
I don앖 need anything from you.
I don앖 know about that.
Goverment takes a pretty big hunk
out of my paycheck every month.
Where do you think your welfare checks
are coming from, eh?
What do you want me to do?
You want me to join your corps?
Think of what our radioactiv kids
will be like then.
I stopped thinking about kids
a long time ago.
You always say that things will change.
Maybe they will.
Oh yeah they will...they will.
They are going to get worse
before they get better.
Survival of the fittest.
You앇 like that, wouldn앖 you?
Oh yeah I like that.
And why not? I앐 one of the fittest.
Keep asking myself why
I let you in everytime.
Why the fuck do I let you in?
Great.
I앏l get it.
No, don앖 answear it!
What are you scared of?
Alvy ?!
I got to see you.
Sorry to call you so late,

You can call me Lincon or Link.
I just wanted to be sure you are alright.
I앐 fine!
Look, my boyfriend is asleep in the other room.
Your boyfriend?
So...I think you better go now!
I don앖 think to much of this boyfriend of yours.
I don앖 see anything going on between you,

It압 really why I came here.
God, get back!
Listen...I know alot about you.
I know things about you, that you
probably don앖 even...admit.
You always been my favorite subject.
Oh Jesus!
Oh, wow! What was that?
There압 a droid running crazy in my lounge.
That압 okay, we can go to my place.
Why wont this work?
Someone압 activated the emergency override,
you can only disengage from the main consol.
How do you now?
I used to be with the surveillance company
that installed all the locks and cameras
in this whole block a few years ago.
That압 how we know each other.
You made me a coffee while I was here.
Black...two sugars?
I don앖 remember.
It압 okay. I don앖 mind.
Now what?
Sounds like something is overloading
the main powerframe.
Well, look Mr...Weinberg.
Lincon...you call me Link, please.
Lincon. Can you get us out of here?
Where압 the main terminal?
It압 in the living room, but you can앖 go in there.
That압 okay. It압 alright, I know what I앐 doing.
Come on, you can trust me.
Keep talking, so I know where you are.
I앐 right here.
Hello in there?!
Man, I bet that android is anywhere...Ouch!
Hey?!
Lincon?!
Lincon?!
It압 okay! I앐 alright!
There압 nothing in here!
What압 his name?
Who압?
Your boyfriends.
Moses.
Moses? Jesus, some name.
He압 not around very much, is he?
You ought to get somebody closer to home.
Somebody, kind of like...a neighbour..
Just fix the frickin' consol, okay!
You smoke alot of dope.
I see you.
Does it get your boyfirend hard or what?
I get people dope sometimes
when they come around to my place
and it gets them hard.
You can stop talking now.
What if I sing? You want me to sing?
I don앖 really care, just get us out of here.
Okay.
Ooo we all walk the wibberly

And we all talk the wibberly
wobberly talk.
Ooo we all wear wibberly

And we look at all the pretty girls
with wibberly wobberly eyes.
I made that up.
Look. I앐 gonna make two things
very clear to you right now:
One...there is no other way out of here, so
that means that droid is still in here somewhere.
And two...
You just want me to leave.
I just want you to open the door.
Why are you so afraid of me?
I앐 not afraid of you.
Two...my boyfriend is in the corps.
He just got back from the zone.
He just went out for a pack of cigarettes.
Any second he is going to walk through that door.
And we don앖 want him to get the wrong idea!
Do we?!
Check! Good thinking.
Okay, this should just about do it.
So we can go?
Er...wait...I앐 just gonna...

You don앖 wanna keep these closed. You won앖
be able to see Santa Clause coming.
Help me!
Check...and mate.
Hey Chief! How앇 you do that?
I didn앖 even see that coming.
Cecilia Momomba.
That압 how you beat computers when you play.
And she don앖 understand sacrifice and

Everything is gonna be alright.
I don앖 care about the money.
I앏l get something together here.
Maybe...maybe you and I should live in
New York. Just the three of us.
Alright Shades. I앐 looking

You never had to come back, did you?
All that bullshit about your contract!
You just wanna be able to leave whenever you feel like it.
Na, na, you don앖 understand Jill.
You don앖 understand.

Hell of a lie wasn앖 it?
No it wasn앖 a lie. It was...
They threw me out Jill.
