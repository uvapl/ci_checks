Yeah, Boss?
Where are you?
I just took a U-turn from Gwang Myung crossroad and I'll be there soon
Guys, show time.
Hyung Tack, Sang Gon take front entrance. Jung Ho, Sang Min cover the stairway.
Yup.
If this guy is cocked up, he can be a real threat so stay close to each other.
Arrh, I said we need a backup, damn it.
Awake now?
Fuck you, I wasn't drowsing.
Hey guys, let's nip it off real quick and
call it a night to the two months long stakeout, uh?
Uh-huh, he's in
Quick
We catch the mother bird and don't bother with baby birds
Make sure you move in when it's feeding
Hello
The food has been transferred
Sir, you shouldn't do this.
Let go... you son of..
Hold it!
Don't move you mother fucker.
Yeah, I've got it.
Yes sir, I will be on my way immediately.
He's on the move
What next?
Are you sure it changed hands?
I saw it!
Than why is he not out yet?
I saw it with my own eyes when he handed over the stuff!
Move in or not. Uh?
If that guy's out of here, we are done!
Boss...BOSS!!
Go!
Come on, son of bitch
Don't move, you shit bag!
You mother fucker!
Catch that guy.
Hold him tight!
Let's make it quick, uh?
We need to write a report before dinner, you know.
Mother fucker
Someone got away with it
It's gone
Someone got away with it
Someone got away with it
Damn it!
Take it easy, mate.
Those mother fuckers really...
Crazy bitch!
Will you stop kneading them, uh?
Wanna make some sushi?
(Pawn shop)
Come out
Wanna die?
I didn't steal the milk, you know.
..wasn't a fib, really...
I don't steal anymore, you know...
Eh? It's flowers!
Youngchul, the boy from rice shop, you know...
I ran into him today and it was a real embarrassment you know...
Kids were asking me if I like him...
why on earth would I like him?
Ah! And look at my teeth. My dog tooth feels loose.
Have you ever pull your teeth?
Ah! And look at my teeth. My dog tooth feel loose.
Have you ever pull your teeth?
Does it hurt a lot?
Mister...
I knew it.
Arh... Why do I need to pull at this grown up age?
I hate to pull my tooth...
Why is it 1,000?
You didn't pay me back 500 last time.
I've a whole lot of new songs downloaded in it, you know.
The songs you listen to are all weird.
That's mean
That
Uh?
Give it back to me.
Eh? Sausage.
I like sausage too, you know.
What do you want to do with the money you make?
Viola!
I'll open up a nail art shop of my own.
I am the best in my class, you know.
You want your nails done by me as well?
These days many men are doing it, you know.
Are you really a gangster?
People say you did something bad and live in hiding here.
Mom also tells me to be careful as you might be a sexual molester
What?
Do you... also think I am a bad guy?
I Just...
think you'd go well behind bars.
Jung Somee, are you in there again?
It's mom! I am not here, OK?
Mister!
Open this goddamn door!
Hey Mister, is Somee with you?
She didn't come.
I heard her voice, damn it.
If she's not here, why are you blocking the room with the door?
Jung Somee, I know you are there.
Get your ass out there right now!
Pull the door, I said.
Open up, will ya?
Mister, what the hell are you doing?
Jung Somee, I'm going to give you a good kick in the ass
if you don't come out right now.
What the...
She is not with you?
I am warning you, mister.
Don't you keep asking my girl to come here, got it?
If you ever do anything weird to Somee,
you'll have to deal with the consequences
I may forgive bastards, who fuck married women,
but I'll never forgive sickos that touch children
I will rip their balls off
If you are lonely, you could ask me out, you know
You don't look so bad, and I might even feel like making love with you. Uh?
Chicken!
Beautiful, isn't it?
Don't touch things that are not yours.
Are you smiling?
Tell your boss that I will kill him once I catch him
Day and night... have a fucking ball doing your service.
After fucking up with my good, you think I'd take you
to a detective to get it back? You stinking mother fucker!
I have guys out looking for it.
If I find out who fucked with me...
This is why I can't trust guys in log business.
Jesus, have a look at that two bit-hood bastards from the developing republic. For fucking sake.
Who brought in that thick headed clueless bastard here?
Fucking Viet Cong.
1.6 billion Chinese are smoking Marijuana;
26 millions are taking Methan Betamin; 11 million are doing Heroin.
An outright bonanza. U.N. says so, you see?
Three days... we can only hold the Chinese guys for three days!
If you can't redeem the sample Heroin by then,
you and your brother will be on Human Body Revealed exhibition.
Since you guys deal with human meats, you know perfectly well what I mean.
The only way this country can stand tall again is to confine
these shit heads in a concentration camp. Like the one during Kwangju massacre.
Fucking bitch!
Are you crazy?
Where did you stash away the stuff?
Aren't you going to answer?
I am the one who went through all the trouble...
I am entitled to the half of it. Aren't I?
Fucking whore
Listen, slut... 80/20 is not a bad deal at all.
So cut the crap and bring it in by tomorrow.
My ass!
Who will find me if I sell it off and disappear?
You must be looking forward to hell.
Do you realize who they are?
Think wisely, stupid bitch
Like mother, like daughter. Fuck!
Go. Play outside.
I mean it. Once mom's friends are gone, I'll go home.
Do you know what your nickname is?
A pawnshop ghost. Heh...
Guess what my nickname is.
What is it?
I won't let you know.
Garbage can.
My aunt told me that when my mom was pregnant, she kicked
a garbage can and broker her toe. Since then, I am a garbage can.
Funny, isn't it?
Go to sleep.
Pawnshop Ghost and Garbage Can...
Sounds like some internet ID names, isn't it?
Arrr... wish I could play a computer game.
-It had to be a rough job because there is no proper materials~~
Hope you still find it cute ^^ -
What a naughty devil!
What's your mom's mobile phone number?
Arent you going to answer me?
Please stop hitting her. You may really hurt her.
Can't you see my child is hurt?
I am a dutiful tax payer, but what are you guys doing living off my tax?
Allowing these little beggars to wandering around freely.
What was that dirty look for?
Did your mother teach you to look at people like that, huh?
Come here...
Did you steal that bag?
I didn't steal the bag...
I just wanted to see how it is different from mine.
You don't have a bag, you beggar.
I told you not to touch her. She's full of germ.
You see? We need your parents to settle this.
Don't you have a mom?
Your dad?
Look... mister.
Mister...
Excuse me... look!
Isn't he your dad?
Hello.
Where are you?
Oh ho ho...Judging from the low key of your voice, I reckon you were rebuked like hell
The older brother is going through the shit hole
while the younger one is having a feast. What an exemplary family it is, uh?
Take it easy. Life is simple, you know.
I got a call from Tochi.
Found out about the bitch who stole our stuff
Who?
The dancer?!
Are you mad at me?
Told you... you should steal other people's stuff.
How much is the things she just took off with?
Never mind...
Stealing is a part of growing up.
Giving a birth just doesn't make one a parent, does it?
The poor thing is always alone by herself
You should take her out with you more often.
It was free of charge, alright?
Give me back my MP3
Since I don't have any money with me, I'll give you this instead.
My treasure card. It beats everything.
Good bye, sir.
Mister... you also embarrassed about me, right?
That's why you pretended not to know  me, wasn't it?
It's alright though.
My class mates feel the same. So do the teachers.
Mom also told me if I ever get lost,
I should pretend to not know our address or phone numbers.
Every time she gets drunk, she keeps saying we should kill ourselves together.
You are worse than the fat son of s bitch who calls me a beggar.
Still, I don't hate you.
If I come to hate you, there's not a single person I like in this world.
If I keep thinking about that, it really hurts here.
So, I'm not going to hate you.
Mom?
Mommy...
There's a stuff we are looking for.
You'd better help us, mate.
Ah..fuck... who you do you take me for?
A bully in the alley?
Go!
Have you got it?
Ummm... the situation just got somewhat complicated
Who are you?
If you wanted to rob a pawn shop, you've got a wrong target.
I didn't call police so just get lost.
Uh, fuck... ain't this a fucking cool guy
Okay!  Return our goods back, and we will be gone.
It was pawned yesterday by a bitch named Park Hae Jung
A camera bag. Give it back.
Pawn shop takes half a month interest even for a day.
The principle 80,000 Won plus interest 1,600 Won.
The goods are returned upon payment in person.
Oh! Really, sir?
Didn't know that.
But, how can we resolve the issue...
Hey, tell him.
Mom! Stop it! Stop that! Don't!
Mom, are you okay? Mom?
Mom, wake up.  Mom... mom
You see, she is regrettably not in a condition to do so.
How much? They are about to kiss this world goodbye, you know.
Fuck..
Mister....Mister!
Help me!.... Mister!
Mister.....
You mother fucker...
Couldn't even deal with an old timer..
Was it what? Boxing, Yawara or Karate kinda thing or what?
Please boss. You should have seen him yourself really.
He was way too quick. I couldn't even see his hand moving, damn it.
Hey, wasn't he some...
Errhh. forget it... fuck!
That's OK.
Yeah, it's good. I needed a thrower anyway.
So a woman and her daughter that live next door
got kidnapped. And it is a drug crime?
Yes.
Is she your neighbor for sure?
Ah.. never mind. Just give me the address.
We'll have a nearest precinct contact you.
Hello!? You can't give me your address, can you?
Listen, if you are that lonely, why don't you call 114 instead?
Girls there have far sexier voices.
Stop bothering busy people like us in the middle of night!
I'll do whatever you want me to do. Just don't hurt those two.
That was very wise of you. All you need to do is to pass on a thing to someone.
How's that?
Not a bad build.
Open the glove compartment.
(Out of order)
Go to Dalak Golf driving range and ask for Mr. Oh.
Hand it over at 6 o'clock sharp. Be punctual, mate.
As soon as you hang up, throw away the phone.
When will you letting them go?
There's a famous dumpling soup restaurant, you know.
Bet you haven't been there before, uh?
I've booked three persons at 9 o'clock there. Go and look it up, kiddo.
Hey, auntie. How come only petty criminals, huh?
I don't see a single homicide case here..
Fuck you.
Fuck me.
Drug squad, Rho speaking
Yeah?
-Practicing Chinese words-
Welcome. This way please.
Please.
(In Chinese- Nice to meet you.)
Is it right?
Yes sir.
Please have a seat. ha ha
(translator repeating in Chinese)
Was he alone?
Yes, sir.
Wow... Mainland guys have no fear, huh?
What about Oh?
Have sent Namnang.
What are you waiting for?
Tell him I've brought it in from Shen Yang.
Not sure if he'd find it to his taste.
Politely, got it?
Yes sir.
(In Chinese- This tea is from Shen Yang, China. Please try it)
Please.
He must have watched lots of gangster movies in China.
Dressed up in all black. Is he attending a funeral? ha ha.
Shall I translate that?
You don't want to live?
Son of a bitch... afraid I poison the drink.
Want me to drink it first, uh?
Are you Mr. Oh Myung Kyu?
I kept my part of the bargain.
Let those two go.
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?
What about Oh?
I passed it on exactly as required.
Keep the promise.
What the hell is he talking about?
Did you got the good, mate?
Man Suk?
Are you snitching on me?
If not, should I watch my whole business go down your throat?
You thought you'd get away with this?
Mr. Oh. Born in '58, year of the dog, Oh Myung Kyu, you mother fucker.
Let me tell ya this, uh.
No matter how well you kiss the asses of prosecutors and judges,
you are in for 20 rounds, get it? Mother fucker!
If you wanna live, better start running, you stinking mongrel mother fucker!
Mongrel~
You, Chinese lit major.
You've just blown your part time job payment
Bastard
Hold him
Arhh... fuck. What a mess, damn it.
Just throw him to the cops.
Quickly... this way
What the fuck
Fuck
Lee Gwang Su
Joo Dae Young
Kim Bo Sung
Whoever drops it on the floor will get his ass kicked good.
If anyone caught adding water to his piss, he will regret it, all understood?
You fucking son of bitches. Not a single bastard replies.
No small talks.
No swapping the piss.
You've heard it clear and loud?
You've heard it clear and loud?
No organs?
Yes
Cornea, kidney, liver, heart. All high prices organs have been completely taken out.
Log dealing is not Oh Myung Jyu's style, son
Who the hell is he?
He popped out from nowhere.
Checking his identity. So far no connection with Oh Myung Kyu is found
This was hidden inside the boiler
Too little
Already gone
Uh?
Name Cha Tae Shik
21, Dongja-dong, Yong San-ku, Seoul
No drug dealing record.
Negative to a doping test
Urh... anyway, this guy has no record whatsoever between 98 and 06
No record?
Cancelled resident registration is nothing new to these guys.
Start from the last known record, and find the connection to Oh Myung Kyu.
Remember this is a homicide case.
21 Dong Ja-dong, Yong San-ku
pawn shop?
A splotch was found inside this woman's nose
Do you understand what it means?
Her eyeballs were taken out while her heart was beating
While she was very much alive the eyeballs were pulled out, god damn it.
Drug is not an issue with you, you know.
If you keep insisting on taking the fifth like this,
you will rot in the shit hole for good, you understand?
Eh...detective..
Don't we get a night meal?
What? Meal? You don't fucking get it, do you?
Who's Cha Tae Shik?
What is it?
I couldn't access his record. It was locked.
Locked?
This is phone record of Oh Myung Kyu with his close associates.
Pass it on to the captain, and tell him to see me when he is back.
He's at the site and wouldn't be back soon
Damn..
Here, here...let's continue after a meal, eh? Look..
I am left handed.
Wow... hunger wins, eh?
Now you open your mouth, good gracious.
Really, I like that kind of attitude.
Let's finish this up quickly after eating, OK?
Hello?
What is this? Who the hell are you?
I am the part time job student at the scene..
All I did was asking for a meal, really...
Where's detective Park?
Put detective Park on!
Please save me!
Young man.
Can you read the license plate over there?
What?
Help me to see if it's my son's van. I can hardly see it.
What's the number.
Yeah. It's 5124 alright!
<i><b>Subtitle by Aldi Arman</b></i>
Let's go see your mom
Come on up.
What about mom?
You don't come up, you don't see your mom.
Open up, please
Grandma, please let me out. Please
Open up please.
41 minutes.
43 minutes
45 minutes 18 seconds
Jun Ho's whole teeth got broken and detective Kwon's knee joint went kaput
This bastard is fucking complicated
The block code of lock on Cha Tae Shuk's background record was 011
Guess where
Military Intelligence
Not a political figure. I've never seen a civilian has his record locked before.
It's fucking interesting
There's a way to break the lock, you know.
What do you say?
You remember the Ono case? An elementary school kid here
sent an e-mail to the president of USA, you see.
Saying, "I Kill You"
The FBI guys there requested us for an investigation
Naturally, guys with many skeletons in their closet are full of questions.
What you are saying is..
We send the same message using Cha Tae Shik name
Afterward, they will ask for our investigation request. That's it
National Intelligence Service wouldn't have any option but to declassify the information
Obama... Obama?
Is Obama you friend, idiot? We are just sending it to the White House.
What? Go?
Stop?
Don't kill me please.
Whatever it takes.
Don't kill me please.
Don't kill me please.
It's true. The bitch... the mother fucking whore talked me into it!
That's how it got started...
Korean bastards only act once confronted
It took Olympics to have them build bridges and stadiums, you know.
How could it possibly not collapse?
I just wanted to have some fun with the bitch. Nobody is behind this...
Son of a bitch
Then what the fuck is the pawnshop guy?
He's with you, isn't he?
What pawnshop?
Count up to three.
I cut your dick off and squeeze your balls out. One.
P..p..please forgive me..
Two.
Please, don't kill me. Please forgive me.
Let me live, please. No..No.
You just made my heart leap into my mouth, god damn it!
Why the fuck waste time like that?
Dinner's here. Eat!
Will you please turn on the bloody blinker when you move in, for god sake!
The pawn shop guy smells
Think about it, why did he listened, and not call the cop?
Don't give a shit.
What about Oh?
I sent Namnang.
Alone?
It's a fucking brand new Dolce and Gabbana. God damn it..
Alone again?
Uh
I said don't let him act alone
That pervert just likes to play alone
Let me live, uh?
This once, please let me live.
I'll pay you far more than Man Suk and Jong Suk
Uh? Please spare me this once.
If we refine the philophon melt inside this, we can live like emperor!
Uh?
Here it came, here it is.
The daughter of the dead woman was running errands for Cha Tae Shik
She came here often. No relationship between the killed Park Hae Jung and Cha Tae Shik
Having the kid as a drug runner. The puzzle fits. Perfect. Game's over.
Having the kid as a drug runner. The puzzle fits. Perfect. Game's over.
And cut up the belly his woman, then pulled her eyeballs out of the socket?
Would Cha Tae Shik do that?
Isn't it?
That girl called Somee. Still nothing on her whereabouts?
Who cares about her? Everybody is up to the neck because of Oh Myung Kyu things.
It's up
Cha Tae Shik
Forget the fucking mike. How many guys do you see here?
Ah! Yes, sir.
This information on Cha Tae Shik was sent from USA to our investigation office
Cha Tae Shik. A former agent for a special OP military intelligence body called UDU.
We presumed he had carried out many covert missions from 1998 till 2006.
Also, he was a specialized martial art instructor...
...which is known to be quite lethal.
As you can see, he received couple of the highest honor medals for his service.
You two need to help each other.
You guys need to cross guarantee each other.
This man is quite a delinquent borrower...
His main missions including disturbing enemy's rear lines, VIP assassination,
bombing, kidnapping, and more. Mostly special covert missions, I'd say.
So, how much do you need?
That was sold from here, wasn't it?
I am afraid you misunderstood something
This is a loan office, not a telecommunication service.
Just name the guy who bought it. You won't get hurt
What are you? A cop?
The training has been kept secret to outsider. Extremely brutal.
Even watching the drill is not for a faint of heart
He usually buys 20 phones at a time. He's doing log business
Transacting livers, kidneys and other body organs.
After being hospitalized from a car accident in 2006,
no more official record of Cha Tae Shik available from then on.
Gunshot wound?
Unlike the other victim that was in his car,
Cha Tae Shik was transferred to a military hospital
According to the file by the military surgeon,
they treated his wound for a gun shot and not a car accident.
Who the fuck is this mystery guy really?
Who was the other victim of the car accident?
His wife, Kim Yeon Soo
Killed on spot
Just received an information on Cha Tae Shik.
Ah... where are you now?
Yes, but this is not like buying shoes or something.
We need to meet in person
You cannot extend life by swallowing down some pills, you know.
Yeah, get the examination report, so that we can talk seriously.
Hold it, love. That's not the way to light the cigarette
Ever heard the sound of this, sweetheart?
Here, bottom's up.
Here we go. Cheers!
After we find this man, the loan contract will be destroyed, right?
Just let me know where he is.
Uh huh, yeah. He just crossed the Yang Hwa bridge a few minutes ago.
His cell phone was also traced from the area.
Be careful!
Good evening, sir.
Uh-huh
First time here, I presume?
Chicks are hot here, you know.
This place is about as risqué as it can get, you know
Tonight, it looks not so good at all somehow...
although I used to hit on many hotties here..
What's the matter with this place today?
Not so good at all.
Let's move
Where's Tochi?
I got it, I got it. Damn it.
erhh, suffering chronic constipation.
Come this way, please.
Ah... dialysis.
Once started, even going across the street can be quite a labor.
Since you are looking for a kidney for your wife, I will give you a special deal.
Religion?
Eh?.. Religion?
Make it look like a voluntary donation in a religious group
is a part of the laundry process. It will take about two months, anyway.
Are you hot?
You are sweating like hell.
No, erh..I am.. fine.
Hello?
Yes.
I am.. at the men's room
Yes.
Yes.
Who...?
It's a...friend.. of mine..
Friend who?
Mister, here!
Here.
Fucking son of a bitch.
I'll not ask twice.
Where is Somee?
Fuck.. you..
You sold Somee to that ant tunnel?
I know nothing about it. Man Suk and Jong Suk, they know.
Where are they?
OK....OK..
Eh? uh-huh... ah ha... shit...
Oh, shit!  You really surprised me, asshole.
Hey pawnshop. Weren't you supposed to be locked up?
Why did you kill Somee's mother?
Kill? Who did that? asshole
Three people got the new lives out of the slut's body.
Besides, you delivered the body so it's as if you killed her, isn't it?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello
Did you do the same to Somee?
I was told the kid's stomach was not ripe enough for her organs to have any product value.
Her corneas are still good for sale though.
They're not so cheap, you know.
Why don't you just do five years pal?
Who knows? She might be waiting for you with tofu in her hand when you get out.
You guys live for tomorrow only, don't you.
What?
Guy living for tomorrow have no chance against a guy living today only
What the fuck are you talking about, bozo?
I only live for today.
And how terrible it can be....I'll show you.
Hey, this nut head just hung up the phone.
Transfer the case to NIS, is that it?
Despite the information provided, the drugs are gone and the suspect ran away.
Can't go on like that, as you may agree.
Investigation records and Oh Myung Kyu case files should be handed over.
Mr. Song is the prosecutor in charge, right?
I went to college with him.
Let's settle this as quietly as possible.
Fuck you! Cut the bullshit and kiss my ass.
Which one is the guy you want? Oh Myung Kyu or Cha Tae Shik?
We live and sweat together for two months long.
We were the one staking out, and ended up in hospital.
I will sack these guys with my own hand... sir.
Whoever standing in my way will have to knock me down first.
Even if it costs my badges. God damn it.
You are quite dense, detective.
In 2006, an employee at an institute under Ministry of Defense
tried to sell out our satellite data
It was a 2 trillion Won's worth national secret smuggling case
The order to the special OP team was to cut off the smuggling route and retrieve the data
Agent Moon Dalseo was in charge of infiltration.
Agent Cha Tae Shik's mission was to wipe out the smugglers.
It was a success, but a tragic accident followed.
So beautiful!
I am so proud of our baby.
So proud that I can't stop the tears.
Let us hug together.
Three of us.
Thank you and bye.
Thanks.
Sir!
Cha Tae Shik!
Sir!
Cha Tae Shik, look at me. What are you looking at?
Cha Tae Shik...Call an ambulance. Hurry!
Cha Tae Shik...Call an ambulance damn it.
Cha Tae Shik, stay still..don't struggle, damn it.
No!!...
Do I need to ask what it is about?
Get me a gun, please.
Your very first word to me in three years is that?
Not Colt or Tokarev. Get me a semi-automatic with more than 10 rounds of magazine
Get some sleep.
You've got over 40 degree fever.
Bringing back abandoned dog home one at time.  And now there are so many.
Not sure if I am a junk shop guy or a kennel man
Had the bullet hit you a centimeter higher, you would have been dead
Don't do it.
I have no idea what it is about but don't do it.
There's a person I have to find
Only few days, but can't remember the face already.
Should have took a picture.
She withdrew 8 million Won! 8 million!!
A 2nd grader did it. Does it make sense? Uh?
It was Nam Sung Shik account, the boyfriend of Park Hyo Jung.
It matches with that guy's statement
Mister?
Listen mister, please tell them I haven't done anything wrong
Hey, Cha Tae Shik.
Kim Chung Won at drug squad here.
I was hunting you down. Remember me, uh?
I'll come to conclusion first.
You are mine
Still, let me ask you one thing.
You know the daughter of Park Hae Jung, Jung Somee.
Are you looking for her?
She's alive, dude.
She withdrew cash from the Kasan branch of Woori bank yesterday.
You'd better tell me everything
Otherwise, you'll never find Jung Somee
Man Suk, Jong Suk
What?
The delivery I've made to Oh Myung Kyu,
and the death of Somee's mom were all their deeds.
That's all I know.
Who was the broker working under Man Jong?
Jamg Doo Shik.
Check the whereabouts of Jang Doo Shik and comb Chinatown
Taste good?
Tell Man Jong I am bringing in the kid
Now, say good bye
Bye!
Are you going home, sis?
You must behave if you want to go home like her. Understood?
Let's go
Sis...
Bye!
Ah!..Thanks.
It's true, isn't it?
If I behave, I would see my mom, right?
- Out of order -
Hey, Jang Doo Shik!
What? What?
Who are you?
Who am I? Fuck you, asshole. I'm Jesus.
As I am going to let you walk.
Here! He's beating a crippled man! Crippled!!
Nothing.
Stand up!
Up your ass!
You are to run to the chicken cage van (prisoner escort van). Run! Run!
Left, left, left right left.
I really don't know.
Half of the guys are in the cell. Another half guys are in hiding.
Who'd get in touch with us?
She's the missing girl.
Man Jong, do they sell kids as well these days?
Are you telling an old story?
They are more than capable of doing such thing
But it's not what you think it is.
I can see clearly that this is an ant, you know... ant?
Ant?
Ant.
- Out of order -
It's a method used by the Black Society, the Chinese mob
Yeah, Black Society, you know.
Debtors that could not repay the mobs are brought in together
with their children. They use their kids to collect payment
and run drug errands. No one would suspect them
It costs far less and is almost undetectable. A perfect solution
Working in several small groups, they're not easy to trace back
Look, mister!
Mister!
302. 302!
Stop there!
Hands up!
Stop!
Stop!
Damn... flippy little brat.
Hey, this one does not look good. Take her out.
What are you rats looking at? Keep working.
You know I am busy. What is it?
Hello?
Somee
Bring her here
Pawn shop?
How did you find out the place, uh?
Bro!!!
Who was that?
There'll be no second negotiation.
Bring Somee here within an hour
I am asking you mother fucker.
Who was that?
You really don't have an idea who we are, do you?
If you even touch his hair, I will take out
the little bitch's eyeball and the whole bowl
You mother fucker!
Tell Nam No Han to take out the eyeballs of the girl called Somee.
What are you doing?
When kids are dead, you took their organs out.
Liver sent to the west coast.
Eyes to the east coast. Heart to Seoul
Right?
I didn't do that
Those poor little ones. Couldn't even close their eyes with such cruel deaths...
Did it ever occur to you, even once?
On the other hand, have you ever thought about what their bodies worth?
Even their own parents abandoned them
It's a win-win deal
Isn't it?
Wrong
You... at this moment...
... should have apologized to the kids
Ah-hey, fuck you, bastard!
If anything happens to me, you'll never see the girl again
Once I have Somee with me
You two are dead
Hello?
Hello!
If you made a call, say what you have to say, damn it!
Take this
Time to go to mom
Where is my mom, sir?
Mom?
Mommy is here.
I took her heart out.
Therefore, your mommy is here, uh!
Well... hand shake!
What? you don't want to?  Huh?
You told me you'll let me see my mom.
Lie. It was a lie, wasn't it?
My mom's not dead. She's not dead, right?
My mom's alive, isn't she?
Mister, my mom is not dead. It's a lie, isn't it?
Mister, my mom is alive, isn't she?
Where is she? Let me see her, please mister..
Everybody stay still!
Please cooperate.
Have a look
Granny. We know everything
Where are kids?
What the fuck... I said, where the hell are kids!?
Detective!
How is it?
We've got the name. Oh Sang Man.
In prison for 3.5 years for taking drug after
opening a surgical clinic. Nickname, 500 persons.
Find out where this psycho maniac is right now
Alone?
Is that you?
What are you?
What is that kid to you anyways?
A neighbor
A neighbor?
You are a complete nutcase aren't you?
Where is Jong Suk?
Somee first
Take this
Move away, jackass!
Uh-huh, I am scared to get near you, dude.
Catch it, will ya?
Strike!
She went to heaven looking for her mommy
But, she can't find her mommy cause she got no eye
You've messed with wrong man, dude.
A neighbor? Who do you think we are, you mother fucker?
Where is my little brother?
Where is my brother?!
How many cavities do you got?
What?
I run a pawn shop
I take gold teeth
Except for your gold teeth, I will chew on everything else
Where the hell did he get the gun?
A cop? What took you so long? Hurry up!
I just got shot.
You won't die, stupid. Hurry up!
Get in quick, asshole!
Police? There's murder here!! Get your ass over here now!
You idiot, locate my phone's GPS!
Here! He's here. Hurry up you mother fucker!!
You guys here yet? Here? Ooh--uhhh
This is bullet proof window, mother fucker!
Shoot as you like, mother fucker.
You are done when the cops are here, mother fucker.
I am not getting out!
It's bullet proof, you fucking idiot!
I still have one more round
Mister
Mister!
Mister, are you here to save me?
It's true, isn't it? You've come to save me, haven't you?
Don't come.
You'll get blood on you.
You've come to save me, haven't you?
You have, haven't you? Uh?
This bastard got his own eyes taken out.
Put her with him
I have a favor to ask of you.
Little one. You are in a big trouble this time.
I am sorry
I am sorry that I turned away from you back then
When you want to get close to someone,
sometimes you pretend as if you don't know the person.
What does that mean?
I don't know either
This is the first time I see you smile
You stand alone, you know.
You can do it, can't you?
Just once this time,
For just once, let me hug you.
Let me hug you once, if you don't mind.
Are you crying?
