Meet you at the bottom.
Wait. This isn't a race,
we're looking for caves.
Land Sat images are consistent
with Speliogenesis...
...Yeah... yeah... consistent
with Spellio Jellio.
I'm not kidding.
I could have been a lawyer. Woooohooo.
Me gusta tus grandes cahones.
Well at least your
Spanish is getting better.
Rocks!
You okay?
I think so... it's my harness.
It feels loose...
Oh shit, Michelle!
Michelle, you okay?
Yeah...
Anything broken?
No. I'm okay.
Hold on, I'm coming to get you!
What... Oh my god!
This is amazing.
Yeah, then you're going
to want to see this.
At ease.
Welcome to Los Angeles, gentlemen,
and the Western home of Naval Research.
Stow your gear, use the head,
and we'll muster in
the Ready Room at 1500.
Dismissed!
Seal Team. Dismissed!
Lieutenant. You did good work in Angola.
Thank you sir. What's
this all about, sir?
Well, you're here because of
the delicate nature of this mission.
That, and because you're the best search
and rescue team we've got.
Pardon me sir, but, search
and rescue? Here, sir?
Fifteen hundred hours.
Aye, sir.
Hey Jones, your sister
say anything about me?
That clock is incorrect.
My name is Frank Reno,
I'm the Program Director here,
and I've been with the Navy
since before you were born.
Since before Jesus was born.
Doctor Reno is a civilian, SES-5,
that is a rank equivalent of an Admiral.
Which means keep your
goddamn mouths shut.
Thank you, chief. Go ahead Doc.
I graduated from MIT in 1942,
I wanted to do my part
in the war effort,
but the Navy wasn't interested
in a 12 year old recruit.
Fortunately, they had
other plans for me.
I couldn't even drive myself to base
and there I was working
with the greatest minds
and theoretical physicists,
on what would become
the most important discovery in history.
You may not be aware,
but the US Military was already
experimenting with stealth technology.
We called it...
The Philadelphia Experiment.
It's been called that.
But the official, unofficial name was,
Project Rainbow.
We were attempting to
use electromagnetic radiation
to bend light around an object.
We were trying to make
our ships invisible to the enemy.
Instead we stumbled upon
something far more powerful.
In July of'43,
the US Eldridge was docked in
a Philadelphia Naval Shipyard,
when all of a sudden
it just disappeared.
At around the same time,
that same ship was spotted
off the coast of Norfolk,
Virginia by a Merchant Marine vessel,
some 370 miles away.
Most of the crew vanished completely
and 5 of them were actually fused to
the various bulkheads and
decks of the ship itself.
Leaving many people, however,
to believe that the government
actually discovered teleportation.
Not quite.
The Eldridge didn't move at all,
at least not through space.
The position of the ship didn't change,
but the position of the Earth did.
A Rainbow device actually
sent the Eldridge
8 hours backwards through time.
We're talking about time travel here?
Indeed. After the war,
the program was moved here,
where experimentation continued.
By 1949 I was in charge of the program
and eager to take it to the next level.
So on 29 November of that year,
I sent a team of scientists and sailors,
including my older brother, Erik,
through the time portal.
But the system, my system,
for bringing them back, didn't work
and 19 men and 2 women
were stranded 70 million
years in the past.
70 million years?
You didn't think a couple
of weeks were enough?
We were trying to be careful.
There was a great deal of debate
about creating temporal paradoxes...
Like if you went back in time
and killed your
grandfather sort of thing.
Yes, so I chose a time
well before human history
to minimize the chances of
adversely affecting the present.
I've spent the last 59 years
trying to correct my mistake
and improving technology
to safely rescue the people
I sent to their deaths.
Excuse me sir,
what makes you think
they even survived the transportation?
We weren't sure, until
a couple of weeks ago,
when a team of archaeologists
discovered a series of cave paintings
in Western Argentina.
Electro-carbon analysis
dates these paintings
at between 64 and 76 million BC.
Yeah, but that doesn't prove that
those are your guys...
This is not your fault.
Lights please.
Welcome to the Rainbow Room.
Everything you see here,
controls the mechanics
of the Rainbow device
which is buried beneath us.
117
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,664
What is it?
Basically, a mile long Beryllium tube.
We discovered in Philadelphia...
that by applying
electro-magnetic energy,
we could create a tachyonic
field inside the tube
that spins at close to
the speed of light.
After that it was just
a matter of gravity.
To do what?
To open a wormhole.
The theory of general relativity
allows the possibility of
closed time like curves,
through which an object can move to
any point within that curve.
When the Rainbow Device
reaches maximum velocity
the path between two points
in a curve is created.
The gravitational pull of an object
dropped into the singularity
creates a passage through space time.
Look, I could sit here
and try to explain quantum mechanics,
CTL's and Mankowski space theories,
but I believe you would be bored,
and you still wouldn't understand it.
The bottom line is,
it's a surprisingly simple process,
but the difficulty has been in
calculating the space time relation.
'When' hasn't been nearly as
big a problem as 'Where'.
That is until the cave
paintings were found.
Why not just go back sixty
years before they left?
First, there's still the
concern about paradoxes,
and second, it's impossible to pinpoint
the exact moment the team was sent.
I'm confident however,
that we can come within a few months
or years that they disappeared.
We?
I'm going back with you,
I never make the same mistake twice,
and I won't send others
in my place again.
Besides, you'll need me to reopen
the portal on the other side.
It's an extraordinary
mission, gentlemen.
More dangerous than anything
you've ever done before,
and I will not order
any of you to accept it.
If you don't want to do it,
there will be no questions asked.
Fuck it. We're in.
Write your letters to your families,
get your affairs in order.
Dismissed. Get some rest.
You leave at 0300 hours.
Is everyone ready?
Men are good to go.
The Eldridge Sailors reported headaches
and nausea after the experiment,
so we're giving you Scopolamine
for motion sickness,
and a strong N-Sed for pain.
The oxygen levels during
the cretaceous period...
are half of what they are today.
So we're also taking Diamox,
an altitude sickness
medicine, to help us breathe.
Take your fucking pills.
Initiate Temporal Sequencing.
One second sir.
Ready.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Alright, ladies.
This is just another search
and rescue operation,
let's mount up.
Fuck it.
Alright, let's go, go, go.
Move it, jump in there.
Assholes and Elbows ladies,
look alive, move it
out SEAL Team. Move it!
You okay there, doc?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
SEAL Team, sound off!
Burke!

You guys alright?
We got Stubbs and Phoenix?
Stubbs! My rich! Stubbs! My rich!
Stubbs!
Yeah!
You alright?
Fuck!
Alright, let's saddle up.
We need to get to higher ground.
You can't just leave him here.
Burke! You're on point! Let's move!
Thank god it isn't damaged.
What does it do?
it keeps the wormhole
open on the other side.
As long as we have
this, we can get back.
So, doc, this is Argentina, huh?
it will be.
Right now it's the southern
part of a continent...
called Bandana.
That's it.
What?
The mountain,
where the cave paintings were found.
Nah, it's too small.
Ah, plate tectonics, it's
been almost 70 million years.
It's herbivorous, it won't bother us.
Here, let's go.
Alright men, you heard the man.
Let's beat feet, ladies.
Hey, I think he likes you.
Ha-ha, right in your face.
Alright, stow it, stow it.
Pry, you alright?
Pryzicki! No! Get him out of the water!
No! No! Pryzicki!
Get him out of the water!
Move it, men!
Paddle, move, get out of the water!
Move it! Hurry up!
Alright ladies, that's our warning!
Now let's move out!
I'm not losing any more fucking men.
Move it!
- Come on, doc.
- Yeah!
Now let's get out of here.
What's the problem, Burke?
I don't want to get eaten.
Jesus Christ, keep it together!
Now let's move!
What's the problem, petty officer?
I don't know, sir, I saw something,
there's something out there, sir.
Alright. Don't shoot me.
There's nothing out here.
Jesus Christ, Burke,
we're not going to get eaten.
Holy shit!
Lieutenant, Lieutenant!
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
Move team, move! Move it, move it!
Fall back, everybody move, let's go!
Hold your fire.
You're wasting ammunition.
Burke! !
Jesus, how do those
things move that fast?
There's more than one of them.
...and they're picking us off.
Fuck this, I'm out of here.
Manriquez, no! Get back! Manriquez!
Manriquez!
Wait, wait!
Jones!
Move! Move!
Hang in there soldier!
Alright, circle him up, circle him up!
Get ready, get ready!
Lopes! Lopes!
Well, shoot the goddamn thing, will ya?
No! No!
Ruth? Ruth? Ruth! Yes, Yes!
Press here.
We're not leaving without you,
we're not leaving without you, sir.
Stubbs, get out of here, go!
Officer Stubbs. What
are you looking for?
They always hunt in pairs.
Bud, look who's here, look who's here.
Chief Stark.
Well, I reckon you could
still call me Bud, Doc.
What happened here?
Betty, what happened to him?
Come on, we've got to get the others...
We're the only ones left.
Out of 21?
3 never made it through the portal,
and the rest, well...
it's a dangerous place.
You came back, you came back!
How long has it been?
We have to get this man, all of us,
back to the entry point.
Big Red's going to scent the kill.
Okay.
All of us. Back to the entry point.
Hey, hey, who's... who's Big Red?
Hey, is this stuff potable?
Well I hope so,
we've been drinking it
for the last 6 years.
You've been here 6 years?
Well, give or take,
I forgot to bring my calendar, Doc.
Dromas wipe their claws
in their own faeces.
lf the initial attack doesn't kill,
the inevitable infection
will. I'm sorry.
Manriquez, leave me.
Run!
Let's go, people! Let's go! Move!
Come on! We have to go
now! Come on, move!
No, leave me, just leave me!
We're all going to die
if you don't just leave me here.
Come on, no way, sir.
Oh, come on, let's go sir.
Oh, come on, get off me! Leave me!
Chief!
I am the senior rank on this team,
and I'm telling you to leave me,
Leave me! Get off me!
No! Come on, sir!
Go! Leave me a fucking gun!
Where's the chief, where's the chief?
What the hell did you do to him?
He told me to leave him,
he told me to leave him, get off me!
Chief! Chief!
Stop, no, get down, get down!
Chief! Chief!
Get down from there,
come on, get down from there!
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Move, move, move!
Let's go! Come on, let's go!
Come on, we're almost in!
Faster, faster!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Give me your hand soldier,
give me your hand!
That's Big Red!
So, let me get this straight.
We live in the 21st century,
and we don't let women into combat.
Now, how is it that you two
were let on this mission,
way back in 49.
Well, Betty's a nurse
and well I guess they needed somebody
to take notes and make coffee.
Bet you don't do that anymore.
We ran out of coffee years ago.
Don't be mean.
I always thought you two
would make a fine couple.
Really? I always thought Erik
was kind of a fuddy-duddy.
Oh, and I always thought
you were kind of sweet on Frank.
Well who wasn't hot for Frank?
Everybody had the hots
for Squirt, right Ruth?
Betty.
Listen to those two.
Frank, you ever get married?
No.
You ever gotten laid?
Where's Bud?
He's down there.
Excuse me.
Hey, are we at war
with the Soviet's yet?
What's a Soviet?
Hey Picasso.
Hey, Doc.
You know it was your paintings
that helped us find you.
Is that right?
What the hell is that?
Oh, just messing around.
Hey, how's my Viv?
Oh Bud, she passed about 3 years ago.
Cancer. I'm sorry.
I figured Doc, I saw how old you got...
She never re-married,
she never gave up on you.
And my boy?
David, he's okay.
Out with it, Frank.
I don't know, he's angry.
He thinks with his fists,
he damn near killed a man in a bar fight.
Goddamn kid! Damn it!
Well I reckon he's
bigger than I am now...
...older and bigger.
Isn't my Viv a beauty, Doc?
Time, huh, it's a fucked
up thing, ain't it?
it’s breathtaking.
It's one of the things
I'm going to miss the most.
You couldn't have known, Frank.
The tracer was damaged on impact.
It wasn't your fault.
There's nothing you
could have done about it.
I should have seen it coming.
I should have known.
Frank, look at this.
This amazing adventure.
I'm seeing things that no man
has ever seen, or ever will see.
I'm going to go back to a world
that's just as new and
exciting as this one.
It wasn't supposed to end like this.
Who's life ever turns out
the way it's supposed to?
Alright, we've got to get moving,
so pack light, but grab
some things we need.
Here, grab these, why
don't you try that?
Alright, when we get going,
we're going straight and fast,
make sure your weapons are ready.
Ruth, get plenty of water bottles...
Got it. Also, remember
to walk side by side,
it's very important...
They're not going to take
out the weakest prey,
they're going to take out the lead
so the rest scatter,
so let's stay together...
Yeah, let's stay together,
let's try and have a
day where nobody dies.
I mean, that would be great,
I'd really enjoy not having to bury
one of my friends, that would be great.
Frank, let's go home.
Hey chief, can we take a break?
We need some rest.
Yeah.
Yeah, I need a breather.
You need to get some water, Squirt.
What are they recruiting
in the Navy now?
Girl Scouts?
Frank. Where did you say
that entry point was?
About a mile and a half, due East.
It's getting late, we better get going.
Frank, we best be moving.
Hey, come on man, we need to get going.
Pull my hand.
Pull your hand? Why
don't you pull my dick!
Get down!
Oh, Geez!
it’s coming back!
it’s still working, alright,
everyone move back,
I don't know how big it will be.
How are you going to initiate
the Kassimer effect?
Sub-atomic particles with negative mass.
No, no, no, no! You
created exotic matter?
Let's move it people!
No, no, no, wait!
How are you going to close the margins
without the Rainbow Device?
Quickly, into the Singularity.
Manriquez, let's go.
No. Frank...
Unless the connection is closed,
the weak energy condition
will continue to expand the wormhole,
until it absorbs everything.
What is he saying?
He's saying that someone has to
stay behind to close the portal.
What?
I'll do it.
No!
You don't know how to
operate the device.
I knew what I was
doing when I came here,
I'm an old man, I've lived my life.
I took away sixty years from you,
and now I'm giving it back.
Go. Go.
Thank you.
Take care of your boy.
No, Frank. I'm going to
come back for you, I promise.
If it takes another 60 years,
I'm going to come back for you.
You alright? Time travel's
a bitch, ain't it?
Wooo! We're back...
Yes! Yes! Civilization Baby!
At ease, at ease!
Yes sir!
So it didn't work...
Oh, it worked.
But you just left...
...and we just got back.
Okay, so where's Lieutenant Peet,
where's the doc, where's everybody else?
Well, they didn't get
through now, did they?
I think something's coming through.
Manriquez, Manriquez!
What the hell is that thing,
and how did it get here?
Genus Therapoda,
from the Carcharodontosaur
family, I think.
Who are you?
Science Officer Lieutenant
Erik Reno, sir.
This is Chief Petty Officer Stark,
Yeoman Calendar, and...
Yeah, alright, alright, alright.
Main thing, we have to keep
that thing in the building.
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.
Oh shit!
Oh shit, damn it.
Come on, come on.
Coronado, this is Commander Dorn.
C Code, 47423. We have a situation.
Jesus Christ.
Holy Moses!
Looks like you're driving.
Yeah.
Coronado, contact Command Centre.
I need a Seahawk, North Tower.
Alright, come on people, talk to me.
What's this thing going to do?
He's getting confused,
he's going to find some place to hide.
Look out!
Jesus Christ, Go! Go!
Goddamn, that thing is fast!
Yeah, you're not kidding. Where is he?
I don't know,
we just have to get to that helipad,
we have to get airborne.
There's our ride people, let's go.
Alright, everybody in? Let's go.
I don't like this.
Damn it. Where is it?
I don't see anything!
LAPD at 9 o clock sir!
Alpha Command this is LAPD Air One.
Air One, this is Alpha Command!
Please identify threat.
The threat is biological in nature,
it is bi-pedal and it is carnivorous.
Say it again Alpha,
what is it that we're looking for?
it’s a dinosaur, we're
looking for a dinosaur.
Who the fuck is this...
and how did you get in
on the secure line?
This is commander Dorn, US Navy,
and I shit you not,
we are looking for a bi-pedal dinosaur
approximately 60 feet
long and 20 feet tall.
This is bullshit,
switch over to thermal imaging, now.
Roger.
Nothing Alpha, or whoever you are,
thermal imaging shows nothing.
There's nothing like you
just described, nothing.
Where the hell is that thing?
Sir, did he say thermal imaging?
You're not going to be able
to see him with heat sensors.
Why not?
Dinosaurs are ectothermal.
Air-One, Alpha One,
target is cold-blooded,
you're going to have to
eyeball it yourself,
there is a dinosaur on the loose.
Let me guess, it can fly too.
I'm going in!
Hold your fire!
There's civilians down there!
What? ! Civilians? You mean snacks!
Okay, so this thing is cold-blooded,
it can eat helicopters,
anything else we need to know?
I'm telling you commander,
this thing's got thick skin.
M60 rounds don't even pierce it.
People assume that because dinosaurs
have small brains they're unintelligent.
That isn't true.
No. Red's smart!
When we first ran into him,
he chased us into a series of caves.
8 days later
Commander Diz, our CO, came out,
he ate him.
After that, we learned never to enter
or exit through the same place.
Union Station, sir!
Well, it's nice to see
something's still the same.
Alright, let's put her down.
Betty, Ruth, you stay here.
Hey, hey!
I don't think so!
Stay in the air, we'll take the ground.
Fuck!
You just don't listen.
I just don't want to.
Any sign of him yet?
I think that might be him.
Swing back around, we'll
check south of Pico.
Take her up, take her up! !
Holy shit, sir! I'll swing back around!
He went down Brooklyn Ave. ,
or I think it's Brooklyn Ave.
Alright, we're going to have to
split up and find him.
Then what?
We have to find him first.
How the hell can they run so fast?
They've been living in 11% oxygen
for the last 6 years.
They're processing O2
like ultra-marathoners.
Alright, you son of a bitch! Lieutenant!
Bud! Bud! Honey, where are you!
Bud!
Don't you talk about my mother!
Get out of here, get out of here, now!
No!
Oh God, thank God!
Any ideas?
Running always seemed to work.
Well, you used to live here, right?
What do you think we should do?
Third street tunnel,
we could trap him inside of
the third street tunnel,
I mean, if it's still there,
we could trap him inside of it.
Well, great, great,
so how do we get him in the tunnel?
Yep, more running.
I thought so.
Alright.
Sir, the CHP has blocked
all traffic into downtown.
Any sign of our friends?
There, there they are!
Move down, move down
to there, right there!
Ready?
Ready.
Hey! Hey Big Red!
You've been wanting this
for the last six years, come and get it!
Over here!
You stupid piece of shit!
Oh, shit!
What the hell are they doing?
They're trying to lead
him into the tunnel.
Tell LAPD to block the tunnel entrances.
Alpha One, this is Stingray One,
we understand you have a problem.
There he is!
Target is heading west on 3rd street.
Stingray One, copy?
Copy Alpha One,
but we can't take it out...
without doing serious
damage to real estate.
Serious damage to real estate?
it’s already doing serious
damage to real estate.
I am not launching a missile attack
against a major US city.
Stingray One, hold your position,
wait for my orders.
Roger that.
Alright, LAPD is ready
to block both ends of the tunnel.
They have incendiary
bombs and flame throwers.
Okay, we're going to burn
that son of a bitch.
Is he still following us?
No.
Where the hell is he going?
it didn't work.
Big Red kept right on going.
We'll catch him on the
other side of the tunnel.
Shit, come on!
He's coming over Bunker Hill,
he's coming over Bunker Hill!
Oh!
Shit, what the hell is happening?
Where'd that tank come from?
I don't know sir,
but it doesn't look like
it came from Van Nuys!
Go!
Frank? !
Oh my god, Erik?
Oh, I missed you, I'm glad you're okay.
How did you get back here?
About a year or so after
you guys disappeared,
I came back 60 years older
went through the time portal
to try to beat you guys back.
He went through the time portal
and tried to reset the timeline.
He went through as it was closing up.
You crazy old man.
As far as I know, his
trip was cut short,
got sent back to 1950, mortally wounded.
What?
Before he died, he told me everything.
He showed me how to
use the Rainbow Device.
I could have never done what he did.
But you did, you did!
God, we missed you, Squirt!
Oh, don't call me Squirt!
He told you.
He didn't have to.
Alright, I'm loving the reunion and all,
but what about the dinosaur?
Well that's why I'm here.
So, what are we supposed to do?
We wait.
Take position over the
top of that bridge.
Be ready for when the beast gets back.
No! No! Not this time.
Jesus Christ!
Just be ready! Be ready!
Kowalski, get a look,
look down over that rail,
see if you can see him anywhere.
There's no way LAPD is going to
block every downtown LA access
before rush hour starts.
We've got to end this now.
This is Stingray One.
You can't do that, sir,
it's our people down there!
I've got no choice.
Lock on to these coordinates
and arm your Mavericks.
What about collateral damage, sir?
Light them up Stingray.
This one's on me!
Copy that, sir.
Stingray, this is, on my mark!
I'm locked on target and ready to fire.
Sir, he's leading Big
Red back to the tunnel.
Stingray, stay, hold your fire!
I repeat, hold your fire!
Please tell me that was one of ours.
It's over, it's gone, it's over.
Looks like you're stuck with us, Doc.
Well, not quite,
I never make the same mistake twice.
1950, anyone?
Go home? See my Vivian again?
She's alive?
I think I'd like to grow old with you.
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Someone's supposed to stay behind
and close that portal, right?
No, it's my turn.
You're crazy.
He won't be alone.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
Take care of that son of yours. Alright?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I'm going to miss you, Squirt.
I may have picked the wrong man.
Oh yeah? Look at this...
Oh, I'm going to miss you, girl.
Take care, little bro, take care.
I'll see you in 65 years.
Take care, bro.
You know I will.
Hey, hey, hey. One more thing,
where did you send Big Red?
Back where he belongs.
