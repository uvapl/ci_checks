Justin, I found your bag.
Do you mind if
I tear through it
And look at all
your personal stuff?
Okay, thanks!
No way!
(screams)
Justin!
(grunts)
(yells)
(grunts)
What is going on?
Is everyone all right?
Alex?
(muffled screams)
Awesome!
Dad, whatever it is,
can I keep it?
I knew it!
Alex was going
through my bag,
So I put a spell on it.
Deny it now.
Of course.
An enchanted messenger bag.
How did we ever
manage without one?
But we're going to
have a great... Do it.
Let's watch her run around.
Magic was used to
protect the bag.
Reverse the spell,
release the hag.
Okay, fine.
I went through
your stupid bag.
Hag?
But look at what I found.
The family wand
and the book of
<i>forbidden spells.</i>
Justin took it
out of the lair
without permission.
My respect for you
is increasing.
I didn't take it.
Dad gave it to me.
And it's shrinking again.
Dad, how could you
give this to Justin?
It's forbidden.
You said that
we weren't allowed
to touch it.
You said that
we weren't ready.
I think by "we"
he meant "you."
Alex, if one day, possibly,
you pass and/or show up
to an exam,
You can use the spell book
and the family wand, too.
It's just they're
extremely powerful
And it takes a certain level
of responsibility...
But I'm responsible enough.
I can be trusted.
I think this is
completely unfair to me
and Max. Right, Max?
Dude. Max!
(grunts)
Dude, you are so not
helping right now.
And I am so getting
one of those!
Well, I don't really
have an opinion
About the great
wand whoop-de-doo.
But if anybody should be
playing nice right now,
it's you.
Don't push.
We need to go, honey.
Yes, dear.
I'm gonna need you
to return the wand
and spell book
Back to where you found them.
Thank you.
Fine. I didn't even
want it anyway.
Total lie. Wait.
Where's everybody going?
I want you guys done packing
by the time we get back.
Justin: Okay.
Dude, this is gonna be
the best vacation ever.
Are there gonna be volcanoes?
No.
Then how great can it be?
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Russo.
Hey, Harper. That's...
Hey, what's Harper
doing here?
Oh, uh... Right.
Listen, I was thinking
Since you're packing
for a trip
I don't have to go on...
What did I just say to you?
When? All the way back there?
Don't push.
I already told you,
you can't go to that party.
It's all the way
in Brooklyn. I don't know
the girl's parents.
But, mom, everybody is
going to this party.
That's true.
They've handed out
like 1,000 fliers.
Why are you
destroying my life?
Which is the same thing
you said to me
When I tried to force you
to go on vacation with us.
Well, it worked then.
Alex, honey, I know that
you're growing up
And you want
some independence,
And I know that you're
gonna be fine at Harpers
while we're gone.
But you have to
understand that
Leaving you behind
is very hard for me.
So just go easy on me, okay?
Dad, please.
I'll just pop in.
It'll be so quick...
No popping. You heard
what your mother said.
(sighs)
And just so we're clear,
no walking, flying,
teleporting
Or popping out
of this building
While we're gone.
Is that understood?
Understood.
Okay.
(exhales)
Sorry about that.
It's okay.
We can still find
something super fun yet
age-appropriate to do.
No, we're still going.
But your parents said
we can't leave the building.
Exactly.
(train whistle blowing)
For the record,
I just want to say
I think this is a really,
really bad idea.
Only if by bad
you mean genius.
I love loopholes.
Alex!
(nervous chuckle)
Can't we slow
this thing down?
Yeah... No.
When they put the tables in
they must have taken
the controls out,
But don't worry,
it's enchanted and knows
where it's going.
Then why are we
heading uptown?
Forty-second. Forty-ninth.
Fifty-seventh.
Brooklyn's in
the other direction
On the other side
of the River.
Stupid spells. Hang on.
Wait. My bad.
I had the map upside down.
All right.
Misguided directions
we shouldn't have taken.
Hurry up and get us
to Bergen Street station.
These forbidden spells
are so super user-friendly.
Forbidden spells?
Why would you use something
called a forbidden spell?
It's forbidden,
and I know this
Because it's right
there in the title.
It's not really
a big deal when you
have the right wand.
Well, do you?
No.
Apparently, it's too
powerful and I'm not
responsible enough
And I can't be trusted.
Whatever that means.
(screaming)
No, you go first!
You go first!
Oh, my God.
No! What are you...
Harper...
(both screaming)
Seriously!
Who designed this subway?
(screaming)
I did it.
I can't believe I did it.
I saved us.
I can't believe it.
No, you didn't. I did.
Justin, thank you,
thank you, thank you!
Harper, don't thank him.
He just did it
so he can run off
and tell on me.
Okay, normally, yeah,
I would do that.
It's pretty funny
when she gets all...
But I'm not about
to go tell mom and dad
something
That's gonna ruin
their vacation one night
before it happens.
For once, I'm not
gonna let you destroy
something important to me.
Then we're good
because they're not gonna
hear it from me.
And you know why
they're not gonna
hear it from me?
Didn't we just have
this conversation?
Because I just did
my first spell
Using a full-powered
wizard wand.
And if I must say...
He must.
It worked perfectly.
Almost perfectly.
(both gasp)
(glass shatters)
Okay. Well... Bye.
(Alex sighs)
I'm really sorry
you can't stay
with me anymore.
No. I was never really gonna
get to stay with you.
She's just been
planning this all along.
And she's just using
my innocent borrowing
of the diner as an excuse.
You know that's not true.
You love your mom.
I didn't say that I didn't.
I just...
I just don't want
to spend two weeks in
full-on family mode.
(chuckling) are you guys
gonna wear matching outfits?
Because that would be bad.
One of these days
I'm gonna win
the wizard competition
And I'm gonna be
the full wizard.
Well, what if you
fall in love with a mortal
And have to
give up your powers
like your dad did?
I still can't believe
he did that.
I can. I love that story.
It sounds so romantic.
It was.
Do you need any help?
No.
I most definitely
do not need your help.
Well, bye.
Fine. But one of these days
I just might not be
there to offer it.
Mom.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.
I know what you meant.
Finish packing.
Done.
(scoffs)
Undone.
See what I just did there?
It's called
lightening the mood.
Well, I hope
you got it out
of your system,
Because I've declared
this vacation magic-free.
Hand it over.
Jerry: So I'm gonna
need your wands.
What?
I can't give up my wand.
Dad, there are
so many spells
I haven't even
Gotten a Chance to do yet.
Max.
(bleating)
Goats?
They were supposed
to be tigers.
Okay, if I give you
my wand, I'll only be able
to do hand magic.
The idea is no magic.
I can't just not do
magic for two weeks.
We're going to the Caribbean.
That's one of
the most magical places
in the entire universe.
This is because
of Alex, isn't it?
Justin.
It's not always because of...
Well, okay, yes.
Just give me the wand.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me the wand.
Give me the wand.
All right.
"sticky note to self,
do not forget sticky notes."
Okay, it's time, people!
Everybody ready?
Ready!
Okay.
Who needs underwear?
Ready!
Ready!
Ready?
Smile!
Tell me this is not
the cutest thing
you've ever seen.
(laughs) yeah. Sorry.
A real family vacation.
This is gonna be so much fun!
You guys are gonna
love this resort.
It has everything.
Yes, it's beautiful.
You know it's where
your father and I
first met each other.
She's going to tell it.
Please don't tell it.
Did I ever
tell you the story?
And she's telling it.
It was the Summer
after I graduated
from college.
I was lying
by the pool, right?
And I had just ordered
this papaya smoothie.
All: It was a guava smoothie.
It was a guava smoothie.
Actually, honey,
it was a guava smoothie.
No, no, no, no.
Why would I order
a guava smoothie?
I don't even like guavas.
(laughs) so, somehow
I spilled papaya
All over your father's shirt.
All: Guava.
Guava.
But then I looked up
into his eyes and I knew.
(speaks Spanish)
This is the man for me.
It was love at first sight.
(Alex groans)
No visuals, please.
(moaning)
Or audio.
We're here!
(sighs)
I have never been
more happy to
Be somewhere I didn't want
to be in my entire life.
<i>Hola</i> and welcome to paradise.
And the happiness continues.
Max: Sweet!
Jerry: Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Put that back.
Are those included
in the price?
Yes. Of course.
Welcome to the Caribbean.
Everybody take two.
(Theresa thanks in Spanish)
Enjoy.
I'll just take
the whole tray.
Well, I'm Javier.
I'm one of the activities
counselors here.
Well, that's great
because I already know
The first thing
I'd like you to do.
Would you take our picture?
Yeah. Of course.
Smile.
Say, "paradise."
Paradise.
Not likely.
(exclaims)
Jerry, look, it's that
little gift shop
Where we bought those
coconut monkeys!
Remember?
Let's take a picture of it.
I love those monkeys.
(Max slurping)
Great outfits.
What is going on?
Where's everybody going?
I'm going snorkeling.
Once you get used to swimming
in a fish's toilet bowl,
it's awesome.
To see the ruins.
The most important battles
of the first and third troll
wars were fought there.
I don't know,
but I'm getting out of here.
No. No. No.
This is a family vacation.
Your mother's right.
We should be doing
everything together.
With you? In public?
Looking like that?
So we're all in agreement.

(thanks in Spanish)
Oh. Alex, honey,
don't you just love
the ancient walls
And the cobblestone streets?
You know what?
Your dad and I walked
these very streets
On one of our
very first dates.
It must have been pretty
when it was new.
Hey. This attitude of yours?
That's what's getting old.
I'm sorry, but it's just
memory Lane is turning out
To be the longest road ever.
When are we gonna do
something I want to do?
You're right. You're right.
We haven't got to do
something you want to do.
You get to choose next,
all right?
Did I mention
Javier teaches windsurfing?
Theresa, look.
Ooh! My favorite earrings.
Dude, check it out.
Top 100 must-see
wizard sightings
on the island.
I wonder why we
haven't been to any yet.
Wait. I know.
Archie:
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention
For just one moment?
Prepare to...
Fine. You want magic?
There's your magic.
And now the beautiful Giselle
will find your card, sir.
Your card. Here we go.
Are you ready? Yes, you will.
Remember what it is?
Okay, there you go.
Just not that one.
Which one do you think it is?
Not that one. No, wrong one.
Go ahead. Try again.
It's the eight of clubs.
The one I'm shoving in
your mouth.
Like we rehearsed.
Like we rehearsed.
There it is! The eight...
She dropped it. Hang on.
Eight of clubs! Amazing!
What do you say?
Pretty amazing is what I say.
Pretty pathetic
is what I say.
Anybody? Anybody?
You know what the problem
is with you two?
You don't know how
to make your own fun.
Archie:
It's a magical balloon trick.
(blows)
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to volunteer.
Okay. I wasn't
really aware that I was
asking for volunteers.
(laughs)
Right. Got any money?
Yes.
Hope that didn't break you.
Right. First of all,
I will need your drink.
Why?
Because I'm doing
eight shows a day
in the blazing sun.
Here, try and blow this up.
Strong lungs?
(squawks)
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,
The incredible needle
through balloon.
The needle through...
Oh, yeah. By the way,
If you happen to see
<i>la policia</i> anywhere,
Don't keep it
to yourselves, okay?
Because we're having issues.
Thanks.
Needle through the balloon.
Okay, that's weird.
Watch out.
(crowd laughing)
(yells)
No. No.
(Archie yells)
Max.
Come on.
No!
Oh, yeah.
Now that's a great trick.
(yells)
Whoa!
(crowd laughing)
Thank you.
That was good, right?
I totally meant
for that to happen.
Nicely done.
Archie: Thank you!
That's got to be
worth something.
Thank you. Thank you.
Anything else?
Archie: Brilliant.
You're awesome. Very good.
Hey! Hey! Kiddo!
Hey, hold on!
I want to talk to you.
Just hold on.
Hold on a second! Hold...
Jeez, he's coming.
Yeah, all right.
I'm going.
Hello, Bert.
How's the missus?
Excuse me. Nice truncheon.
Hey! Come back!
Jerry:
What were you thinking?
Is it my fault that
the guy's a great magician?
All right. Look,
I'm sorry, but it was
just training magic.
It's no big deal.
I promise you nobody's
gonna figure out
that we're wizards.
Archie: You're wizards?
Maybe just one person.
What? No.
(chuckle nervously)
That's funny.
But we are most
definitely not...
Don't even try it.
You think if I could
actually do that trick,
I'd be hustling tourists
for loose change?
Hidden talents.
Come on, kids, let's go.
What? No, no, wait, wait!
I forgot the most
important part.
We're wizards, too.
You're wizards?
I don't think so.
Well, not now.
I mean, obviously.
Yeah, but we were. I swear.
Wizard's honor.
(squawks)
I was born a wizard,
but I lost out
At the family
wizard competition
To my know-it-all
older brother.
I know the feeling.
I know the feeling.
And the poor lovely
Giselle here
Was transformed into her
current feathery state
by an evil... Ow!
Not telling that part
of the story.
Well, it was nice
running into you,
And good luck with
the whole magic thing.
Your "pick a card,"
it's great.
Everybody into the van.
Let's go.
Wait.
I could... I could show you
some of the wizarding sights.
I am also an excellent,
reasonably-priced tour guide.
Tips are greatly encouraged.
That actually sounds
pretty cool. I was just...
No. It's Alex's turn
to choose,
And I just know
she's gonna pick
Something really
far away from here.
Come on.
When did we decide
it was Alex's...
What if my choice is to watch
Justin's lip quiver and beg?
(laughs)
Theresa:
Come on, honey. Sorry.
Max: Shotgun.
I could show you
<i>la piedra de los suenos.</i>
The Stone of dreams?
I know where it is.
We have a map.
That's like the most important
wizard artifact ever.
It can do anything.
Yeah.
You know where it is?
Yes.
Dad. He's got a map
to the Stone of dreams.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So does every other
wizard gift shop in town.
And every year,
two or three idiot wizards
Go la-di-daing
through the Forest
trying to find the Stone,
And they usually end up dead.
Please.
Okay, we're desperate.
We've been on
this island for years
Just hoping to find a wizard
who could help us.
The Stone is our only hope
Of restoring Giselle
back to her former
beautiful self.
Not that you're not
beautiful right now.
You're beautiful.
You're gorgeous,
In this light.
I'm sorry.
It's just too dangerous.
Come on, Justin.
Let's go.
You're in the middle seat.
Yeah, I know.
But what other choice
did I have?
I mean, if they...
Right. But I know...
I have a...
If you'd just listen...
I know what I'm doing.
(chatters)
Yes, there's a first time
for everything. Very funny.
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Though you might need
a few more lessons.
(laughs) not at these prices.
Javier: I wasn't good
my first time either, so...
I'm just having
a little problem
With the wind part
and the surfing part
And the standing-up part.
Justin: Hey, Alex!
Watch and learn!
Just like always.
Way to go, Justin! Great job!
Forbidden-smidden.
Though a surfboard
I might be a mess on,
My brother is in need
of a lesson.
Justin: Whoa!
How do you slow down
on this thing?
Go back! Go back!
(screams)
Big wave! How do I stop?
(screams)
He's got the wand.
Wow! Nice one, Justin!
That's awesome!
He's a natural!
Yeah, a natural idiot.
Justin: Too fast! Too fast!
Turn to the wind
to slow down.
Which way is the wind?
I can't see!
Watch it.
Okay, watch it. Watch out!
Watch it! Watch out!
(grunts)
Ooh.
Every castle
needs a Princess, huh?
No? Okay.
(Jerry laughing)
I shouldn't have laughed,
but you know she
was okay, right?
Yeah, but poor Alex.
Glad you guys are having
such a good time.
Javier: Alex.
Listen, there's a party down
at the beach later.
Any Chance I could talk you
into going with me?
A huge Chance.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, my mother
isn't so easily persuaded.
But I'll work something out.
Cool. I'll see you then.
What are you working out?
Um...
How sweet I have to be
for you to let me go to
this party tonight.
With him?
It's so not happening.
Why can't I go?
Alex. First of all,
we, all of us, together,
we're on vacation, honey.
More like
a never-ending photo shoot.
I am trying to
create memories.
And second, I said no.
You don't need to be spending
any more time with that boy.
But you don't even know him.
I know that he's
too old for you,
That he probably
hits on every girl that
comes to this resort,
And, at best, he's just
trying to hustle you
Into taking more
windsurfing lessons.
A party I must attend,
on that we can't agree.
But for a refreshing change,
today you'll side with me.
You know what?
You're young. Go.
Have a good time.
What am I saying?
Absolutely not. Come on,
everybody's waiting.
Dang it. Not enough juice.
We were sitting right here
when I told your mother
I was a wizard.
Yes, and he also told me
that he loved me.
Dad, why would you do
something like that?
Didn't you know you were
gonna have to give up
your magic?
Well, I knew it was
an important decision,
But I also knew
that we could make
some magic of our own.
Well, that was beautiful.
Really, guys. I'm tearing up.
Pork? You, Justin?
Good. Let's go.
I know you have the wand.
What? No, no, no.
I don't have the wand.
I don't know why
you would think
I have the wand.
I wouldn't take the wand
from mom and dad
because that would be...
You went through
my stuff again.
Didn't have to.
There's no way
you could stay on
that windsurfer.
Well, the wind was
blowing really hard.
What was I...
(exhaling)
You? No, no, no.
That's impossible.
You can't do weather spells
unless you have a wand.
Or you use...
You have the spell book.
You're not even
gonna try to deny it?
Why?
Okay, so here's the fun
blackmailing part.
Let me use the wand
or I'll tell dad
You really did take it
without permission this time.
Fine.
Then I'll tell dad
you took the book.
So? I'm not
the good one. Please.
I found this amazing
agreement spell
That'll make mom and dad
agree to anything
for six hours,
But I don't have enough power
on my own. I need the wand.
So just tell me.
I already have the power.
Fine.
You sneak out of dinner,
Do a forbidden spell
and risk eternal grounding.
Right. You do the spell.
I'll go keep
mom and dad busy.
Okay.
A party I must attend,
on that we can't agree.
But for a refreshing change...
Theresa: Alex?
Mom? What are you doing here?
The minute Justin
tried to magically
glue me to my chair,
I knew something was up.
You will just not stop,
will you?
Well, what am I
supposed to do?
Since you've decided that
You wanted to control
every single second
of my life.
Please. Do you think
I'm doing this for me?
Like you're actually
pleasant to be around?
I am 16. You can't keep
telling me what to do.
Watch me.
For the rest of this trip
you are going to be
pleasant and present...
You can't make me.
And when we get home,
you are grounded
for two months.
That's right. No dating.
No parties. No magic.
Mom!
Not another word.
I've had it.
Now put that stuff away.
(grunts)
I hate you!
I wish you and dad
had never even met!
Mom?
Theresa: Yes, yes.
Okay. Thank you.
(thanks in Spanish)
(clears throat)
Is everything okay?
Yes. You startled me.
I didn't think you'd
get here so quickly.
I was just next door.
Well, like
I just told the Guy
at the front desk,
They accidentally brought
some guy's luggage
to my room.
Get rid of it, will you?
You're a little young
to be the concierge.
Concierge?
But I bet that means
you know where all the hot
spots are, am I right?
I'll definitely be
calling you later.
And if you see the maid,
tell her I need more towels.
Justin!
Justin!
Alex! Alex, what happened?
Nothing. Why?
Does something seem wrong?
Where's dad?
I don't know.
He left and then mom left
and no one came back.
Did you do the spell?
I did a spell.
There's dad. Hold on.
Jerry: Yeah, looking good.
Hey, I think
I'm gonna skip out
on all the family stuff
And just focus on
the wizard ruins. Cool?
Sounds good, dude.
You know, like I always say,
do what you got to do.
Bring it and...
(mimics explosion)
Later.
Did dad just call me "dude"?
Dibs.
Why are mom and dad
acting like they
don't know each other?
And why is dad using magic?
Dad is not supposed to
have magic.
And why is he giving flowers
to other girls?
Alex, what did you do?
See? This is what you get
for letting me use the wand.
Are you sure this is
where you left them?
Yes. The world went all...
(vocalizing)
And then I threw the wand
and the spell book
right there on the bed.
Hey, guys.
Thanks for ditching me
back at the restaurant.
Alex, do you want
to tell our little brother
what you did?
She got in a huge fight
with mom and dad
and used the family wand...
That you gave me.
This is not my fault!
...To wish that mom
and dad had never met
and now they haven't.
It's exactly like
it was 20 years ago.
They don't know each other,
and they don't know us.
So we have no parents anymore?
Well, I'm confused.
I mean, is this a good thing
or a bad thing?
The kid's got a point.
This is a very,
very bad thing!
And once again proves
why I don't do bad things,
Because whenever I do,
more bad things happen.
So you're admitting
that this is kind of
your fault.
I can only think
of one place
where they'd be.
(laughing)
Jerry: You're cute.
You know that?
See? There's the book.
Since he hasn't met mom,
he hasn't had to give up
his powers yet.
He's still a full wizard.
Well, then, we should
just get the book
And figure out a way
to reverse the spell.
If we still
want it reversed.
Yes.
I'm just checking.
You're both making this
way too complicated.
There's mom, all right?
She'll know who I am.
Mom.
Hey.
What? What?
Don't you recognize me?
Should I?
Yeah. Yeah,
you should. It's me. Max.
Maximum. Maximilian?
"the cutest little Guy
in the whole world."
Or was that just
a bunch of words to you?
Gosh, if I had
known there'd be this
many kids around,
I never would have
booked this place.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You really don't
recognize me?
No idea. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Wait! Mom, no!
Max!
Theresa: What are you doing?
Hey, Alex.
Theresa: Let go.
Javier. Look, I'm sorry.
Something popped up.
I can't go.
Hey, no worries.
Some other time, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But let me know
if you want
some more lessons,
Because if you buy five
you get an amazing discount,
all right?
Theresa: Let go
of me right now!
Hurt, angry, plotting revenge
and oddly disappointed
I don't have a mother
to say, "I told you so."
Please!
Alex: Oh, my gosh.
Mom, no! No.
I'm so sorry.
Sorry. He has
abandonment issues.
Let go of me right now. Mom.
Mom? Security!
Just a simple
levitation spell.
Please. It's my specialty.
You have no specialty.
(exhales)
(neck cracking)
Here we go.
Nobody touches the book.
(laughs)
I totally got you.
Your eyes were like,
"what's he gonna do?"
All right.
So, what do I got here?
A couple of young wizards
trying to pull a prank?
Something like that.
Excellent. You know what?
I turned my math teacher
into a golden retriever
one time.
Never got caught.
Played fetch a lot
in the class.
You know,
rolled things up
and threw it.
One order of  <i>grande</i> nachos.
Thank you.
(thanks in Spanish)
The portions here
are really small.
You just did magic for fun.
And for cheese dip.
You guys want something?
You hungry?
It's on me.
It's just money, right?
Where was that attitude
when I wanted my own phone?
I know, right?
Parents can be such jerks.
Hey, for no
particular reason,
Just making
conversation here,
I don't suppose you have
a titanium wand on you?
I so do!
I'm my family's wizard.
I... I've got more power
than you could ever imagine.
Pretty cool, huh?
You know, people say that
magic isn't that important.
But guess what?
They're liars.
It totally is! Here.
Magic is awesome.
Check it out.
(playing Caribbean music)
(people cheering)
Excuse me.
Yeah.
The front desk just called.
They're getting that luggage
out of your room.
Guys, that's our stuff.
Since you're a full wizard,
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Suppose a young, stupid,
selfish, inexperienced...
He gets it.
...Wizard accidentally
wished that her parents
had never met before.
What do you do to fix that?
I have no idea.
(laughing) I'm glad
that wasn't on my exam.
But they'd have to do
something pretty fast,
You know,
to prevent any serious,
permanent damage.
Serious?
Permanent?
Damage?
Yeah, you know,
Let's say these people
had kids, right...
I love this song!
Shake it! Shake.
So, eventually,
reality would catch up
with the kids
And they'd disappear forever.
No meet. No kids.
This is simple magic logic.
Who is your teacher?
How soon exactly?
I don't know. Like 48 hours?
Forty-eight hours?
Forty-eight hours.
But they'd know
before it was gonna happen
Because they'd start
forgetting everything
about their past.
I can't remember
when I was 10.
I don't remember
any of your birthdays.
Did I have a 10th birthday?
They'd need a Miracle.
All right, well, it was nice
chatting with you guys.
I hear
there's a kicking party
down on the beach. Later!
A Miracle or
<i>la piedra de los suenos.</i>
The Stone of dreams?
Yeah, that'd do it.
You know, I hear
it can Grant any wish
or reverse any spell.
Oh, man, that'd be fun
trying to find that.
Isn't it dangerous, though?
So?
Is he always like this?
I almost forgot my nachos.
Justin: Alex. Alex!
(coughing)
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.
Mom and dad are gone.
What's your plan?
I get it.
You thought that you would
Just wake up
and problem solved.
Of course I would
think of something.
Kind of hoping...
All right, guys. Come on.
We're all gonna disappear.
Justin?
Of course I thought
of something.
Okay, Alex and I
are gonna go find
the Stone of dreams.
Max, stay here and make sure
That mom and dad
don't get into any trouble.
Trouble? They're old.
What kind of trouble
you think they're gonna
get into?
I don't know.
Meet other people,
fall in love, have kids...
Okay. All right,
I'll keep an eye on them.
Justin: I don't know.
Max: We'll figure it out.
I don't know. I.D.K.
This is serious stuff here.
I.D.K.
Focus.
Guys. Wait!
First off, I'm a girl.
You can't just expect me
to flop out of a hammock
and look perfect.
So, why don't you use
some magic and do
something about it?
(mocking laugh)
Very funny.
Second, I think this
is a really bad idea.
You heard dad.
He said that only
idiot wizards
Go out looking
for this thing.
In case you haven't noticed,
that's you.
Us.
Okay, point taken.
But, come on,
When haven't we been able
to figure out some way
to reverse a spell?
Underwater,
the seahorses...
Let me think. At the zoo...
...The scuba diving trip.
...That time
when you challenged
The lady with one leg
to a hopscotch competition...
Okay! Other than those times.
I'm just saying
before we go running off
in some jungle
I think we should explore
all of our options.
All right, fine.
What do you got in mind?
Oh.
You're agreeing with me.
Okay, then wait. Hang on.
You don't have a plan?
No.
My plan was just
to disagree with your plan.
(both laughing)
Trust me. This will work.
If it were this simple,
Don't you think
dad would have
mentioned it to us?
That's not dad-dad.
That's party-party-bam-bam-
nachos-for-everyone dad.
And again, you're sure
you don't wanna keep
that guy around?
Max, if he stays, we go.
All right. Let's do this.
Okay. The only way
we can ever hope that this,
In any way, shape or form,
Could ever possibly...
We got it.
...Work, is if we stay
completely focused.
Focused.
Wait a second. Hold on.
Just give me a second.
Almost there.
Almost focused. I'm...
Max!
Max!
All right. I'm focused.
Okay.
Oh!
What did you do?
What did I do?
What did you do?
This was your idea
in the first place.
I would never have...
Max!
Max!
Shrimp?
(exclaims)
What was that?
Okay,
so second time's a charm.
If we focus on
just changing dad,
He'll be dad,
we'll have the wand...
And we'll be grounded
for the rest of our lives.
Probably true.
It's cold.
Okay, on the count of three.
One, two, three.
(Jerry growling)
Man: Shark!
(all screaming)
Maybe I wasn't clear
on what kind of change
we were going for.
Sorry. That was
definitely my bad.
All right, okay.
I think I've got it
this time.
We don't need to
reverse the spell.
We just need to make them
a day younger
And then everything
will go back
To the way it should be,
more or less.
I'm betting on less.
Just do it.
Send away parents
who laugh and play,
Make them younger
by just a day.
(crying)
Mom!
Okay, new plan.
Justin and I
are gonna go find
the Stone of dreams.
Max, you stay here
and make sure
Mom and dad don't get
into any trouble.
That was my original idea.
I know.
I just liked it better
when I said it.
(crying)
Dad! Dad, get back here!
Here you go.
I can't believe it.
The map to
the Stone of dreams.
I knew you'd call,
that you wouldn't
let us down.
You know,
when I told you
about the map,
Giselle's feathers
were all in a ruffle,
weren't they?
She never thinks
I know what I'm doing.
This is a flier for
an all-you-can-eat special
at the crab shack.
Oh! Ooh! Ooh.
Don't want to lose that.
Best flan on the island.
Here we go.
Justin: Are you sure
this is the map?
Only one of its kind
in the entire world.
Hey, guys.
Look what I just bought.
A map to the Stone of dreams.
Pretty cool.
You guys totally inspired me.
Fingers crossed.
I'll let you know
what I find out.
Where's Max?
Jerry, wait up.
I swear,
they're like cockroaches.
You corner one and
the other one takes off
In the opposite direction.
Max: Jerry!
The only map
in the world, huh?
(squawks)
In my defense,
I haven't showered
in like two days.
The reason
the other maps don't work
Is 'cause no one knows
the right place to start.
All right,
people, let's move.
There's not a lot of time.
Which way?
There's all this writing,
but it doesn't even
make sense.
Because it's in Spanish.
Which you've only been taking
since first grade.
Well, I kind of peaked at,
<i>"habla Ingles?"</i>
(Giselle squawks)
I know,
but our options
were rather limited.
It says the path
will only reveal itself
To those whose
intentions are pure.
So me, obviously.
Normally, I'd object,
but even I can't
make that argument.
Okay.
Show me the way. Open up.
Reveal the path.
Show me the way. Open up.
Reveal the path.
Maybe...
Maybe I translated it wrong.
Here, hold this.
I'll get my
Spanish dictionary.
I did it! That was easy.
It must have been
a delayed reaction
from what I did.
Yes. Onward. I'm... Hold on.
Archie: Come on, Giselle.
Why do you always have to
bring that up?
I do apologize
you're getting wet
In a rain Forest
while we're trying
to save you.
So, hey. Stone of dreams.
One wish per wizard.
You guys get to
restore your family,
The beautiful Giselle
becomes herself again,
And, what do
I use it for, though?
I mean,
that's the question, isn't it?
(Giselle squawking)
No, I know nobody asked,
but if they did...
I said "if."
You know what?
Forget it. No, no, no.
It's gonna be a surprise.
I'm not gonna say...
No, I'm not pouting.
How did she get turned
into a bird anyway?
It's... It's really
quite a story.
Ow! Ow!
Finger! Blood! Pain!
I don't know, really.
Oh!
Justin!
Sorry.
I'm just trying to make sure
that we're headed
in the right...
Double waterfall! Yes!
We're headed in
the right direction.
Perfect. Headed in
the right direction.
Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't I lead
and you follow?
Um...
Maybe because you
can't read a map
or a compass or Spanish.
Well, I know enough
not to walk into
a giant spider web.
Get it off me!
Get it off! Get it off!
(laughing)
That never gets old.
You were screaming
like a little girl.
Get it off! Get it off me!
That doesn't count.
I actually am a little girl.
We'll never speak
of this again. Agreed?
Agreed.
Yeah, this might actually
take a little longer
than I thought.
But trust me, okay.
Trust me. Don't shake...
You're so negative.
I have a good feeling
about this.
As long as we stick close
and never let them
out of our sight...
Where'd they go?
Hello?
Where did all
this rain come from?
Yeah,
I know it's a rain Forest.
I told you that earlier.
Do you have to parrot
everything I say? Sorry.
All right, we should
be headed six degrees
north by northeast.
We just follow this path
all the way... Stop!
Yeah, about here. Okay.
Now we need to
change directions.
I think we're supposed to...
Justin, we're kind of
in a hurry here.
Time rippling.
Us disappearing.
You can't go
two seconds without
criticizing me, can you?
What?
You're right. I can't.
The will to mock
is just too great.
Could we please
just do this my way?
Why do we have to do
everything the way
you do magic?
You mean perfectly?
I mean annoyingly.
There's a right way
to do things
And that's the way
I like to do them.
Another 20 feet
in this direction.
You might want
to try it sometime.
Why are you getting taller?
Because you couldn't stop
being perfect long enough
To realize that you're
standing in quicksand.
Alex! Help me!
Please! Help me!
Get me out of here!
Help me, please!
Grab onto my hand.
Grab my hand.
Okay.
Help me. Not funny!
Now maybe
we can get someplace, huh?
Okay. So we're here,
and we need to get there.
You're holding
it upside down!
Grab onto something!
Well, that makes it better.
Not really.
I'm sinking!
It needs one of those
little "x" thingies,
like at the mall, you know?
Alex, grab onto something!
I'm sinking!
Wait, here we are.
"bottomless pit of death."
and we need to go towards
some squiggly things.
They're called mountains!
Alex.
Seriously.
Okay. Sure. Mountains.
There are small
animals in here!
Wait. There they are!
That was easy.
Okay. Help me out now.
Grab something.
(sighs) fine.
A branch. Part of a tree.
Help me, Alex.
Come on. Help me.
You've got it. Please.
Will you let me
be in control of the map?
No. Why would I
put you in charge?
Just give me the stick!
You know, I hear
the more you struggle
the faster you sink.
It's amazing
what I retain, huh?
All right, fine, fine.
Whatever you want.
Just give me the stick.
Promise?
Yes. No. Yes, yes, I promise.
Okay. Come on.
Pull! Okay, pull.
Thank goodness.
There you are.
Thought I'd lost you.
Did I miss anything?
Not a thing.
All right, people!
Let's move. This way.
The other way.
The other this way.
(speaks Spanish)
What does that mean? Coconut?
No.
(laughing)
One guava smoothie, please.
We don't make
guava smoothies. Sorry.
Well then,
what am I drinking?
Papaya.
Papaya. I love
the way you say that.
All these years.
Get your fruits straight, man.
What?
What? Nothing. Thank you.
You're welcome.
(thanks in Spanish)
Hey, why don't you take this
over to that girl for me?
You know, she was
kind of asking
about you earlier.
Who is that?
Is that your mom?
What? What? No! No.
Unless you think
she is and memories
are flooding back.
You know,
you're a weird little kid,
you know that?
Yeah, I get that a lot. So...
No. I'm good.
No worries. No worries.
I'm just saying you
could do a lot better.
Between you and me?
She's kind of a dog.
Come on, buddy.
What?
She's...
Have you looked at her?
Yes, I have
and she's hot. She's...
That's not funny.
(chuckles)
Okay, it's a little funny.
You stole that from me.
All right. Joke's over.
Turn her back before
somebody sees.
All right. I will,
as soon as you take this
over there.
Fine, but I don't know
why you want me to...
What is the matter with you?
I'm so sorry. I actually was
bringing that drink to you.
Why?
So you could throw it on me?
What did I ever do to you?
Wait. This is supposed
to be the other way around.
I'm seriously...
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why
I just did that.
You don't know why you did.
You just pick it up
and then you...
No.
You know what?
It's okay.
Let's just call it even.
No. I wasn't trying
to make things even. I...
No. I meant seriously.
I mean it. It's fine.
Okay.
It's okay.
All right.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
That's it?
What's the matter with you?
You like her, right?
Then why don't
you go after her?
Cute and feisty?
Those are the most dangerous.
I could really
fall for her, you know,
if she was a wizard.
What does that matter?
I told you.
I'm a full wizard.
I'm not going to
give up my powers
for some mortal.
You don't understand. You...
This is sticky now.
This is sticky.
You...
Why do I feel like
there was something
I was supposed to do?
(panting)
Eew!
You okay?
If mom was still mom,
this would've never happened.
She would've told me
to put on bug spray.
So? You wouldn't
have listened to her.
True, but at least
she'd be telling me,
"I told you so."
I miss her condescending tone
and her superior attitude.
Remind you of anybody?
Yes. Mom. Aren't you
listening to me?
But I'm sure if we
just asked them not
to say anything...
(squawking)
Yeah, yeah, but I know.
I know you were sentenced
to 50 years in feathers.
But maybe they
couldn't find us
If we moved to some
remote jungle somewhere.
Just you and me.
But if we take
the Stone first,
they'll disappear forever.
Which is why
it's the perfect plan.
It really is the perfect plan.
You're kind of good
at this, aren't you?
(chatters)
All right.
I hate it when we fight, too.
How are we going to get
across this thing?
There's no way.
It's impossible.
We're totally, completely,
hopelessly doomed.
Wait, there's instructions.
It's that positive attitude
that I most admire
about you, Justin.
It says we have to build
a path of Stone.
That's not
going to happen.
With magic.
That might happen.
I may not be a full wizard.
I might not have
a family wand.
And you were
no help whatsoever.
But you got
to admit, this...
This is pretty impressive.
All it takes is
a superior knowledge
of hand magic
And two semesters of
advanced placement geometry.
What? No, "loser"?
No eye-rolling?
"get a life."
what was that?
"thank you, Justin.
You saved us.
You're my hero."
Well, you're welcome.
Good job.
Righty-ho.
What?
What's a pebble
going to do to my...
(coughs)
And may I be the first?
Loser.
Okay. You know,
maybe we're just going
to hang back here
For a few moments
and stay out of your way.
No reason for all of us
to plummet to
our deaths, right?
(squawks)
Admit it.
It's not a bad idea.
It's just a simple
levitation spell.
Justin: Yes, yes.
You're brilliant. Focus.
Don't look down!
That's a long way down.
Why do you always
get so mad every time
I do something right?
Because it's like
you don't even try.
You don't even
think about it.
Not thinking works for me.
Exactly. And it's not fair.
I know everything there is
to know about magic,
And you just come along
and you do it.
Which is why I have
to study all the time.
Usually I'm all,
"family wizard.
How could it not be me?"
Then you come along
and do something like this.
Trust me,
you're not going to lose.
You'll be the family wizard.
Do you even want it?
Alex!
That was close.
I don't know.
I don't think I do.
Why? I know why I do.
I'd be nothing if
I wasn't a wizard.
Magic is the one thing that
I'm really, really good at.
Please.
You're good at everything.
I hope they make it.
"Justin's so perfect.
Why can't you be
more like Justin?"
Who says that?
Besides you? Everyone.
Mom and dad.
Well, they wouldn't say that
if I wasn't so perfect.
You know that's not true.
They love you regardless.
You know that goes both ways.
They're almost there.
Good job.
We both did a good job.
Yeah.
Hello! Hello!
Don't forget your loyal
and trusty guides.
Could you just
send the rocks back?
There's not enough time.
We'll come back for you
after we get the Stone.
Bye!
(chatters)
Yes, in retrospect,
Maybe not taking the lead
wasn't a very good strategy.
What?
Down there?
Yeah.
That does seem
to be the only way...
Have I ever mentioned
my fear of heights?
Not caring. Okay. Fine.
What? I'm going. I'm going.
'cause you can fly...
Jerry:  <i>Namaste,</i> baby.
There you are!
Good class.
Okay, where have you been?
Woman 1: See you, Jerry.
Call me.
Yoga lesson.
Which is just fancy stretching
if you ask me. But I mean...
Look at the...
Really?
That's great.
It sounds like you've
just got money to burn.
Hey, if you go to
the restaurant tonight,
don't order the noodles,
Because at 9:00,
(laughs)
They're going to
turn into worms.
People are going to freak.
Really? Really?
Pasta into worms.
Yeah!
The dad that I know
would never let me
Get away with
something like that.
I know. Mine either.
Hey, are you from new York?
What?
Me, too.
Woman 2: Hi, Jerry.
Yeah. I guess.
Actually, I'm not sure
where I was born.
Jerry: Hey.
Do you remember me?
You see, I...
Jerry: Nice suit.
Theresa. Where are you going?
None of your business.
Look, I know
what this is about.
You do?
Yes. You're trying
to set me up
with your friend.
But trust me,
he couldn't be
less interested.
What? No.
That's not true at all.
In fact,
he told me that
you were his type.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, it doesn't matter,
because I've already
made plans.
With who?
(clears throat)
All set.
The boat is ready for us.
Theresa: Thank you.
Oh. Um...
That boat?
Yeah...
Would you excuse me
for just one moment?
Please?
Justin: You warm enough?
Justin, what if we don't
get the Stone in time
And we can't save everyone?
Don't worry about it.
We will.
How do you know that?
Because it's you and I.
How can we not?
You know,
I think this is the longest
you've ever gone... Wait.
This is the longest
you've ever gone
without making fun of me.
(chuckles)
It's true.
I knew there was something
I was supposed to do.
Where do you
want me to start?
No, no, no.
I can start...
I actually
kind of like this.
Let's try this.
"only those
whose intentions are pure."
How come you could
open up the gate today
and I couldn't?
I don't know.
All I kept thinking about
was saving our family.
I was thinking
about that, too.
And how great it would be
if I was the one to do it.
There's my answer.
You're a great wizard, Justin.
I just know
a bunch of spells.
How does that make me great?
That isn't why
I think you're great.
You're always there for me,
No matter
how many times I screw up.
That doesn't make me great.
That just makes me
a good brother.
I know I don't
say it very often,
But thank you.
You're welcome.
(twigs snapping)
(whispering) Alex.
Alex, get up.
I think something's
out there.
You're the boy.
You go check it.
(twig snaps)
Oh, my gosh.
Sorry.
We didn't know who it was,
And Justin was just like,
"there's something out there."
Plus, I'm really
not good in the morning.
Justin: But, hey,
you made it. You know,
that's great.
I thought we were
going to have
to do this alone...
Look! There they are.
That's the white cliffs.
That's where the Stone is.
It's so far away.
And there it is again.
We're so close.
Come on.
(Giselle squawks)
(greets in Spanish)
I'm going to be at
the pool later. FYI.
Max: Hey!
Jerry. Jerry. Wait.
Please. Look.
You've got to
help me out here.
What? What now?
I can't remember anything
before the first grade,
And my brother and sister
never came back last night.
I don't know why
you're telling me
this stuff.
Maybe you should go
tell your parents, kid.
Well, I'm trying to do that,
but it's a little hard.
They went to try to find
the Stone of dreams.
What? But that's
incredibly dangerous.
Yeah, well,
it was kind of your idea.
I didn't think
they'd actually
try and do it.
Look, you're the only person
I know that can help me
find them.
Please.
All right.
Come on, I've got a map.
The problem is
it doesn't tell you
where to start.
Yeah.
I mean, we could...
Oh, my gosh.
Is that a treasure map?
(laughing) a treasure map?
No. Don't be ridiculous.
It is! It is a treasure map.
Well, I mean,
not one that works.
Max: Well, it is.
It's just that
we're missing a part.
My brother Justin
and my sister...
What's her name,
they had something
That's supposed
to go in this corner.
It was a picture
of a fort with this...
I don't know how
to describe it.
This gargoyle thingy on it.
Well, that could be anywhere.
I know where that is.
I saw that on my
artifact tour yesterday.
It's right...
Wait. Do I get to come with?
(whispers) yes.
No.
Why?
Are you afraid
you'll have to spend
a little time with me?
No. I wouldn't...
It's just there's a...
We need to... Tell her.
That would be wonderful.
What?
This is going to
be so much fun.
Yeah.
I'll drive,
if that's okay with you.
What?
You've got to learn
to let me do the talking.
Theresa: Let's go, boys!
The map kind of ends here.
It says we have
to find a cave.
A cave? Somewhere in
a mile of cliffs?
Well, that really
narrows it down,
doesn't it?
(reading in Spanish)
"the one who knows the least
shall lead the way."
Alex.
Sorry. It was a reflex.
No, it's okay.
I was about to say me, too.
All right, let's look.
Okay, I think that
this indentation here
Corresponds with that
indentation on the cliffs
over there.
Archie: Yes, but that
indentation could also
Correspond to
that indentation
On the cliffs
over there, mate.
Justin: Oh, that makes sense.
Why don't we
just ask someone?
Okay. I think this
patch of greenery...
Right.
...Could be that
patch of greenery
over there.
Yeah, but there's
a bush there.
There's a bush.
No one ever listens to me.
There's lots of patches
of green here.
Have you noticed
that the whole place
Is one big giant
patch of greenery?
Excuse me. Hi. Sorry. Okay.
Hi! I'm Alex!
I'm so sorry to bother you,
But I really need your help.
English? No? Of course not.
(in Spanish)
Thank you.
They're new, actually.
I just...
No! Cave. I'm sorry.
I'm looking for a cave.
Cave. You know, like...
(greets in Spanish)
(in Spanish)
I'm sorry.
Could you slow down
just a little bit?
Maybe some hand gestures
would be good, too.
Wait.
In Spanish class
I took a nap then,
how about a floating caption?
(in Spanish)
Yes. Exactly.
That's it. Where is it?
(in Spanish)
(in Spanish)
"I wonder if she knows
how bad her breath..."
Okay. We're good. Never mind.
Sorry to bother you.
Could've just stuck with,
"don't know
where the cave is."
So rude.
(speaks Spanish)
"the one who
knows the least..."
And since it's not me,
it's you.
Do you know
where the cave is?
I don't suppose you
have a breath mint
on you, do you? No? Okay.
(Theresa reading in Spanish)
It says that the path
will only reveal itself
To the one whose
intentions are pure.
What the heck does that mean?
It means it's probably time
for you to go.
And thank you so
much for your help,
but we've got it from here.
No way! I'm not
going now and let you two
have all the fun.
Besides, neither of you two
reads Spanish, right?
Right.
So I guess we're going
to have to figure
this out together.
The time for that
is way over, people...
Whoever you are.
Look, tick-tock.
We've got to get moving.
But we can't... You know.
Hey, lady. Look over there.
Theresa: What?
Do you see something?
I don't see anything.
Yeah. Yeah. There's the...
Like a ship thingy.
Theresa:
No, I think that's a bird.
Yes!
Look! Right...
There's a path.
I didn't even see that.
Come on. Come on.
Wait. Where did
that come from?
(Justin panting)
Alex: I don't suppose
you have a flashlight on you,
do you?
Oh. Allow me.
That's pretty much
all I've got.
My magic's not working.
The cave must be enchanted.
Mine's not working, either.
But I like that
"enchanted" excuse.
I'm going to have
to use that.
Me, too.
Enchanted.
You two can wait here
if you want.
What, let you two go alone?
No, no, no.
I've learned
from my mistakes.
We're in this together.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Here's an idea.
We stay here.
Okay. You ready?
No. But let's go.
Good luck.
See you soon.
Watch out for the bats
and the spiders
And the scorpions
and the snakes.
Alex: We got it!
See you.
Wouldn't want to be you.
Theresa: Hang on.
On three. One...
I can't feel my legs!
One, two, three.
(grunting)
I'm still in here, guys!
I'm not having any fun!
Why am I not laying out
by the pool?
Twice is a charm.
Let's go.
Grab it!
Grab it!
Dad, come on!
One, two, three.
Why do you have
to count to three?
Just pull!
It's slippery!
Max: How many times?
Do we even know that
this is the right cave?
I'm going to go with "yes,"
but that's just a hunch.
Wait.
(yells)
Alex: This  <i>piedra</i> thing
better reverse the spell
Or else I just got bat poop
in my hair for nothing.
It's the Stone of dreams.
It can do anything.
Reverse any spell.
Show you the future.
But you only get
one Chance at it.
I'm sorry for everything.
What?
I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.
I heard you the first time.
I just wanted to hear you
say it again.
Wow. It's amazing.
Even in the face of
the most imminent doom
You can still be
super annoying.
It's one of the few things
I learned from you.
Still doing it.
I'm sorry, too.
What are you sorry for?
You're my little sister.
I shouldn't be
on you as much.
We need each other.
Wait. What was that?
I know. Not saying it again.
Theresa: A path of Stone?
I don't know,
maybe there's a path
along the edge.
Or a giant bridge
right here in the middle!
But... How...
I don't know.
It just... Wow!
Bridge just came and it's...
You know, there's a...
Okay, not our
biggest problem right now.
Is it weird that
I can't remember
what I got for Christmas?
Look, if you don't
want to go on, it's okay.
Are you kidding me?
What kind of woman
doesn't want a little magic
in her life?
Let's go.
You know,
for a mortal woman,
she is...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.
She's a keeper. Come on.
Jerry: I like
the way she walks.
This is definitely the place.
But how are we going to find
the Stone?
It could be any one of these.
I'm guessing it's that one.
Good guess.
Careful!
Well, someone should
put up a railing
or something.
Seriously, it's dangerous.
Okay.
I'll go.
I agree. You go.
Okay.
(rumbling)
Whoa!
(exhales)
Try this one.
Okay.
Almost there.
(whines)
Don't look down.
Don't look down.
Look up. Look up. Look up.
Don't look down.
Don't look down.
Don't...
Careful. Hold on!
Hold on to the torch thing.
But not the hot part.
Why would I grab
the hot part?
Watch your foot.
Watch your foot.
Okay.
(gasps)
I got it. Thank you, column.
Don't step on
the crumbly parts!
They're all crumbly parts!
Watch it, watch it.
Justin!
Justin!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Where's the Stone?
I see it.
I think I can reach it.
No! It's too dangerous.
I have to try.
We don't really
have a choice here.
(grunts)
I got it!
I got it.
(screams)
Justin! Justin!
I got you.
I won't let you fall.
(grunts)
We did it. It's not too late.
We can fix everything.
(squawks)
No! What are you doing?
Come back!
(Giselle squawks)
Max: What?
Did you guys get it?
Is everyone okay?
Dad!
Mom!
I'm so, so sorry.
I was wrong and
you were right.
I'll even repeat it
if you want me to.
I can't do this on my own.
I need you. I need your help.
Max, how did you do it?
How did you reverse
the spell?
I didn't.
Seriously, what is
with all this hugging?
You don't know
who I am, do you?
Sorry.
Wait.
I do know you.
You work at the resort.
Jerry: The other day
at the pool
When you guys were asking
about reversing that spell,
you...
Who are you guys?
Hey, dad.
Theresa: "dad"?
You didn't tell me
you were married.
What?
Would somebody
please explain to me
what's going on?
Theresa: No.
This is ridiculous.
Would you
listen to yourselves?
Three kids...
I'm a 16-year-old girl.
Will you please stop
calling me a kid?
That was actually
one of our issues.
Okay. Three whatevers.
Okay, fine. I think
I liked "kids" better.
Theresa: Three kids show up
and say we're their parents?
It doesn't make any sense.
I mean, I think I'd remember.
No offense,
but if you remembered,
We wouldn't be
having this problem.
And we're supposedly married.
We are not married.
She's right.
I mean, I don't get it.
I swore I would never...
Never what?
I swore I would
never fall in love
with a mortal.
And now?
Well, I... There's...
Okay. Tell me that
you're not falling for me
And then we'll know
this isn't real.
I can't tell you that.
Look, kiss. Don't kiss.
I don't have time
to be squeamish over this.
We have to do something.
He's right.
How did you do the spell
in the first place?
I did it.
But I didn't mean to, I swear.
Maybe at first
I meant it a little bit,
but then after...
I used your wand.
This wand?
Can't you do something?
No. I'm sorry.
I wish that I...
But it says here
that maybe one of you
can reverse the spell.
But you have to
be a full wizard.
The wizard competition
is years away.
People, I have minutes.
It doesn't have
to be years away.
I'm... I'm not ready.
We have to do this.
If I don't do this,
then they disappear forever.
Mom, it'll be okay.
I promise.
I'm sorry.
I think you have
the wrong woman.
I would not forget
my own kid.
I've got to go.
Mom!
So is that lady your mom?
Max, don't you remember
who that is?
Should I?
We've got to do this now.
Everybody grab the wand.
Max!
Max!
I do remember you.
Jerry: Stay focused.
It's the only way
to get him back.
It's only a matter
of minutes before time
catches up with you, too.
A full wizard
there can be but one,
All power to
a daughter or son.
To an ancient battle
transport us three,
Where one will
emerge in victory.
Justin? Dad?
(rumbling)
Alex! What the...
Ready?
What do you mean, "ready?"
wait. We don't even
have our wands.
It's simple.
Whoever captures
the power first
Keeps it all.
The loser gets nothing.
Do you understand?
And if you don't try,
it won't work. But then...
It won't even matter.
It will be too late.
We'll try our hardest.
I'm sorry.
Jerry: The rules are simple.
The only spells
you're allowed to use
Are those involving
the four elements.
Earth, air, fire and water.
What? Nobody said anything
about that! Are...
Did you know that?
I've been studying
battle spells
For the past 10 years
of my life.
Do you know
how many spells I memorized?
The best wizards
can do the most
with the least.
Good, because that's
pretty much all I've got.
Okay. Wands at the ready!
Good luck.
Good luck.
Ready. Set. Magic!
We're going. Okay.
Justin!
(grunts)
Don't scratch it.
Male greeter:
Right this way, please.
Hurry.
You're running out of time!
The lightning
really necessary?
You know how unpredictable
storms can be?
Quit doing that!
Don't look at me.
Magic does whatever it wants.
Go!
Seriously?
Sorry.
Don't know a lot of spells.
Giselle: No, Archie.
Giselle,
why are you doing this?
If you could just stop
and talk to me...
Archie, don't get me wrong,
You were a great pair of legs
when I needed them,
But I have my own now.
But I did all this
so we could be together,
for us.
Is that what you thought?
That's what you said.
I was lying.
Archie,
why don't you get
yourself a life,
Or at least
a decent magic act?
Could I at least
get a goodbye hug?
(sighs)
You.
You were that bird!
I don't know what
you're talking about.
(coughs)
Yesterday, that would
have freaked me out.
But now, I need the Stone.
I don't think so.
Look, I don't know
what is going on.
I'm not part of your world.
I do know that
I just got my heart
ripped out by this boy
That I didn't
even know I knew,
let alone loved.
And his father,
who may or may not be
my husband.
You know,
I wouldn't even mind
if he was my husband,
And these other two kids,
these wonderful kids. It's...
Look, it's a long story,
but they need that Stone,
And I intend to get it
one way or another.
I'm not letting
those kids turn me
in to the authorities.
I just got my life back.
Why don't you look at this
as a fresh start?
From what I can see,
it didn't look like
You and your daughter
got along so well.
There are a lot of moms
who'd like to be
in your position.
There isn't one.
Give me the Stone.
(laughs mockingly)
Do you mean this one?
How did...
What are you doing?
It's the first trick
of my new act.
It's a doozy.
What did you...
What are you...
(squawks)
No. You didn't.
What are you doing? Oh, no.
(squawks)
It turns out,
I like you better as a bird.
Thank you.
A little variation
of that puddle spell.
Justin!
We have to end this.
Alex: That's it.
I did it! I won!
I'm a full wizard.
Wow.
I never knew how great
this would feel.
This is amazing.
Congratulations. See?
I told you, you were ready.
Justin...
No, it's fine.
Okay. Quick!
You need to do the spell now.
Right. Okay.
But I...
I don't know what to do.
Justin, help me.
What spell do I use?
Why would I help you?
Because you're my brother.
Look, I'm sorry
you didn't...
I'm your brother?
No. No. No, Justin.
Please, please,
you can't leave me here.
Please remember. I'm Alex.
I'm your little sister.
I taunt you and
I tease you and I make
your life miserable,
But you love me anyway.
You're everything that
I've ever wanted to be.
I'm jealous of
how smart you are and
how kind and how nice.
Please don't leave me here.
I'd never leave you.
I don't know who you are,
But I believe you.
Okay. What spell do I use?
What's going on?
I don't know the situation.
No! Justin!
Justin! No!
You have to help me!
Justin should have
won this, not me!
Just be calm.
You can do this.
Reverse the spell,
don't make me
scream and yell.
Try another one. Focus.
Because of words of hate,
do not my brothers take.
(crying) I don't know
how to do this.
Please help me.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I think it's too late.
No, it can't be too late.
Theresa: Hey!
Would this help?
The Stone.
Be careful.
You only have one wish.
But if you do it right,
you can get
your brothers back
And still be a full wizard.
Just wish for them
to reappear.
Okay?
But...
No.
No, it's much more than that.
I want everything to be
exactly the way it was.
(gasps)
Theresa: Alex?
Mom?
The minute Justin
tried to magically
glue me to my chair,
I knew something was up.
You will just
not stop, will you?
Mom!
I am so, so sorry.
I could never hate you.
I love you.
You know that, right?
And I'm not
just saying that.
I mean that.
Well, yeah, of course
I know that, honey.
But you're still grounded.
Yes, I know.
I can't wait to be grounded.
Ground me,
take away my magic,
I don't care.
Okay. As long as you've
learned your lesson.
Justin: Hey, Alex!
Justin! Max!
You miss your brothers?
Justin! Max!
Hey.
What did you do?
You gave up your powers.
You won.
Why would you do that?
Because I wanted
to make sure that
nothing was different,
That nothing changed.
Next time this comes around,
I am not taking it easy.
Whatever.
Like you were taking it easy.
No. No. No.
With all the puddles...
Yo! People.
Hey, I'm right here.
Yes, you are,
and I love you for that.
What?
Jerry: Hey. What is going on?
Hugging. I'm not
quite sure I know why.
Dad!
Justin: Mom!
Theresa: A lot of hugging.
Hey.
Okay.
Excuse me. Alex.
Theresa: Honey.
Right, Javier.
Alex, honey,
if you want to go
for an hour,
I'd be okay with that.
Well, I wouldn't be.
Javier, why don't you go
find someone else
Who doesn't have their mom
watching out for them?
Yeah. Goodbye!
Here, I'll take a picture.
I'll set it up.
That's okay.
I think we have
enough pictures.
Besides,
I'll definitely remember
this moment without one.
(speaks Spanish)
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, I got a great idea.
Let's go see some
wizard sites.
Alex: No. I don't think so.
No. This is a vacation, honey.
Stupid bird.
Jerry: Hey, don't laugh.
That's good luck, honey.
