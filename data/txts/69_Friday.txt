I know you don't smoke weed.
I know this.
But I'm gonna get you high today.
Because it's Friday.
You ain't got no job.
And you ain't got shit to do.
Dang, he at it again.
My daddy caught him trying to break
in to my house two days ago.
- And beat him down.
For real?
Mama.
Help.
Ha, you little rat bastards.
Gotta start the day off right, man.
Give me the two-piece special,
lots of hot sauce.
And all the fries you can give me.
Thank you. Thank you.
For most people, Friday's just a day
before the weekend.
But after this Friday the
neighborhood will never be the same.
Shit.
- What's up?
- Good morning.
Are you prepared for Jehovah's return?
Because if you not,
I have a pamphlet here that...
Well, fuck you.
Half-dead motherfucker.
Come on, sister.
Dana.
- What?
- Do me a favor.
What, Craig?
Hook me up with Debbie.
No.
- Why not?
- Because she about to graduate.
She ain't got no time
to be messing with you.
Come on, Dana.
No.
Plus, Joi will kick your ass anyway.
Joi ain't gonna do a goddamn thing.
Craig, get out of my room.
Shut up.
You need to be up anyway.
- What time is it?
- Twelve-thirty.
For real? Damn.
Yeah.
I got you.
I got you, baby.
All right.
Damn.
Ain't nothing in this house.
Shit.
Every time I come in the kitchen,
you in the kitchen...
...in the goddamn refrigerator...
...eating up all the food.
All the chicken.
All the pig feet.
You ate my dinner. My mashed potatoes.
And the good old gravy I like,
the biscuits I like to sop that gravy.
You ate all that up.
You drink up the milk,
don't care what kind of milk it is.
You don't care, 2 percent,
3 percent, buttermilk.
Patent milk, pull the cow on
a patent milk can, I bet you eat that too.
What's wrong with you?
All I have is my grapes.
You gonna eat up all my grapes.
- Man...
- Now, when I went to bed last night...
...didn't I tell you to take out the trash?
Yeah.
So why didn't you do it?
- I fell asleep.
- I wish you was sleeping now.
I'd knock your head with a left hook...
...make your ass wake you up
and take out that damn trash.
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
I'm throwing this away.
We ain't even got no milk.
You better eat that damn cereal.
You ain't got no damn milk, goddamn bitch.
When I was coming up, we didn't have
milk, cereal, a bowl to eat in.
Spoon, fork and knife.
No napkins or nothing.
You do like this.
And put your hands like this.
- You ever do that?
- No.
Have you ever had government cheese?
- Craig, government cheese, you had some?
- No.
Big stinking government cheese.
Couldn't take a dump for two weeks.
Eat it on the 4th, by the 18th,
everybody trying to get to the bathrooms.
I wanna eat some of them chitlins,
I love pig feet.
The barbecue pig feet were gone.
You got grease all over your mouth.
I had a sweet potato pie,
you ate the pie.
Left me that little plastic thing there.
You ain't got no damn milk.
Ain't that a bitch? You funny.
You're my boy.
You remind me of my granddaddy.
You know what your problem is?
You think money grows on trees.
Just go out, pick you 4 or $500 and go off
and just dance and eat chicken and dance.
You just having all the fun
in the world.
You know how many stinking dogs
I gotta catch...
...to fill that big ass bowl
you got there, boy?
Forty-five, 50 dogs.
Stinking, nasty dogs and 12 of them little
stinking things they call a chihuahua.
You better put some water
on that shit, boy.
All right, I'll eat it.
Hey, hey, hey.
Take the garbage out front, son.
What is wrong with him?
Hurry up with the garbage.
I got some more work for you.
What's up, Craig?
Don't "what's up" me.
I need to whoop your little ass
for knocking over these trash cans.
Don't knock these over.
Man, ain't nobody gonna knock over
your stupid trash cans.
You bet not.
Get that little bad ass in school anyway.
- Man, shut up, punk.
- What?
- I'm gonna knock over your trash cans.
- Better run.
Little bastard.
- Hey, Mama.
- Hi, baby.
- How you doing?
- Fine.
Oh, what you cooking?
I'm making some eggs, bacon, sausage,
pancakes, and some leftover pork chops.
Yeah. Cook it up.
Mama, you got some glue?
- For what?
- My track slipped out.
- Go look in my dresser.
- You need a wig.
You need a job.
Hook.
Mom, you didn't tell Daddy
what happened yesterday, did you?
You know I wouldn't tell on my baby.
Cool.
Craig!
Come in here.
Where you at?
In the bathroom.
I'll wait till you come out.
Bring your ass in here.
What you talking about?
I smelled your shit for 22 years,
now you can't smell mine for five minutes.
Shut the door.
Your mama told me
what happened to you yesterday.
- What?
- That was stupid.
How the hell you go get fired
on your day off?
I don't know.
Well, you need a trade.
Take a look at that paper over there
on the counter there.
I ain't trying to be no dog catcher.
Why not?
George Clinton was a dog catcher.
- No, he wasn't.
- Sure he was. That's why he said:
Do the dog catcher, dog catcher
I don't even like dogs.
That's the beauty of it.
I grab a dog...
...and I choke him,
and I kick the shit out of him...
...and I...
All day long, my foot up a dog's ass.
Just bang, bang, bang up his ass.
That's my pleasure.
I don't think so.
I'll tell you one thing.
Around here,
you gonna work or go to school.
The first of the month, rent is due.
If you ain't got nothing on the table,
you don't worry about catching a dog.
You gotta worry about a dog
catching your ass.
What's up?
Nothing.
Where's Debbie at?
Oh, she's at the house.
Craig, can I use y'all's microwave
right quick?
Yeah, what'd you gotta cook?
Some chicken.
- Give it here, I'll do it.
- No.
See, I was hoping that I could take it
to the house with me.
My microwave?
Yeah.
That's like me asking
to use your air condition.
You know,
if we had a air conditioner...
...I would let you use...
Craig.
- Damn.
Telephone.
- Hello.
- Who you go to the show with last night?
I didn't go to the show last night.
You ain't got to lie.
Craig, you ain't got to lie.
Ain't nobody lying.
I didn't go to the show.
Yes, you did. Because my sister-in-law's
baby cousin, Traci...
...she went to the show last night, she saw
you there all hugged up with some tramp.
Now tell me who she was.
Your sister-in-law's baby cousin, Traci,
is a goddamn...
Yeah, she a liar.
She ain't seen me at no movies
hugged up with nobody.
Yeah, yeah. Well, let me tell you what.
You just tell the bitch, whoever she is,
when I catch her, I'm gonna beat her ass.
That girl gone.
I don't know why you messing
with that little fast-assed girl anyway.
Now that other girl, Debbie? She's cute.
She's in school. She has all her teeth.
I don't know what her sister's doing.
I'm trying to get with her,
but Dana won't even hook me up.
I told you to hook yourself up.
You need to hook up them clippers
and get the back of that neck.
Don't even talk
with all the horses missing their hair here.
- Oh. Here you go.
Hey, it's too early.
Hey, it's too early.
Now, Craig,
you know what your problem is?
You have no game.
What you know about game?
I got all the game.
Now, your father?
He got game.
Don't nobody go in the bathroom
for about 35, 45 minutes.
Somebody open a window.
You call that game?
There go my ride.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye-bye, honey.
- I gotta go.
- Bye, Daddy.
Bye-bye, baby.
Craig, you listen to me.
I want you to get your ass up today,
go out and look for a job.
The word today is job.
J- O-B.
- You hear me?
Yeah.
You go look for a job today.
I'm not kidding.
Open all the windows.
Damn, it stinks in here.
Where mine at?
Oh, I didn't say I was cooking nothing
for you. This is for me.
Have some cereal.
We ain't got no milk.
Use water. It won't hurt.
Oh, man.
- Huh?
- Nothing.
Break yourself, fool.
Look what you did to my curtain.
Better watch who window you climbing in

Damn.
What's up, Big Worm?
How much you got left?

I don't wanna have to fuck you up,
Smokey.
Playing with my money

Worm.
Hey, you the last brother money

And you know this, man.
We'll see.
Old Florida Evans-looking motherfucker.

They ain't got me on tape.
She said they did.
Fired me on the spot.
Talking about pressing charges.
Goddamn, you got to be a stupid

Oh, goddamn.
Man, look.

Yeah, well, yeah.
She blacker than a motherfucker too.
I ain't fucking with you. Watch out.
She wanted to give me the ass

I wonder where she going.
She probably going to that new health club

- Oh, so they opened that already?
- Yep.
I heard they hiring too.
You need to go down there and see

Hey, hold up. My mom's in there.
She about to go to work though.
Hey.

Oh. That bike.

You wanna borrow my car?
Hell, no.

You need to borrow a job,

Always trying to smoke up

Oh, man.

You know how it is around here.
Oh, no, son. That's not the way it is.
You kids today ain't nothing but punks.
Sissified.
So quick to pick up a gun.
You scared to take an ass whipping.
This what makes you a man.
When I was growing up,

You win some, you lose some.
But you live,

You think you're a man
with that gun in your hand, don't you?
I'm a man without it.
Put the gun down.
Come on, put up your dukes.
Now you're a man.
Your uncle picked up a gun too.
He had to find out the hard way.
Twenty-two years old.
You got a choice.

Who do you think you are?

My sister don't need to steal nothing

- I'm not scared of you.
All these niggers around here
might be scared of you.
But I'm not.
- You take your ass home.

You're lucky I'm not a man.
Otherwise, I'd kick your ass myself.
Shut up!
Deebo, man. You tripping.

Man, that's a female.
Shut your little punk ass up, nigger,
before I drop you like I did this bitch.
Man, I ain't even trying to fight you,

What you gonna do with that
besides make me mad?
Put the gun down, son.

Now who's the punk?
- He think he a mack.
- Macaroni.
You got knocked the fuck out, man.
Give me my goddamn money.
Payback's a motherfucker,
ain't it, nigger?
China, come on.
No, Ma.
Stop, you're embarrassing me.
My grandmama gave me this chain.
Deebo!
Man, you should've been
bobbing and weaving. Look at you.
Get up!
Since you ain't getting up,
I'll take these shoes.
Bigfoot motherfucker,
you can have your knife.
Because I steal, I don't kill.
Craig, yeah.
How's your back feeling?
It be cool.
Bleeding and shit.
What time you waking up
in the morning?
Eight-thirty, why?
I was just wondering that maybe
if you were feeling better, um...
...that you could come over.
I'm feeling better already.
I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
All right.
Eight-thirty, right?
Yes.
Hey, 7:30.
That's right.
Craig, come here.
Craig.
Shut the door and have a seat.
Can I leave the door open?
Shut the door.
Now you see, son. You gotta let us know
when you leave the house.
What if you got killed tonight?
We'd have to bury you.
You know how much a funeral costs
these days?
No.
About 4 or $5000.
I ain't got no 4 or $5000
to plant you in the ground.
- You understand?
- Yeah.
You keep your ass around this house.
Your supervisor called about your job.
She wants you to call tomorrow.
For real?
Now, Craig...
...I was proud of you tonight.
You used your brain.
That's what I want you to do,
use your brain.
That's my boy.
Night, Mama.
Night, baby.
Dana.
Hello?
Why you can't call nobody back?
Which one of your hoes
has somebody shooting at you?
See, I don't know why I waste my time
on your old stupid ass anyway.
I don't know either.
It's over.
Bitch!
Yeah, I got your money.
I don't appreciate you sending
your punk-ass, bust-ass...
...Jheri-curl-ass friends
to shoot at me and my homey.
They like to got dealt with.
Don't be calling here
like you some straight up G...
...because I'll cut your balls off
and hand them to you partner.
I had to warn you too many times
about my money Smokey.
It's the principle of the whole thing.
It's principalities in this.
Well...
Yeah, hey, I got your money anyway.
And you sell that shit yourself next time.
Because I'm going to rehab.
I'm through with this shit.
I was just bullshitting.
And you know this, man.
