What would you do, if you knew you only have one day
or one week, or one month to live.
I am afraid that it's not a great news.
We have picked up cancar cells in
your blood, your liver and your lymph nodes.
We need to get the treatment right away
How bad is it?
It's stage four.
How many stages are there?
Four.
Here are the first three unfiltered thoughts
that went through Ben's head.
He was calling off the wedding.
Relief because he can use this as an excuse
to get out of marking
six classes of English exams.
How many people would come to his funeral.
The fourth thought, he voiced aloud
Are you sure you have made some kind of mistake?
You know, I feel fine.
We are sure.
So, what are you saying here?
You have a unextremely aggressive form of cancer.
You need an aggressive treatment.
What about my chances?
I got a scale of 1-10.
The survival rate is about 10%.
I am gonna die?
When dealing with individual, we through the odds out.
In some cases, a complete recovery is unheared of.
And if the treatments do not work, how long do I have?
A couple of years.
At mimimum?
So, what is the minimum?
There isn't one.
- You are right, son?  - Yeah.
I'm ok, thanks.
You ride?
No, for a couple of years.
I expect it would be sold.
My... eyes had gone. I couldn't get my license renewed.
I would never really believe that you have old bones.
I tell ya, it's a blink from diversity depense.
Take for a ride?
No, thanks. I am not in the market for a bike.
Of course you not.
One might conclude that the opportunity to buy a motorcycle
so soon after hearing Ben's cataclysmic news,
might be divine and intervention.
That would be erroneous.
In fact, Ben has been circling around the purchaser for a while.
But before we proceed further, a bit of the back story.
Gerald Benjamin Tyler was born on January 14th 1979 in Toronto, Canada.
Temperature was unseasonablly
-19 degree Celslius.
It has been 12 years since the Lives
had last won Stanley Cup.
So, what would Ben's life changing moments?
All I want to see out there today is a hansel.
Keep your eyes on the ball.
Tyler!
Perhaps, maybe if you stop sticking your finger up your nose every two minutes,
you might actually catch the ball.
Never again would Ben be caught
picking his nose in public.
and never again would he be caught daydreaming.
The two acts seem to go hand in hand
or finger in nose, if you will.
The second seismic event.
Ben's parents have brought Ben
into believing he had the voice of an angel.
However the dream died during the auditions
for the school production of H.M.S. Pinafore.
He is an Englishman.
Enough! Enough!
Stop before you make my ears bleed.
It was dreadful!
Ben never sang in public again.
However, Mrs. Bell's derogatory remarks
were intended as an act of revenge.
Bell's big butt.
The third event. Ben's first novel.
A thinly weird autobiography failed to find a publishing home.
He had created an orphan.
How different things might have been for Ben.
Had his nose-picking and daydreaming been able to continue?
Had he believed praise when he heard?
And had he decided to against all hope
to send his manuscript to HarperCollins
for there had recently hired a young editor
who was on the power for the just type of
literary offering that Ben had produced.
Five minutes left, everybody.
Ben taught the same books that he had been taught.
that his father had been taught
that all likelihood
Shakespeare's father had been taught
It wouldn't be entirly untrue to suggest
that the teaching profession was not Ben's passion.
The one on rare occasions he did steal swing for the fancies.
'Tho' much is taken, much abides
'and tho' we are not now that strength which in the old days
'moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are
'one equal-temper of heroic hearts,
'made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
'to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
Ben was set to marry Samantha Pierce.
The wedding was planned for three mouths from now.
Hey, it that yours?
I was beginning to think that he's never going to ask me.
We all were, dear, we all were.
You did the right thing, son.
I am proud of you.
I know what you are thinking.
Ben settled for a career and now was going to settle for a wife.
But before you go too far with that theory,
You should know five things that Ben adores about Samantha.
Her left hip bum.
Not does there's anything wrong with the right,
but the left is a perfection.
The playlists.
Samantha became the factual
DJ to the soundtrack of Ben's life.
Her parents
Mary Jo and Tom are the nicest people anyone could ever meet.
Her underrated ability
to provide obscure
but yet surprisingly pergnant quotations
that always revealed a larger truth.
Samantha became a golf fan
just because she knew Ben loved the sport.
His fiancee developed an interest even in taping the delayed sinous events from the
Asian tour.
If that is not love, what is?
Though Samantha wasn't the demanding sort,
she was eminent about one thing,
she hated motorcycles.
As an act she worried, driving a motorcycle
represents the height of stupidity.
So?
I'll take it.
I am not surprised.
The price is not negotiable.
OK.
Hell, I give you a tip of seven.
You really don't have to.
No, I insist.
What do you find while you are riding?
I don't know yet.
Upon hearing the news of his cancer,
Ben's plan has been to go to the home to tell Samantha about his prognosis
and hopefully make desperate love to her
all night long.
First, he needed a coffee.
Because he still had a trace of dreamer left in him.
Ben always rolled up the rim the to see if he won.
Go west young man
Ben decided to wait until after his father's birthday party
to break the news to Samantha.
She would not be able to be hid the secret
- Can I make a toast?  - Oh, my God.
Can you just send us an e-mail?
Sure, I just want to say... no.
I wanna admit that despite my growing decrepitude,
I have never been happier
I have somehow...
hold of very lucky life
And I would like to make a toast to my family.
Thank you all.
Cheers.
Cheers, Dad.
We will not cancel the wedding.
Not after all the work have put into it,
unless you want to.
No! I don't care about the wedding.
I... I care about the insanity of you going on vacation.
The longer you put off getting treatment, the worse the odds get.
I'm not going on vacation.
The second I step into the hospital, they gonna to nick upon me with drugs so powerful.
It's gonna to feel like I'm getting glass shards.
shut down my throat every time I swallow.
Before I become a patient, I need to do this.
You need to do what, exactly?
I need to have an adventure.
If this was me, I would be signing up for every treatment on the planet.
I would drink goat piss if I thought that would make it difference.
I know you would, Sam, but it's only for two days.
And when I get back, I am in the treatment, 100%, I promise.
It is incomprehensible to me that you would wait
But it is not incomprehensible to me
- I... I just need  - What?
Come with me.
Just come with me.
No, I would be too angry if you hold the time.
What about your family?
I'll tell my family when I get back.
Ben insisted that the wedding would go ahead as planned.
Because Ben missed his appointment,
nurse Forrester was able to leave work
12 minutes earlier than usual.
In a burst of power walking proudest,
she just managed to catch the 17:45 train
had geared not in a quite a stricken
she would have been one of 13 casualties on the 18:10 train.
the derail just outside the Etobicoke.
Ben in fact toyed.
Without irony, he loved these old  marshals to the world biggest.
Part of the pleasure was inventing entire back stories
about how these creations came into being.
"And I say what our town needs is something to put on the map.
Something with a big time of 'wow' factor.
The world's largest Photomosaic."
Ben remembered reading
about a man in Britain,
John Brandrick actually, who
was diagnosed with pancreas cancer
And it was given a year to live
He spent everything he had,
only to find out that it was a misdiagnosis
And he would be fine.
What if Ben was misdiagnosed?
Samantha was right.
He was swimming in that famous river in Egypt.
He would go home.
Hey, buddy.
You know if there's any Canadian Tire pretty sound?
No. Sorry, no idea.
We will lose the bet if we walk to Sudbury.
So important to find a Canadian Tire here?
Our buddy Gurvy bet a bus of beer.
- Each.  - Each , that if we could ride
From Newfoundland to Vancouver, under six weeks
And spend less than $ 400, so
Every time we have a bike down, what happens more than you think.
We simply ride to the nearest store to replace one bike for another.
Come on, there's no way that you ride a
bike all this way to the West
Why not?
You do not have any of the proper equipment.
Besides the bloody headwind, there hasn't been any problems so far.
Look, I'll give one of you guys a ride across the town for a check?
Sorry, we can not accept rides or we'll lose the bet. It's the rule number 6.
Again shit face to agree to that one.
See you later.
Best luck.
In comparison to the sheer lunacy into cycling
to the headwind to cross the country for
a case of beer,
Ben recommited to heading West.
Hi.
Are you pregnant?
I mean, I mean, are we pregnant?
No, of course not.
Why did you write a note about our... our kids?
Bacause I was pulling you a heart string.
I was throwing Ave Maria for past few months
the thought of our unborn children make you come home sooner.
But definitely you are not pregnant?
No.
No, and if I wasn't trusted I wouldn't tell you in code.
"What should we do? "...
"We should keep looking for Grumps" ...
"So they searched all day
But could not find any signs of Grumps"...
Ben's father, a rather persuasive story teller had his son
ardently convinced of the existence of Grumps.
A mythical creature so illusive
But to actually see one would bring untold good fortune.
At what point in his childhood did reason
trump in imagination and
Ben had concluded that the world was Grumpless?
Ben had a overwhelming urge to embrace of randomness
And resumed the quest for Grumps.
I need to know if you have any objections to a church wedding.
No. Of course not.
And is there anything you would like to incorporate into the wedding?
No.
Can I ask you a question, Ben?
Um... do you have any beliefs?
How can you not believe in anything?
We had a kids discussion. We had the financial discussion
How could we not have a religious discussion?
You can't be honestly that upset about this, can you?
I'm marrying a nihilist.
For Samantha's sake, Ben
Tried very hard to listen for God.
However, he could never seem to
tune in to proper divine frequency.
Hi.
Look, um...
When you said that you couldn't believe you are marrying a nihilist
Were you being insufficient?
No.
But I'm OK with this.
Just tell me when you're coming home.
That's pretty a major compromise, isn't it?
No, it's a minor compromise.
I resigned myself to the fact we don't see eye to eye on faith.
Where are you?
Are there anything more you think you compromised on?
Yes, this is pretty be in the relationship.
Well.. like what? Just, you know, an example.
Why are you even talking about this?
I was able to reschedule our commitment on Monday.
I was just a little wondering maybe one of the things you compromised on
is, in fact, one of things I like most about myself.
There's nothing major, honestly.
That's great. Maybe just a minor example then.
OK.
Um... I wish you didn't have foot odor.
But I don't have a foot odor.
This is a ridiculous conversation. Forget about it.
It is ridiculous, because you tell me that my feet stink but my feet don't stink.
Well, maybe you have a little factory of problems as well.
I never mentioned that before bacause I knew that you are sensitive about it.
Because it doesn't exist.
Trust me, they reek.
You can pay for those over there.
Actually I... I... um...
I need to ask you for a favor.
Sure.
Can you tell me if my shoe stinks?
Excuse me?
I know that sounds absurd, but it's really really important to me.
Feel fit to be brutally honest.
Well, in my professional opinion...
it's fine.
Ben wondered about the larger implication that
Samantha's hostility to the alleged foot fault
The more important consideration
Why didn't Samantha ask him what he didn't like aboout her?
You are the northern?
Yeah.
Where you headed?
West.
Somewhere in the west, in particular?
Not yet.
So you've got direction, but not...
destination.
Yes, that's about sums it up.
You know that marijuana has been medically approved for cancer patients
What? Some kind of psychic?
No.
But why did you bring up cancer?
I had an asshole followid at once.
So you got the treatment?
Actually, he wanted a way on it's own.
Seriously?
I wish ... man.
I got treatment.
You married?
Engaged.
How about you? Wife?
25 years. Her name was Conny.
Really? What were you for when you got married?
17, actually.
You still in love?
Yeah.
How did you know what was the real thing?
If you gotta ask...
you're not.
And you already knew that.
That which we are, we are. - Ulysses, Alfred Tennyson
Diana?
This was the farthest west world that Terry had run.
But of course that he never stopped dreaming of getting
back on the road and touching the Pacific.
"All I can say is that if there is any way for me to get back
I'll finishwhat I will."
Hello?
What are you doing?
I'm trying on my sister's wedding dress.
What happened to the one you have made?
I guess I have to remake that dress
Again?
Yes, again.
Does it grab your boobs funny?
Yeah...
Did you have anything to do with your boobs not to the dresses?
You come home.
Please?
I'm not ready yet, Sam
- I... um...  - What are you doing?
Well, I was... just came into the ring to get out of the heat and I...
And... what?
Well, I thought it was having a heatstroke.
I mean, not thinking was the real Stanley Cup.
That is the real Stanley Cup, right?
Yes, of course it is.
What are you doing here?
It is Derek Vincent's day in Manitoba since I won the cup.
Expositary fact
Each member of the Stanley Cup champions has the possession of the cup for 24 hours.
Derek was on the hour 7.
- You are Derek Vincent?  - I am.
Congratulations, man.
Thanks.
Where's the guy for the commercial?
You know, the kind of white gloves the guard with his life.
In fact, I have got a couple of advices to distract.
To be a moment only with the cup, you know?
I could never get the... right?
I left the game halfway through the game with a concussion, so...
Yes, I remember that fight.
Everybody remember that fight, except me
I guess you want me to leave, huh?
No.
True fact.
Doctors had diagnosed Cheryl O'Reilly as an inferior...
One night, Mike Ricci Colorado Avalanche brought the Cup to a party.
Cheryl kissed it and nine months later, Stanley was born.
You want to kiss the cup?
Hope it brings you good luck.
Yeah.
felt that the ghosts of all the players who have ever kissed the Cup
might just be able to body check his cancer into oblivion.
# I saw a beaver, I saw a goose #
# Riding the railroad with a two four of Moose #
# I got together with God and we stand #
# We sank in the snowball field, we thought we were on land #
# Oh, I'm from Canada #
# Oh, that's my home, oh Canada #
# Oh, that's my home, oh Canada #
Then again, perhaps his karma was irreparably screwed.
Wasn't the hockey stick and the Stanley Cup enough for one day?
Why did Ben still insist
on taking a dubious de tour
to the world's largest prairie camel?
Just do me right now.
Please, please, please, please...
Start, damned!
Fuck!
Damned!
Not here, not now...
God!
Oh! Come on!
Please, please. Don't do this right now.
Don't do this...
Damn it!
Why?
Why won't you start!
You have a new voice message.
Hey, I'm in Calendar, window seat
and I'm just reading about why Phil missed the cut.
Please call me.
If Ben's lifetime could
be coffee and newspapers with Samantha,
existence would be bliss.
I don't know how to thank you.
Most people wouldn't call, do you realized?
Well, they just kept on going.
It was not anything, really.
I'm sorry about your dog.
You know, the thing is...
Rudy slept in my bed longer than two husbands...
combined.
That's first time I cry in ten years.
Oh, looks like you got some dirty gas.
Is that serious?
No.
I just clean it up, won't take me long.
I never expected to end up twice divorced
and only see my son once a year if I'm lucky.
He lives with his dad?
He just turned 20.
Besides, his father won't aid well long before that happened.
Come on, you do not have a 20-year-old son?
Yeah.
And a granddaughter who just turned 4.
I've only seen once.
My son works in Fort McMurray.
The money is too good to keep him down here.
Why don't you leave?
Do something else.
I am too in debt.
And if the weather and the markets don't go the shit,
I might breakeven my loan payments at the end of the harvest.
I feel like an idiot if every farmer around here
wasn't in the same boat.
Does it make you bitter?
That's the thing, no.
The dirt has a way of hitching your pores.
Oh, if I can get laid every now and again, I might feel a lot happier.
No offense, but I like my man XXL.
Besides, when I make my move,
it usually involves few wine coolers
and a complete lack of subtlety.
Well, let's go for a horse ride.
You know, actually I uh...  I've never ridden on the horse.
Oh, well obviously you've never lived.
# Never felt so good, never thought I am word #
# Again, now you're all alright #
# Look what I can see, everything we used to be, is back and now you're alright #
When I came out here, I think where else we really want to go.
Looking out over the hills,
wondering if a former life he had been a cowboy,
part of Ben wished Fran wasn't so
rigid about the size requirements of her man.
He also wished he had a case of wine coolers.
- Better than ever.  - Yes it is.
Ben's trip rekindled Fran's wanderlust.
That weekend,
instead of fixing fences,
Fran paid a surprise visit to her son in Fort McMurray.
Unfortunately, Brad was on a double shift.
The upshot, while killing time,
Fran finally met the lover for life.
Excuse me,
can you tell me where Dawson Street is?
"Welcome to Alberta: Wild Rose Country"
The world's largest Tipi was a major disappointment,
Ben couldn't say why.
He actually expected more
from the world's largest dinosaur.
It was a 3 out of 10.
Maybe 3 and a half.
As most of you are probably already aware,
Dinosaur Provincial Park is home to the largest collection
of dinosaur bones in the world.
Only rivaled by China's Gobi Desert.
It makes you feel sort of insignificant, doesn't it?
Knowing that the most powerful species on the planet has been completely wiped out
reduced to a pile of bones.
One might conclude roaming somewhere
among the bones of these ancient beasts,
Grumps would sure be hidden.
Instead, Ben wondered if like their prehistoric friends,
the Grumps would be extinct.
True story.
In 1997, Gina Lalapola, an Italian stripper,
suffocated to death while waiting
to jump out of the cake.
The point is we are all on borrowed time.
One minute you're trying to
find a decent song on the radio,
the next...
What is the minimum in life?
And so, inexplicably happy to be alive,
Ben tried to recreate one of those moving moments,
the kind where the hero dancers
uninhibitedly finally able to symbolically
throw of the shackles of convention
through the transformative power of a pop song.
# I need you here tonight #
# You make things right #
# Well every time I see you #
# It's gonna be a nice day #
Ben however couldn't pull of the feat.
He felt like an idiot trying to be that guy.
Moreover, he couldn't dance.
Six hours of relentless cold
and Ben decided that he had enough of the allure
of the open road and lack of the itinerary.
Not saving for the retirement had its advantages.
Mom and Dad are freaking out. We're all freaking out.
Get back to Toronto and deal with this.
Ben, it's your mother. I need to hear your voice.
I love you so so much.
Hi, son, we can handle this.
I called Dr. Morgan and he is able to get you
with the top cancer specialist Sunnybrook.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
Could you give your mother a call, please?
# Let's go out, we'll take no prisoners #
# Lonely love, gotta leave it behind #
# We look like a million dollars #
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind  #
# Let's get wrecked on Rolling Rock, and stroll down to the sea #
# I'll come to my senses there and then you'll come to me #
# Let's forget about all our friends and family #
# Let's forget about all our lovers, enemies #
# Let's go out when the sun goes down #
# Let's wrestle this city to the ground #
# We'll go out, we'll take no prisoners #
# Lonely love we leave it behind #
# We look like a million dollars #
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind #
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind #
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind #
Thank you very much.
I'll meet you anywhere.
You promised not to tell anyone.
I know.
And you promised that you gonna be come back in two days.
Are you coming home?
Not yet.
Then I will go to you.
You will?
Yeah.
Where are you?
Banff.
I'll book a flight tomorrow.
Bye.
Ben knew that
with someone else along for the ride,
looking for Grumps would seem idiotic.
Within two hours of
escaping the Presidential suite,
he was lost.
If he got to the Pacific Ocean
and ran out of west. What would he do?
Oh, my God
Jesus!
God boy, good boy!
Mick, down!
Down!
I'm so sorry. I didn't expect to see anybody up here.
It's ok. It just caught me off guard is all.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. I just, I'm a...
I feel a little lightheaded.
- You want some water or something?  - Yeah, sure. Thanks.
# Un Canadien errant #
# Banni de ses foyers #
You know the song?
Yeah.
# Un Canadien errant #
That was a supreme understatement.
Ben's mother had sung "Un Canadien errant",
a French Canadian folk song
to him every night growing up.
The words were embedded in his DNA.
Of all the songs Tracy could pick,
that she chose this one had to mean something.
# Des pays ¨¦trangers. #
All right
The ground rules of the campfire sing-along
clearly state that everyone has to participate.
Honestly, you don't want me to sing.
Really. I insist.
# Si tu vois mon pays #
# Mon pays malheureux #
# Si tu vois mon pays #
Ben had never taken a complete inventory
of things he found unappealing about Samantha.
She was a routine girl.
Everything had to be done in a certain order.
Deviating from this costs
sleepless and general irritability.
In spite of Ben's efforts, Samantha steadfastly refused to
quantify movies, books and
behavior of members of his family
on the 1 to 10 scale.
A major disappointment to Ben,
as this had to be the filter through which he classified many parts of his life.
Ben regretted how their sex life
has lost some of its earlier carnal urgency.
Do you mind if we wait until tomorrow?
And finally, most annoying of all,
Samantha's jaw clicked when she ate.
Ben was certain that as the years went by,
he would see still even notice it.
(French song: Un Canadien errant) # Va, dis ¨¤ mes amis #
# Que je me souviens d'eux #
# Va, dis ¨¤ mes amis #
# Que je me souviens d'eux #
You have a fantastic voice.
It's nice of you to say that. I've long since given up
on the hope that I can sing.
Well, I have perfect pitch, and you can definitely sing.
That was dreadful!
My fourth grade teacher lied to me.
What are you talking about?
It's not important.
So what's your second book about?
I didn't write a second novel.
Any ideas or...
I don't know. Oh, no. Rejection pretty much killed my creativity.
You know, my grandfather used to quote Thomas Edison to me
ad nauseam when I was a kid.
His favorite line,
"Many of life's failures are people who did not realize
how close they were to success when they gave up."
Ok, but there's perseverance, and then it's just delusion.
Well, I guess somebody gonna to fill the world's delusional quotation.
What would you do if you have one week to live?
Maybe just do what I'm doing right now.
My mind is not on tomorrow or
yesterday, or even three hours from now. It's just here.
What would you do?
I'll make love to you.
Why?
I am just searching for a moment.
Samantha had managed to book a flight out that night
instead of next morning as planned.
When Ben woke, he was deliriously content.
Maybe it was the fact that somehow,
he has managed to outrun his demons.
But this road made a lot more sense
than treatment.
Where were you all night?
How can you just forgive me?
Aren't you upset?
Of course I'm upset.
But at least you didn't lie about it.
And you are completely messed up right now.
So I'm telling myself it's not even about us.
Maybe later, I'll be angry.
But right now we have bigger things to deal with.
Like why wouldn't you come home.
I just can't.
It's selfish.
It's... it's incomprehensible.
You're being an asshole. Get treatment.
Do you really think there's no hope?
I don't want to be a patient yet.
Not if there's no point.
So you just wanna keep running
without even fighting? Of course, there's a point.
What if this is fighting?
What if this is the right thing to do?
I know,
everything has changed.
But Why? What happened?
Because it couldn't be just about the diagnosis.
Because, Samantha, I am staring at a wall that I cannot get over.
Because I don't know what the good answers are anymore.
How about being honest?
Ok.
Do you wanna know what the first thing that went through my mind was
when the doctor told me that I had cancer?
The very first thing?
That is I wanted to call off the wedding.
I was absolutely positive that I didn't want to get married,
and I didn't want to go back to work, and really, I didn't want to do anything.
That's a normal reaction. Even I wanted to call off the wedding.
But, Samantha, it's not about the cancer.
It's about the life that I built for myself.
Why am I over insured?
Why do I care so much about being responsible all the time?
Why do I give a shit about what kind of appliances we're putting into our kitchen?
I am becoming my father. And no offense to my father, I love him.
He is a decent man, but that was never my life's ambition.
So what's the alternative then?
This!
This is the alternative.
You can't just keeping driving around forever.
At some point, this is gonna catch up with you.
Especially you.
I just want time.
If I can take each one of these days and turn them into life,
and then it has to be a better choice.
But you don't have to be dead.
You know that you are allowed to go against the odds.
You are allowed to do this for us.
This isn't about us.
That's the problem, Samantha. This is about me.
Did you ever love me?
Not the way you deserved.
So why did you asked me to marry you then?
Because so much of me wanted to.
And because I couldn't think of a reason why not to anymore.
I never thought that... what we had was a fallback position.
A safe choice.
How could I not have seen it?
All the indecision, all the hesitation,
they're always about us,
not about you.
I'm an idiot.
Samantha.
Don't you dare follow me.

# Make a boat out of this cigarette pack #
# Watch it float away and hope it comes back #
Shut up!
Hi, Mom.
# I got out of bed today, Swear to God I couldn't see my face #
# I got out of bed today, staring at a ghost #
# Who forgot to float away, didn't have all that much to say #
# Wouldn't even tell me his own name. Where'd my body go? #
# Where oh where'd my body go? Africa or Mexico? #
# Where or where'd my body go? Where'd my body go? #
# Oh. Have you seen my ghost? Seen my ghost, seen my ghost? #
# Oh. Have you seen my ghost? Staring at the ground? #
It's great, thanks.
Enjoy.
Excuse me.
Can you help us make a picture?
Sure.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
- You are welcome.  - You are Canadian, ya?
Yeah.
I wanna say that you live in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.
I know.
Their love wasn't an illusion.
However, like most relationships,
there were a few roar waves that could have capsized it.
In those times of rough seas,
Ben's photograph was a touch tone for what was best.
# Bad day, looking for a way home #
# Looking for the great escape #
# Gets in his car and drives away, far from all the things that we are #
# Puts on a smile and breathes it in and breathes it out, he says #
# Bye bye bye to all of the noise #
# Oh, he says, bye bye bye to all of the noise #
# Hey, child, things are looking down #
# That's okay, you don't need to win anyways #
# Don't be afraid, just eat up all the gray and it will fade all away #
# Don't let yourself fall down #
No one can say with any amount of certainty
what Grumps actually looks like.
He is hard to pin down that way.
However, a good rule of thumb his father always believed,
You'll definitely know him when you see him.
And Ben was positively certain,
that the universe had coughed up at Grumps.
There's only one thing to do.
# I don't fight, and I don't steal #
# I might believe in things that you don't think are real #
# I know my wrong and I can learn to fight #
# I keep my heart on the outside so it can see more life #
# See more life #
You smell like the sea.
What is the divorce rate?
56%.
That's not very good odds.
They're better than one in ten.
Yeah, I suppose they are.
When you deal with individuals, you throw out the numbers.
You have to.
Does it need to be over?
I asked a man when I was on the road,
"How do you know you're in love?"
He told me, "If you have to ask,
you're not."
You never had to ask anyone, did you, Sam?
No.
Of course not.
Are you angry?
Yeah.
And not just about that.
Of all the various ways this sucks,
I'm obsessed with a completely selfish idea
that everybody is gonna think that she is a woman
who left her fianc¨¦ because he had cancer.
I'm not gonna think that.
But I think of that about someone if I heard that.
I'm sorry I got us into this mess.
You should be.
How are you feeling?
Ancient.
Is your trip worthy?
Yeah.
Did you take pictures?
A lifetime's worth.
# Night can't come quick enough #
# My faults shine in the sun #
# Real girls don't take aim, like kings do these days #
# I made my mind up to be a black-winged bird #
# Never turn my head for how things were #
# Things we can't change #
When you get those rare moments of clarity,
those flashes when the universe makes sense,
you tried desperately to hold on to them.
They are the life boats for the darker times
when the vastness of all,
the incomprehensible nature of life
is completely illusive.
So the question becomes, or should be all along,
what would you do if you know you only have one day
or one week, or one month to live?
What life boat would you grab onto?
What secret would you tell?
What band would you see?
What person would you declare your love to?
What wish would you fulfill?
What exotic locale would you fly to for a coffee?
What book would you write?
