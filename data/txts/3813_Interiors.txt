I had dropped out of
law school when l met Eve.
She was very beautiful.
Very pale, cool in her black dress,
with never anything more
than a single strand ofpearls.
And distant.
Always poised and distant.
By the time the girls were born,
it was all so perfect, so ordered.
Looking back, ofcourse, it was rigid.
The truth is
she'd created a world
around us that we existed in,
where everything had its place, where
there was always a kind ofharmony.
Great dignity.
I will say... it was like an ice palace.
Then suddenly one day,
out ofnowhere,
an enormous abyss
opened up beneath our feet
and l was staring into
a face l didn't recognise.
"The basic popularity and appeal of Mao
for so-called American Marxists."
This is supposed to go in the sequence -
in under the sequence
in reel two about South Africa.
um... what we wanna
do is get two examples.
The idea is his style was
Marxist-Leninist - Mao's style -
but that he was accessible to the lower
classes because of his use of homilies.
An example is: "The hardest thing is to
act properly throughout one's whole life."
What the hell does that mean?
Or, even worse...
(buzzer)
(sighs)
Eve. I wasn't expecting you.
- I hope l'm not disturbing you.
- No. I just couldn't imagine who it was.
- Is Joey here? Where's Joey?
- In the shower. Can l get you anything?
Oh, just some coffee, if you don't mind.
No, it's no trouble at all.
I think l've found a very
nice vase for the foyer.
uh-huh.
You'll probably think it's an extravagance,
but it's not, all things considered.
These pieces are
becoming increasingly rare.
Isn't that exquisite?
I hope you like it, because
it's perfect for the foyer.
We already have a vase in the foyer, Eve.
Yes, but this will never look
right when we redo the floors.
I've never understood
why they have to be redone.
What? We discussed all that, Michael.
Don't you remember? You agreed.
It costs money to have these things done
and redone two and three times over.
But the... It's such a large floor space.
We agreed the paler tones would
make a more subtle statement.
Pale woods would be lovely.
I never agreed about anything.
I'm always being told.
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- How would you put it?
First the living room
was finished, then it wasn't.
Then the bedroom needed more work.
Now the floors have to be stripped.
- You picked the sofa, then you hated it.
- It was a lovely piece.
It just was the wrong scale.
This is not an exact science.
Sometimes you just have to see it,
then you get the feel of it.
- You didn't like that in the bedroom?
- I get better use out of it here.
If you utilised it in here, that's fine.
It's meant to be used,
but it was part of what we
were doing in the bedroom.
It's the shade and the bedspread, they
set each other off so nicely. I thought...
- How much is the vase?
- They're asking $400.
- Give me a break, Eve.
- All right, Michael. I'll return it.
(traffic noise)
Would you mind closing the window?
The street noises are just unnerving.
- I hope you aren't having an argument.
- (Eve) Not at all.
Oh, l love that suit. It's a unique colour.
Renata calls it ice grey.
It makes you look very beautiful.
Isn't she beautiful, Michael?
- Very lovely.
- I don't feel lovely.
I've been running up and down
Second Avenue all day.
Oh, wow. Is this for us? lt's exquisite.
- No. I was just showing it to Michael.
- It's too expensive.
Really? Well, that's too bad.
- Eve, let's keep it.
- No, no.
Yeah. It's very beautiful.
We'll work something out.
No, l was just carried away by it.
I don't know why.
Guess it's because it's so unique.
But it is an extravagance.
I'll just look for something along
the same lines at a better price.
But this really belongs in the bedroom
because it's too insignificant
a piece for in here.
The shade is just wrong
against all these slick surfaces.
- (Michael) l'll put it back.
- No. I want to try it in a different spot.
I can fix something for you,
something more inexpensive.
I've seen some nice pewters.
um, maybe gunmetal.
And l can make the shade
in a smoother fabric, if you prefer.
But we should stick with
my beiges and my earth tones.
- "Beiges and..."
- Stop picking on her.
- Nobody's picking on her.
- She's a sick woman.
- (Joey) That's great.
- Yes, it's nice.
So how do you feel?
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired, that's all.
- Coffee.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, l tell you, so many jobs.
It's just exhausting.
Yeah, l know. I can't get over how
you sort of jump right in and do it.
Well, l like it. I like to be busy.
And l think l can say that my comeback is
over the shaky period. Wouldn't you say?
I think so. I think your work is better,
in fact, than it's ever been.
- Do you?
- Yeah.
Well, l have to admit that l have received
some rather special compliments lately.
- Oh, yeah?
- uh-huh.
Yes. Well, my spirits are high.
I'm feeling good about myself.
Not to say that l don't run
into an occasional setback,
but l haven't really felt
so confident in a long time.
You look better than you have in ages.
Oh. Have you talked to Dad lately?
No. He's still in Greece.
When he comes back, l hope you'll
corroborate the state of my wellbeing.
Of course.
I've pulled myself together in a way
that he never thought possible.
- I mean, you're really impressive.
- Oh...
Well, maybe a reconciliation
could finally be discussed.
Think so?
Well, it hasn't been that much time.
I really don't... I don't know.
- Why are you always so negative?
- I don't think that was negative.
Oh, you're always reluctant to
encourage me. I don't know why.
Mother, l know that you're optimistic, but
it's important for you to be realistic, too.
- Is there something you're not saying?
- No.
Dr Lobel doesn't think it's unrealistic
to hope that your father and l
might reconcile. It's just a goal.
Fine. I didn't say anything
to get in the way of that.
You always make it sound
as though it's impossible.
- I didn't say it was impossible.
- Yes, you did. You imply that a lot.
Renata thinks it's going to happen.
- I'm sure she didn't say that.
- She did. She implied that.
- Maybe you read into it.
- No. She just looks on the bright side.
Oh, great. That's wonderful. I just don't
think you should delude yourself either.
So there's no chance your father
will want to live with me?
- I didn't say that.
- Renata thinks there's a good chance.
- Just wait and see.
- You just refuse to encourage me.
- Why don't you discuss it with Renata?
- I will, thank you. I will.
Mother paced all the time.
She...
um...
She was an insomniac.
You could, um... always hear her upstairs
pacing in the middle of the night.
But that was more when she...
got back from the hospital.
I, uh...
I saw her...
the first day that they
brought her back. um...
She'd had all this...
electric shock therapy
and... her hair looked grey.
And l couldn't believe it.
It was... It was like...
she was a stranger.
After that, she was always sort of, um...
coming in and... going out.
I guess you...
you never knew.
Before her breakdown, she was very
successful. She was very demanding.
She, uh...
she put Dad through law school and
financed the start ofhis practice.
So in a sense, it was
like he was her creation.
We kept getting shuffled
around to aunts and cousins.
And l guess Joey had the worst of it, cos...
As a kid, Joey was very high-strung.
She was a bright kid, you know? She...
She was very sensitive.
We'd spend some time with Dad,
mostly long Sunday breakfasts.
I always resented his relationship to her.
I always felt that he favoured Joey.
It just seemed that they were
very close and that l was left out.
I like Frederick.
He has dignity... and promise as a writer.
My own strength is visual.
Your images are visual, Renata.
And in all candour,
I much prefer Frederick to Mike.
Mike's fine, Mother.
Well, he uses a very strong aftershave.
- It permeates the house.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
Do you think that if l bought him
another kind of cologne he would switch?
- Can we talk about something else?
- Well, let me give him some.
Then we won't have to talk
about it. It'll just be my gift.
Could we please talk
about something else?
(Arthur) Look, l wanna say something.
I'm gonna be very direct.
I think the occasion calls for it.
I've done a lot of
thinking about this matter
and a great deal of soul-searching.
Now that the girls are all on their own,
l feel that for my own self
I must come to this decision,
though l don't take it lightly.
I feel l've been a dedicated
husband and a responsible father,
and l haven't regretted anything
l've been called upon to do.
Now l feel l want to be
by myself for a while.
And consequently, l've
decided to move out of the house.
I don't know how l'll feel about it when
l finally do it, and it's not irrevocable,
but l feel it's something l have to try.
Now, as l say, it's not
an irrevocable situation.
It's a separation.
It may be for the best. It may not.
But l wanted to lay it on
the table so that everything is open
and as direct as possible.
Will you please not breathe so hard?
- I'll move out.
- What does that mean?
- I don't want to live in this house.
- Eve, think about it.
- I'll move out!
- Look, it's not irrevocable.
It's a trial separation.
I can't be alone.
- Eve...
- I don't wanna discuss the details now.
It's a very bad time for me.
My impotence set in a year ago.
My paralysis.
I suddenly found
l couldn't write any more.
Rather, l shouldn't say suddenly.
Actually, it started happening last winter.
Increasing thoughts about death
just seemed to come over me.
um, these, uh...
A preoccupation with my own mortality.
These... feelings of futility
in relation to my work.
I mean, just what am l
striving to create anyway?
I mean, to what end?
For what purpose, what goal?
I mean...
Do l really care if a handful of my
poems are read after l'm gone?
Is that supposed to be
some sort of compensation?
I used to think it was,
but...
now, for some reason...
I can't... I can't seem to...
I can't seem to shake
the real implication of dying.
It's terrifying.
The intimacy of it embarrasses me.
What's the matter? You still
thinking about your mother?
I can't believe Renata encourages her.
She fills her full of false hope.
She's just trying to keep her spirits up.
I wanna quit my job.
Oh, Joey!
I can't keep my mind on it.
I can't concentrate.
I sit there all day, reading other people's
manuscripts, and l lose interest.
I get headaches. Then l'm meant to write
an opinion. It's not fair to the authors.
A month ago you said you finally
found something you enjoyed.
Well, l was wrong.
I think about going back to acting.
I'm not an actress.
Can't do that again.
Flyn's the actress in this family.
Why don't you work with me?
Because political activity
is not my interest.
I'm too self-centred for that.
That's my whole point.
It would get you off yourself.
Sometimes l think if we had a child...
Oh, God.
I mean, that really makes me anxious.
I mean... it's totally irrevocable.
Whatever happened to your photography?
You used to be so hot on that.
I hate it. It's stupid.
I feel a real need to express something
but l don't know what it is l want
to express or how to express it.
It's always so difficult getting Mother
a birthday present. It's impossible.
Please, let's not stay forever at the party.
I wanna finish proofreading those galleys.
Oh, come on, Frederick.
Really, l hardly ever see Mother.
I hardly ever spend time with her at all.
It won't be so terrible. Flyn will be there.
Terrific. We get caught up on
the latest Hollywood gossip.
Oh, come on, Frederick.
You know Flyn likes you.
And don't behave condescendingly.
I think she senses you talk down to her.
I don't talk down to Flyn. I love
hearing about her hair and her weight
and the latest piece of TV junk she's done.
Well, that's her life.
And anyway, you have to
admit she is a sexy little girl.
No. Flyn is the opposite of sexy.
Hey, what about a scarf?
Flyn suffers from the same thing
my last book suffered from.
She's a perfect example
of form without any content.
That's very profound. And you
haven't even started drinking yet.
I am profound. But l'm not
the award-winning writer.
You're supposed to be giving me
insights into sex and other phenomena.
- Really.
- Really? C'mon, let's go. Frederick.
You look fabulous, Mother. But the
main thing is that you're feeling well.
- Yes, but l tire so easily.
- (Michael) Can l help with something?
(Renata) Joey says you're thinking about
taking on some decorating projects.
Yes. Joey pushes me.
But l'm not going to accept anything
until l'm sure l can maintain
the level that l expect of myself.
(Flyn) Mother, l can't believe this view.
It's just beautiful.
I'm getting used to it.
I miss the sea.
I can't get over how sexy Flyn got.
Yeah. She looks beautiful, doesn't she?
- Your new film is in Arizona?
- No. It's in Denver.
I leave tomorrow. I have to
be ready to shoot on Monday.
I have so many lines to learn.
But it's just a television movie.
- Did you speak to Dad?
- Yeah. I've spoken to him on the phone.
- Did he mention anything?
- He said he visits you.
Just now and then.
Mom?
Nothing to live for any more.
- Don't say that.
- It's true.
You know that's not true.
Mother, look... It's all right, Mom.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. She's fine.
Mom, it's a trial separation.
Of course it is. We've been through
this before. Everything'll work out.
Renata.
- It's her birthday, let her enjoy it.
- I don't think that's exactly the right way.
- Ah!
- (Flyn) You like it?
Oh, now, that's lovely. That's lovely.
- That's pretty.
- It's exactly like yours.
- (Flyn mumbles)
- Very nice. Thanks.
- Lovely.
- (Flyn) l'm so glad.
I hope it fits. I think...
I'm pretty positive it will.
Frederick has finished what l've
already told him is his best work by far.
- That's what you said about the last one.
- But l really feel that this one comes off.
- It's terribly concise...
- You said the same thing. Concise. Spare.
- Well...
- You couldn't think of anything you liked,
so you had to call it something.
Concise. Spare. Pithy. Lean.
OK. Well, you just can't
handle a compliment, that's all.
Guess l can't.
- We gotta go.
- We hardly had any chance to speak.
I know.
So how are you doing?
You seem... You look OK.
I'm good.
I read something of yours in
a magazine. New Yorker, l think.
Poem called "Wondering".
- It was very beautiful.
- It's an old poem.
I redid it. And now when l reread it,
l find it much too ambiguous.
Nah. I may redo it again.
We're starting our drive back.
Can we drop you someplace?
I have to catch a plane
really early tomorrow morning.
Oh, right. I heard you're shooting a movie
in the cold Rocky Mountains of Colorado.
Couldn't be some place like Acapulco.
That's my idea of fantasy.
Lie around on the beach.
Get waited on hand and foot.
Really? l can't take Mexico. I always think
l'll get shot just walking down the street.
- (buzzer)
- What was that?
"Happy birthday. Love, Arthur."
They're beautiful.
I like white roses better than
any other flower on earth.
(Flyn) There you are.
I knew he wouldn't forget.
(Renata) Mom. And you were worried?
They're a good sign. Don't you think?
Well? Are you getting dressed or what?
Frederick, are you talking to me?
We said everything.
Don't blame me. I've been
nothing but understanding.
- You don't help by patronising me.
- I wasn't.
Your work is great.
Who cares what the critics think?
That's easy for you to say. You get
encouragement. You're their little darling.
They're lenient with me,
obviously, because l'm a woman.
No.
- It's because you're so damn good.
- So are you.
The book didn't get
the response it deserved.
I hate to tell you how often
they've missed the boat.
Stop lying to me. I count on
you for honesty, not flattery.
I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
And who cares what anybody thinks?
They think what l think. My work once
showed promise and l haven't delivered.
Your work's not fashionable. You should
be thankful for that, for God's sakes.
What are you after?
The superficial acclaim
of some little book reviewer
in some room somewhere?
We've always talked about fine work
that means something in the long run.
I don't care about fine work!
I don't wanna wait 25 years. I wanna
be able to knock somebody over now!
They're stricter with you because you
attempt more. They refuse to take that...
Stop looking for excuses, all right?
l'm not writing for a time capsule.
And half the stuff that's written,
it's garbage, they praise sky-high.
The baby-sitter will be here in a minute.
- I told you, l'm not going.
- We can't not go. What is the matter?
I'm not in the mood
for your lesbian friends
and a lot of vacuous gossip
about New York poetesses.
Will you stop pitying
yourself so much? l'm going.
Look, why can't you just once in a while
consider my feelings and my needs?
I'm sick of your needs! l'm tired of
your idiosyncrasy and competitiveness.
I have my own problems!
There'll be chitchat
about the nature of poetry,
your symbolism,
your contribution to whatever.
We never see Marion and Gail. I don't
understand. You used to like them.
I can't stand 'em. They're so enthusiastic.
College kids. I get embarrassed.
Oh, well, don't get embarrassed.
Don't come. Drink yourself unconscious.
That's one cliché of being
a novelist you have no problem with.
Yeah, l sure can drink.
You're fine as long as
l keep everything going.
- What?
- Sh.
You mean the cheques from Daddy so
you can write yourself into immortality?
I also raise the family that you
wanted. Or thought you wanted.
Hey, you made some noises
about experiencing motherhood.
I'm sure you thought
it was great raw material.
Well, now you got another human being.
It wasn't my idea, and l'm not
ashamed to be subsidised either.
I turn things out.
Yeah, you do.
You turn things out. You're incredible.
Frederick...
Frederick, you have so much to offer.
I wanna help, not hurt.
I can't go out. I'm not in the mood.
I'm liable to kill somebody.
I'm going. Bye.
You look as good as l've
seen you in a long time.
And in no time at all you've
turned this place into a lovely home.
I saw Joey last week.
I may be working on her apartment.
Mike seems amenable. He isn't
really what l had in mind for Joey.
But l'm getting more used to him.
She has no direction.
I expected such great things from her.
She was an extraordinary child.
- And how are you getting along, Arthur?
- Fine.
I'm fine.
Busy. It's important to keep busy.
Did you like the Matisse drawing?
lt was on sale at Parke-Bernet.
Oh, yes. It's lovely.
So delicate.
Well...
We'll talk, Eve.
(siren)
She's got to go back to the
sanatarium, for a while at least.
Oh, poor Joey. Poor Joey.
She spent so much time with her,
and... I don't know. What's the point?
We can't watch her constantly. There's
no way you can be with her all the time.
How is Joey?
I worry about her.
She seems to be floundering.
I don't know. I guess she
hasn't found herself yet.
Couldn't you help her?
She looks up to you.
I do, Dad, l try. I try to be
supportive. I try to encourage her.
I'm not criticising,
but it just seems to me there's always
been an antagonism between you two.
Well, you know Joey.
She tends to be competitive with me.
Well, you're very successful.
I think you kinda hold that over her.
- Come on, Dad. That's not true.
- No, Renata, l'm not blind.
I see what's going on.
You seclude yourself in Connecticut,
acting the aloof artist,
and no one can get near you.
I don't wanna discuss this right now.
Just avoid the subject.
I'm upset. You're upset.
Joey had such potential.
And now it's come to nothing.
It's so typical. As usual, you're obsessed
with Joey while Mother is lying...
Now, don't blame me for that.
That's nobody's fault.
- How's Frederick?
- Oh, fine.
- He's going to be teaching at Barnard.
- Oh, how nice.
I read something he wrote recently
in Sunday Times Review, l think.
It was very nasty, but very funny.
It's a giraffe - enormous.
Cory would love it.
It's probably way too much money
but l'd like to buy her one.
(Renata) She's so cute. She sits and has
conversations with the television set.
(Eve) She's such a pretty thing.
- How's Mike?
- Fine.
We'd love to see you and Frederick.
Oh, well, that'd be great, but it's
been sort of a rough week for me.
It doesn't have to be this week.
I gotta give Frederick a chance
to get settled in at Barnard.
Renny, why do you
keep pushing me away?
- Well, l don't.
- Yeah, you do.
- It's like you don't want me near you.
- Oh, Joey, come on.
You know l've had work problems.
I need isolation. I need to be alone.
The creative thing, it's very delicate.
That's great. You hide behind your work,
Flyn's never here, and l inherited Mother.
I see Mother too. I phone her.
Yeah. But you're in Connecticut,
and l end up with all the dirty work.
I can't help it if you feel guilty
about your feelings toward Mother.
I mean, you can't seem to
do enough to make up for it.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know. You could never stand her.
I don't believe this. My whole life,
l've only wanted to be her.
Yeah. Well, for a while there,
you were her, weren't you?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, Joey, you know.
All those headaches every time she'd
come home. You never wanted her home.
This is incredible. I mean,
you twist everything l say. I give up.
(writes)
(sighs)
You OK?
I just experienced the strangest sensation.
Well, you look kinda pale.
It was as if l had a sudden...
clear vision where everything seems...
sort of awful and predatory.
It was like... It was like l was here
and the world was out there,
and l couldn't bring us together.
Could you have had one of those dreams?
No.
No, because the same thing happened
last week when l was reading upstairs.
I suddenly became
hyper aware of my body.
And l could feel my heart beating,
and l began to imagine that...
I could feel the blood sort of
coursing through my veins
and my hands and in
the back of my... neck.
I felt precarious, like l was
a machine that was functioning
but l could just conk out at any second.
You're not gonna conk out. You gotta put
those kind of thoughts out of your head.
Yeah. It frightens me,
too, you know, because...
I'm not that far from the age when
Mother began showing signs of strain.
You're not your mother.
You're not. You're not.
You've been under stress and you haven't
been sleeping well. Things like that.
What are these?
Are these Joey's photographs?
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me see.
They're not very good, l'm afraid.
No. She doesn't really have an eye.
She's gonna wanna know what you think,
so you'd better get ready.
Poor Joey.
She has all the anguish and anxiety
of the artistic personality
without any of the talent.
And naturally, l'm put in the position
of having to encourage her.
Tell her the truth.
Get it over with. Don't lead her on.
I don't lead her on. I mean,
God, l can't break her heart.
And you know how
competitive she is with me.
I always think it's better
to level with a person.
- Wish you'd done that with me more.
- I did.
No, you didn't.
You flattered me, and l liked it.
Frederick, you're good,
and l've never hesitated to say it.
There's something missing from my work.
I don't know. I don't know if l've lost it
or l never had it, or what.
You're capable of being extraordinary
and you've stopped for spite.
No, not for spite!
I'll get back to it someday.
You throw everything away to spite me.
Let's not talk about it. OK?
Fine.
What are you gonna say to Joey?
She should marry Michael and stop her
worrying about being so damn creative.
Sometimes she just annoys me.
(religious programme on television)
(man) Jimmy's getting excited.
It's an exciting thing to be a Christian,
and l have a gentleman
who's a friend ofmine,
a fairly new friend, but our friendship
goes way back to the cross ofCalvary.
Roy Schwartz, it's a delight
to have you here today.
Now, Roy, you are by
birth what nationality?
- A Hebrew.
- A Hebrew.
When l was talking about
God's chosen people -
you're probably aware, you've studied
your history, you're involved in this -
what part did the Jewish people
and the nation oflsrael
have in God's timepiece today?
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.
It's 45 minutes.
The traffic was unbearable. I'm sorry.
- You should take that into account.
- Could we drop this? My head is splitting.
- What's the matter?
- What do you think? l'm pregnant.
- Thought you might be.
- I'm goddamned annoyed!
- We'll take care of it.
- Naturally, we'll take care of it.
Joey, l said we'll take care of it.
It's nothing.
I'm so stupid! How can l be so careless?
All right, it happens. We could have the
kid. It wouldn't be the end of the world.
- For me it would be.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
Oh, Michael. I've thought about it.
It's absurd. How could we have a kid?
l don't even know where my life is going.
- Maybe it's not such a great idea.
- You don't think so either?
I guess not.
- Well, what happened to you?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.
- We found something for the bedroom.
- This won't be too expensive, l hope.
- It's a little more...
- We had this...
Can we not get into a financial dispute?
It's right over here. I think you'll like it.
- Your father's back from Greece.
- Is he?
You know he's back. You're having
dinner with him tomorrow at Renata's.
Renata told me. Were you not going to?
- Yes. I just know how you are on that.
- Will you talk to him? He listens to you.
He's a grown man.
He makes his own decisions.
But he puts great store
by what you have to say.
If he wants to move back in with you,
he will. If he doesn't, he won't.
- Why are you so reluctant to help me?
- Reluctant? l do nothing but cater to you.
It's as though you don't
care if we're together.
Why wouldn't l want you to be happy?
But you shouldn't delude yourself.
Will you tell him how well l've been
doing? That my work is flourishing again?
- That my mood swings are less rapid?
- He doesn't care.
He just wants to know that
l'm on an even keel, that's all.
- Leave me alone.
- Joey...
- Just leave me out of this!
- Where are you going?
Maybe it wouldn't be
so bad to have a child.
- Oh, please.
- Sometimes just taking...
- I can't. OK?
- You mean you won't.
Why do you stay with me? l don't
understand. I give you nothing but grief.
You should take the job at the advertising
agency, and we should maybe get settled.
Yeah, right! lf l start writing copy
and having kids, l'd never get out of it.
I'd be swallowed up in
some anonymous lifestyle.
I wanna do something with my life.
- Now l'm guilty cos l left my mother.
- She'll be fine.
- Oh, a lot you care.
- It's your mother that can't stand me.
- (Mike) Well...
- I hope the cat isn't in the kitchen.
Cory's gonna go upstairs
and play for a while.
I'll see you later, all right? Bye-bye.
(Frederick) l could get 'em out in a month.
Then you wouldn't have
anything left to say. Right?
- (buzzer)
- Dad.
He was so excited when l spoke to him.
He saw that terrible movie
that Flyn was in on the plane.
- (Frederick) Come in.
- (Arthur) Good to see you.
The traffic in this town
is getting impossible.
Hi.
Mike.
- Hi, Joey.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Renata.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi. This is Pearl.
- (Mike) Hello.
- Hi.
- I'm Mike. This is Joey.
- Glad to meet you. Hi.
- (Renata) Hello.
- Frederick.
- Hi.
um, would you like anything to drink?
Whatever Arthur's having's fine.
Why don't you sit there? lt's the
only comfortable place in the house.
It's good to be back.
I'm sure you must have enjoyed Athens.
You can't beat Greece
for sand and blue water.
And the food! l could eat lamb six
times a day. And that's with an ouzo.
The only problem l had
was nobody spoke English.
Everybody understood
what was important.
Did you get a chance to see
any of the temples, architecture?
Oh, yes. It's so wonderful.
You're steeped in history.
We saw some great examples
from the fifth century BC.
Remember that temple?
Beautifully preserved.
- Tell you the truth, l prefer the beaches.
- She could sit in the sun all day.
That's enough ruins.
How many ruins can you see?
But that hot sand,
blue water - that's for me.
Maybe we should continue this
conversation in the other room.
First time l went to Europe,
with my first husband, years ago,
all we saw was churches.
One cathedral led to another.
They were beautiful but... you see two or
three, then enough already. All the day...
- You knew he was bringing someone?
- Yes. Didn't l mention it?
Give me a good sirloin anytime.
Charcoal. They talk about
club steaks and porterhouse?
Sirloin, charcoal and blood rare.
Pearl's husband was something of a chef.
He was an amateur chef.
He was in the jewellery business,
my first husband, may he rest in peace.
- Adam, my second, was an orthodontist.
- How many have you had?
Two. Adam had a massive coronary.
Rudy was an alcoholic.
- More gravy?
- No, no, no. It's too heavy.
Ah, what are you worried about?
lt's delicious. Try it.
- Where are you from, Pearl?
- Florida.
Oh, we lived all over the place when l
was younger, but l prefer a warm climate.
I even lived in Australia for a year.
With my sister Fay, when Adam died.
I went nuts. It's dead there.
I was in Sydney, Australia, once.
Oh. Was l lying? Did you like it?
It was just a vacation.
I was only there a couple of days.
Lucky. It's like a morgue. Nothing to do
at night, no pizzazz. I couldn't take that.
Here's a woman who could
go dancing every night.
You know what l say: you only live once,
but once is enough if you play it right.
- Do you have any children, Pearl?
- Oh, yes. I have two sons.
Lewis and John.
Lewis is in real estate.
John runs an art gallery.
(Renata) Oh?
In the lobby in Caesars Palace
in Las Vegas.
It's not exactly a gallery,
it's more a concession.
- Paintings of clowns on black velvet?
- That's right, junk.
Oh, it's pure junk, but people like it. They
get a kick out of it. He does very nicely.
- Pearl collects African art.
- Oh. Oh, l love black ebony.
I own some statues.
Actually, they're from Trinidad.
Oh, l love those real primitive statues
with the big hips and the big breasts.
Oh, l even have some voodoo
masks. I believe in that stuff.
I could tell your fortune,
but l need cards. Later, maybe.
This couple we met were raving about it,
so l cabled from the office to get tickets.
I'm glad l did. It was fabulous.
(Renata) We thought it was interesting.
But depressing as hell. It was
pessimistic to the point of futility.
Fashionable pessimism
is all the rage nowadays.
When they sentenced those Algerians
to death, l thought it was a good ending.
(Renata) You call that fashionable,
but it's hard to argue
that in the face of death,
life loses real meaning.
- It is?
- Well, l can't argue it succinctly,
but if you've read Socrates or Buddha,
Schopenhauer, even Ecclestiastes,
they're very convincing.
Well, they should know.
I don't read that much.
What struck me was the way the
terrorists only killed if they had to.
Never wantonly, just if they
had to, to achieve their aims.
I was very moved when that Algerian boy
said he killed in the name of freedom.
- It gave me chills.
- (Renata) lt's killing for an abstraction.
Why? You value the life of a single person
over the lives of thousands of others?
I don't know. I mean, who are those
thousands? lt's another abstraction.
To me, the conflict over
the giving of the information
between the French doctor and the
Algerian was the best part of the play.
I know. The writer argued both sides so
brilliantly you didn't know who was right.
I didn't get that. I mean,
to me, it wasn't such a big deal.
One guy was a squealer.
I liked the guy that wasn't.
It's a little more complex
than that, don't you think?
Why? You liked the squealer?
Did l miss something?
That's what made me
anxious about the play. I mean,
how do you figure out
the right thing to do?
How do you know?
How do you know? l don't know.
You just know, you feel it. I mean...
You just don't squeal. I don't know.
Anyway, it was a good evening
in the theatre for a change.
I'd love another piece of cheesecake but...
Well, have it. What are
you worried about?
You'll live to be 100 if you give up
all the things that make you want to.
Am l the only one or is it hot in here?
Can we open a window?
OK. Ready?
- uh-huh.
- OK. Pick a card.
- Any one.
- There you go.
OK. Put it back. Any place, any place.
All right. OK. Watch.
- I'm ready.
- All right.
Now we shuffle.
Now you... All right.
- What?
- No, nothing. Just go ahead.
- Is it that?
- No.
- That?
- No.
- That?
- Wrong.
- It's none of those three.
- None of those.
OK. Not that one.
- Not that one.
- No.
- That one.
- Jesus, that's fantastic.
- How did you do that?
- Oh, what's the difference?
That is a miraculous card trick.
And l was watching really closely.
Where did you learn that?
I'm a gal that's been around. I've
picked up a lot of useless information.
You tell fortunes. You do card
tricks. You do séances, too?
Nuh-uh. Not me. I figure whatever's
out there, it's their business.
Besides, you think l wanna
bring back my ex-husband?
As soon as possible,
Pearl and l are gonna get married.
Oh, God.
- That's gonna sink Mother.
- She'll get over it.
- Easy for you to say.
- It's not easy.
- How long have you known her, Dad?
- Now, a month.
A month? lsn't that a little hasty?
- We've spent a lot of time together.
- That's a lot of time?
I expect you all at the wedding.
Flyn, too. I insist that
Flyn fly in and meet Pearl.
- The whole thing does seem a bit fast.
- It's gonna be fine.
She's a nice woman.
She's kind. She's affectionate.
Christ, l'm 63 years old, l wanna relax.
I'm happy just to lie
on the beach with her.
I like it that she's full of energy
and demonstrative and open.
You just met her. She's a widow,
and you're a wealthy man.
- So she's after my money?
- She's not saying...
- Why? ls that so far-fetched?
- I won't dignify that.
Don't get upset. A man in
your position has to be careful.
You don't know her yet.
She's a fine woman, and l love her.
It's going to be the worst possible
thing that could happen to Mother.
I can't believe she imagines
we'll get back together.
She imagines it because
everyone except me leads her on.
- I don't wanna hear that story.
- It's true.
And all that talk about a trial separation?
You were never coming back.
I wanted to let her down easily.
She's such a fragile thing.
She is not a thing. We all treat her like
a hospital patient. She's a human being.
Your idea of treating her like a human
being is to throw cold water on her hopes.
What hopes?
It was bound to happen. The most that
we could do was postpone it a little bit.
- You're all she lives for.
- Don't give me that...
- Now you're abandoning her for this...
- Joey, don't you go any further.
Dad, don't get upset. Don't get all riled up.
And don't think l don't notice you looking
at her in a judgmental, superior way.
You're imagining things.
We knew about your affairs before, but
your choices were a little more discreet!
Joey, shut up! Dad, she's upset.
Joey, you know how much
your opinion means to me.
- She's a vulgarian.
- Joey, be quiet!
I don't wanna discuss this.
I think you should do as you feel,
with our blessing.
- Joey, l count on you.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.
Will you tell him it's OK?
Obviously it's your approval he needs.
- He had no trouble getting yours.
- It doesn't mean as much as yours.
I want the support of all my daughters!
I'm not just here to make
sacrifices and foot the bills.
It's time you thought of me!
(sighs)
(Eve) l'm sorry to hurry lunch,
but l wanted you to see this before
the place gets cluttered up with people.
When you wrote from Greece
you were telling me about
the mosaics in the Orthodox churches.
But look at this, all these mosaics.
There, behind the altar.
And in a Romanesque church.
Isn't that amazing?
And look at that. And here
in New York. It's really incredible.
(Arthur) Quite surprising.
It makes me homesick for our trips.
All those churches, you must have
seen a lot when you were there.
- Yes.
- Be so marvellous to forget everything
and take a nice slow trip to the Far East.
It might get us back on the right track.
Eve, l said l had something
l wanted to say to you.
What?
I think we should finalise our divorce.
You do?
Yeah. Sooner or later
we've got to face reality
and try to make new lives for ourselves.
It's very funny, because l thought
that's what might be on your mind.
- It's not the end of the world.
- It's not?
I think it's goddamn terrible!
Eve, everything's going to be just fine.
Oh, l know that it's a little... soon
perhaps to talk about a reconciliation,
but l don't see why we
have to finalise our divorce.
I don't see why we can't
just go on the way we are.
- We should be free to make other plans.
- Like what?
Well, in the event that we meet
other people, become involved.
- You wanna remarry? ls that it?
- I'm not discussing that.
- Have you met someone?
- No.
Oh, you're lying. Of course you've met
someone. Why don't you be honest?
- Yes, l have. But if you're gonna make...
- I don't wanna hear any more.
I talked with your doctor.
- You talked to Dr Lobel behind my back?
- Not behind your back. Discreetly.
You've discussed this with Dr Lobel
behind my back. It's so humiliating.
Eve, it's your doctor and myself.
Now, how private can one be?
And he assured you that l can handle it.
Is that right? How humiliating!
You're not humiliated.
Oh, l just wanna die.
Now stop that.
I just hate my life!
(shouting and arguing)
Oh, l can't... I can't breathe!
(Renata) Flyn!
Hi.
Oh. Ahh. Oh, God, it's good to see you.
- (Renata) No, it's good to see you.
- You look terrific.
You really do. That's a great sweater.
- Oh, no.
- It really is.
- You've seen this sweater before.
- No, l haven't. It's terrific.
Are you tanned, Renny?
You been somewhere?
Why? Do l have on too much make-up?
- (Joey) You're the one that looks great.
- I don't. I'm heavy.
No. I've gained weight.
My plane flight was so bumpy,
l thought l was gonna die.
I made such a fool of myself with
the man next to me. Really did.
- Have you met Pearl?
- Yes. She's not what l expected.
No. God. God, isn't it strange
being back in the house again?
- Yeah.
- Have you spoken with Mother?
Oh, yes. We're gonna have
dinner one night this week.
- (Flyn) How's she holding up?
- Better than we expected. Right, Joey?
She took it very badly at first.
But after the initial shock,
she seemed to come out of it.
Joey feels that all of her
Jesus Christ nonsense is a help.
- (Flyn) Whatever works.
- (Michael) Hello, Flyn.
- Michael. Gosh, hi.
- Nice to see you.
It's good to see you, too. Joey, you
have to tell me what you're up to.
Yet another job. In an ad agency.
- (Flyn) That's fabulous.
- No. But it's temporary.
Here we are. I made some
cocktail franks and meatballs.
About time. I'm starved.
We have everything
your little heart desires.
Good.
Are you and Dad staying here
or are you gonna take a place in town?
Well, it's a little quiet out
here, but Arthur loves it.
It means redoing so much of the house.
In what way?
Oh, l don't know. There's just
the two of us and it's kinda pale.
Besides, l have so much furniture and
pictures, this place'd be like a warehouse.
Would you like to hear some music?
(Renata) Do l look older?
(Flyn) Older?
Yeah, l mean it. Do you think l look older?
No. Why would you think that?
I don't know. I don't know, l...
I look in the mirror and l feel discouraged.
Now l see you and you don't change at all.
No, you don't change. Your skin,
it's like cream. Look at your skin.
I work at it.
No, l don't think that's it.
I have a few good years, then my youth
will be frozen on celluloid for TV movies.
Come on, Flyn. You're more than just
beautiful. You know you have talent.
- Don't pump me up.
- Why do you say that?
I know what l am.
Look, l'm not treated seriously.
When really classy projects
come along l get passed over.
If it wasn't for the stupid
television industry...
You have always been so
self-deprecating. You know that.
No.
No, you're the gifted one in this
family, Renny. I'm proud of you.
(Renata) l wish you lived here,
l really do. Every time l see you, l...
It just reminds me
how much l do miss you.
How's Frederick?
He's angry. He's teaching when
he really wants to be writing.
Teaching can't be taught anyway. He's
taking his rage out in these critical pieces
under the guise of high standards.
I don't know. I guess l...
- I don't think l've been very good for him.
- Oh, Renny, he idolises you.
- (Flyn) We ought to get back.
- No, l think l'm gonna stay a while longer.
OK. I'll see you back there.
Hi.
You know l want you to be happy.
I want you both to be happy.
Tell her.
Tell Pearl.
I know she puts on a gay facade,
but... she knows how you feel.
Tell her.
Will you?
OK.
You look deep in thought.
(chuckles) l'm deep in vodka.
Would you help me get my boots off?
That's the best offer l had all year.
I paid 200 bucks for these boots
and they kill my feet.
I did a terrible thing last week.
I wrote about this friend's book.
Not a very good book.
I pointed that out. Which is
what l was getting paid to do.
But l was extremely cruel about it.
And l took great pleasure in my cruelty.
My anger scares me.
I don't like what l'm becoming.
I happen to think you're
a very impressive person.
Oh. I think you have
very impressive feet.
And l happen to think
you're very drunk.
Come on, not yet.
Yes. Thank you.
(Judge) We are gathered together
here in the presence of this company
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of matrimony.
Arthur, will you have this
woman as your wedded wife,
to live together in the ordinances
and estate of matrimony?
Will you love her, comfort her,
honour and keep her
in sickness and in health,
and, forsaking all others, keep you only
unto her so long as you both do live?
(Arthur) l will.
Pearl, will you have this man
as your wedded husband,
to live together in the ordinances
and estate of matrimony?
Will you love him, comfort him,
honour and keep him
in sickness and in health,
and, forsaking all others, keep you only
unto him so long as you both do live?
(Pearl) l will.
In as much as Arthur and Pearl
have consented together in wedlock,
and have witnessed the
same before this company,
and thereto have pledged
each to the other,
and have declared the same
by joining of hands,
I, in accordance with
the authority invested in me
by the law of the State of New York,
do announce that they
are husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
(Judge) Well, Arthur, friends...
(Renata) Congratulations.
(# "Keepin' Out ofMischiefNow"
by Tommy Dorsey)
Jesus. I don't think l've ever
seen him dance before in his life.
Ow.
OK. Don't forget.
- Let me get you some champagne.
- That would be perfect.
Come on, baby.
Oh, my!
(music ends)
(# "Wolverine Blues" by
The World's Greatest Jazz Band)
Jesus Christ, be careful!
- You've had too much to drink.
- Just cos l don't act like an animal!
- That's enough!
- Oh, please! Just leave me alone!
(door opens)
(Frederick chuckles)
What?
Oh, Frederick, you're drunk.
C'mon. You're always flirting with me.
No.
Yes. You flirt. You like to be looked at.
Otherwise you don't exist,
except in somebody else's eyes.
Stop it, Frederick. You're drunk.
No, l'm celebrating. You got
a new mother. She's a hot number.
Can't you feel the heat?
No.
It's been such a long time since l made
love to a woman l didn't feel inferior to.
Or am l being tactless?
Mother?
Is that you?
You shouldn't be here.
Not tonight.
I'll take you home.
You look so strange and tired.
I feel like we're in a dream together.
Please don't look so sad.
It makes me feel so guilty.
I'm so consumed with guilt.
It's ironic...
because, uh... I've cared for you so...
And you have nothing but
disdain for me, and yet l feel guilty.
I think you're... really too perfect
to live in this world.
I mean, all the...
beautifully furnished rooms,
carefully-designed interiors,
everything's so controlled.
There wasn't any room
for any real feelings.
None.
Between any of us.
Except Renata,
who never gave you the time of day.
You worship Renata.
You worship talent.
Well, what happens to
those of us who can't create?
What do we do? What do l do, when l'm
overwhelmed with feelings about life?
How do l get them out?
I feel such rage toward you!
Oh, Mother.
Don't you see?
You're... not just a sick woman.
That would be too easy.
The truth is...
there's been perverseness
and wilfulness of attitude
in many of the things you've done.
At the centre of a sick psyche
there is a sick spirit.
But l love you.
And we have no other choice
but to forgive each other.
- Are you talking to someone?
- Yes, uh...
I thought l heard voices.
- Mother?
- Yes?
What?
You said "mother" and l said "yes".
Mother?
Mother!
Mother!
(Joey gags)
(sighs)
(Joey) After the funeral service,
we all returned to the beach house.
I couldn't help experiencing
some very nostalgic memories.
Naturally, ofmy mother...
and, pleasantly, ofthe few
warmer moments we'd known.
I recalled how beautiful she was, dressing
to go out for the evening with my father.
And ofhow Renata looked up
to her, and her ideas about art.
And how Flyn was so
impressed as a tiny girl
when Mother decorated
a Christmas tree.
I felt compelled to write
these thoughts down.
They seemed very powerful to me.
Water's so calm.
Yes.
It's very peaceful.
