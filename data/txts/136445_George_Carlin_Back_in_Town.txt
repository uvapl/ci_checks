Hey let me ask
you something.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why is it that
most of the people
who are against abortion
are people you wouldn't
want to fuck in the
first place huh?
Huh?
Boy these conservatives
are really something
aren't they?
They're all in
favor of the unborn.
They will do anything
for the unborn
but once you're born
you're on your own.
Pro-life conservatives
are obsessed
with the fetus from
conception to nine months.
After that they don't
want to know about you.
They don't want
to hear from you.
No nothing.
No neonatal care, no
daycare, no head start,
no school lunch, no
food stamps, no welfare,
no nothing.
If you're preborn
you're fine.
If you're preschool
you're fucked.
You're fucked.
Conservatives don't
give a shit about you
until you reach
military age.
Then they think
you are just fine.
Just what they
been looking for.
Conservatives
want live babies
so they can raise them
to be dead soldiers.
Pro-life.
Pro-life.
These people
aren't pro-life
they're killing doctors.
What kind of
pro-life is that?
What they'll do anything
they can to save a fetus
but if it grows
up to be a doctor
they just might
have to kill it?
They're not pro-life.
You know what they are?
They're anti-woman.
Simple as it gets.
Anti-woman. They
don't like them.
They don't like women.
They believe a woman's
primary role is to
function as a broodmare
for the state.
Pro-life.
You don't see
many of these
white anti-abortion women
volunteering to have
any black fetuses
transplanted into
their uteruses do you?
No you don't see
them adopting
a whole lot of crack
babies do you?
No that might be
something Christ would do.
And you won't see...
you won't see
a lot of these
pro-life people dousing
themselves in kerosene
and lighting
themselves on fire.
You know morally committed
religious people
in South Vietnam
knew how to stage
a Goddamn demonstration
didn't they?
Huh?
Hey.
They knew how to put
on a fucking protest.
Light yourself on fire!
Come on you
moral crusaders
let's see a little smoke
to match that fire
in your belly.
Here's another
question I have.
How come when it's
us it's an abortion
and when it's a chicken
it's an omelet?
What?
Are we so much better than
chickens all of a sudden?
When did this happen
that we pass chickens
in goodness?
Name six ways we're
better than chickens.
See nobody can do it.
You know why?
Cause chickens
are decent people.
You don't see chickens
hanging around in
drug gangs do you?
You don't see a chicken
strapping some
guy to a chair
and hooking up his nuts
to a car battery do you?
When's the last chicken
you heard about
came home from work
and beat the shit
out of his hen?
Doesn't happen
cause chickens are
decent people.
Well let's get back
to this abortion shit.
Now is a fetus
a human being?
This seems to be the
central question.
Well if a fetus
is a human being
how come the census
doesn't count them?
If a fetus is
a human being
how come when there's
a miscarriage
they don't have a funeral.
If a fetus is
a human being
how come people say
we have two children
and one on the way
instead of saying we
have three children?
People say life
begins at conception,
I say life began about
a billion years ago
and it's a
continuous process.
Continuous, just
keeps rolling along.
Rolling.
Rolling.
Rolling along.
I said you know something?
Listen, you can go
back further than that.
What about the
carbon atoms?
Huh?
Human life could not
exist without carbon
so is it just
possible that maybe
we shouldn't be
burning all this coal?
Just looking for a
little consistency here
in these anti-abortion
arguments.
See the really hardcore
people will tell you
life begins at
fertilization.
Fertilization when the
sperm fertilizes the egg,
which is usually a
few moments after
the man says,
"Gee honey I was
going to pull out
but the phone rang
and it startled me."
Fertilization.
But even after the egg
is fertilized it's still
six or seven days before
it reaches the uterus
and pregnancy begins
and not every egg
makes it that far.
80% of a woman's
fertilized eggs are
rinsed and flushed out
of her body once a month
during those delightful
few days she has.
They wind up on
sanitary napkins
and yet they are
fertilized eggs.
So basically what these
anti-abortion people
are telling us is that
any woman who's had
more than one period
is a serial killer.
Consistency.
Consistency.
Hey, hey if they really
want to get serious
what about all the
sperm that are wasted
when the state executes
a condemned man
and one of these
pro-life guys
who's watching comes
in his pants huh?
Here's a guy
standing over there
with his jockey
shorts full
of little Vinnie's
and Debbie's
and nobody's saying
a word to the guy.
Not every ejaculation
deserves a name.
Now
speaking of consistency
Catholics, which I was
until I reached
the age of reason,
Catholics
Catholics and
other Christians
are against abortions
and they're against
homosexuals.
Well who has less
abortions than
homosexuals?
Leave these fucking
people alone
for Crist sakes.
Here is an entire
class of people
guaranteed never to
have an abortion
and the Catholics
and Christians
are just tossing
them aside.
You'd think they'd
make natural allies.
Go look for consistency
in religion.
And speaking of my
friends, the Catholics,
when John Cardinal
O'Connor of New York
and some of these other
cardinals and bishops
have experienced their
first pregnancies
and their first
labor pains
and they've raised a
couple of children
on a minimum wage
then I'll be glad to hear
what they have to
say about abortion.
I'm sure it will
be interesting
and enlightening too
but
but
in the meantime what
they ought to be doing
is telling these priests
who took a vow of chastity
to keep their hands
off the altar boys.
Keep your hands to
yourself Father
you know?
When Jesus said,
"Suffer the little
children come onto me,"
that's not what he
was talking about.
So you know what I tell
these anti-abortion
people?
I say, Hey,
hey if you think a fetus
is more important
than a woman
try getting a fetus to
wash the shit stains
out of your underwear.
For no pay and no pension.
I tell them to think
of an abortion
as term limits,
that's all it is.
Biological term limits.
But you know the
longer you listen
to this abortion debate
the more you here this
phrase sanctity of life.
You've heard that,
sanctity of life.
You believe in it?
Personally I think
it's a bunch of shit.
Well I mean
life is sacred?
Who said so?
God?
Hey if you read
history you realize
that God is one of the
leading causes of death.
Has been for
thousands of years.
Hindus, Muslims,
Jews, Christians
all taking turns
killing each other
cause God told them
it was a good idea.
The sword of God, the
blood of the Lamb,
vengeance is my millions
of dead motherfuckers.
Millions of dead
motherfuckers
all because they gave
the wrong answer
to the God question.
You believe in God?
No.
Dead.
You believe in God?
Yes.
You believe in my God?
No.
Dead.
My God has a bigger
dick than your God.
Thousands of years...
Thousands of years and
all the best wars too.
The bloodiest most
brutal wars fought
all based on
religious hatred,
which is fine with me.
Hey anytime a bunch
of holy people
want to kill each
other I'm a happy guy.
But don't be giving
me all this shit
about the
sanctity of life.
I mean even if there
were such a thing
I don't think it's
something you can
blame on God.
No you know what
the sanctity of
life came from?
We made it up.
You know why?
Cause were alive.
Self-interest.
Living people have
a strong interest in
promoting the idea of
somehow life is sacred.
You don't see Abbott and
Costello running around
talking about
this shit do you?
Were not hearing
a whole lot
from Mussolini
on the subject.
What's the
latest from JFK?
Not a Goddamn thing
cause JFK, Mussolini
and Abbott and Costello
are fucking dead.
They're fucking dead.
And dead people give
less than a shit
about the
sanctity of life.
Only living people
care about it
so the whole
thing grows out of
a completely biased
point of view.
It's a self-serving,
man-made bullshit story.
It's one of these things
we tell ourselves
so we'll feel noble.
Life is sacred.
Makes you feel noble.
But let me ask you this.
If everything that
ever lived is dead
and everything alive
is going to die
where does the
sacred part come in?
I'm having
trouble with that.
Cause I mean even with
this stuff we preach
about the sanctity of
life we don't practice it.
We don't practice it.
Look at what we kill.
Mosquitoes and flies
cause their pests.
Lions and tigers
cause it's fun.
Chickens and pigs
cause we're hungry.
Pheasants and quails
cause it's fun
and we're hungry.
And people.
We kill people
cause their pests
and it's fun.
And you might have
noticed something else.
The sanctity of
life doesn't seem
to apply to cancer
cells does it?
You rarely see a bumper
sticker that says,
Save the tumors
or I break for
advanced melanoma.
Nah viruses, mold,
mildew, maggots, fungus,
weeds, ecoli
bacteria, the crabs,
nothing sacred
about those things.
So at best the
sanctity of life
is kind of a
selective thing.
We get to choose
which forms of life
we feel are sacred
and we get to
kill the rest.
Pretty neat deal huh?
You know how we got it?
We made the whole
fucking thing up.
Made it up.
The same way
Thank you.
The same way we made
up the death penalty.
We made them both up.
Sanctity of life and
the death penalty
aren't we versatile?
And you know in
this country
now there are a
lot of people
who want to expand
the death penalty
to include drug dealers.
This is really stupid.
Drug dealers aren't
afraid to die.
They're already killing
each other every day
on the streets
by the hundreds.
Drive-bys,
gang shootings,
they're not afraid to die.
Death penalty doesn't
mean anything
unless you use
it on people
who are afraid to die
like the bankers who
launder the drug money.
The bankers
who launder
the drug money.
Forget the dealers.
You want to slow down
that drug traffic
you got to start executing
a few of these
fucking bankers.
White middle class
Republican bankers.
And I'm not talking
I'm not talking about
soft American executions
like lethal injection.
I'm talking about fucking
crucifixion folks.
Let's bring back
crucifixion,
a form of capital
punishment
that Christians and
Jews of America
can really appreciate.
And I'd go a
little further.
I'd crucify people
upside down.
Like Saint Peter,
feet up head down.
And naked.
I'd have naked, upside
down crucifixions
on TV once a week
at half time
on the monday night
football game.
Monday night.
The monday night
crucifixions.
You'd have
people tuning in
don't even care
about football.
Wouldn't you
like to hear
Dan Deardorf explain
why the nails have to go
in at a certain angle?
And I'll guarantee
you one thing
you start executing,
you start nailing one
white banker per week
to a big wooden
cross on national TV
you're going to see
that drug traffic
begin to slow down
pretty fucking quick.
Pretty fucking quick.
You won't even be
able to buy drugs
in schools and
prisons anymore.
Now I don't care about
capital punishment
one way or another
cause I know it
doesn't do anything.
It doesn't do anything
except maybe satisfy
a kind of a biblical
need for revenge.
You know if you read
the bible you see that
it's full of
retribution and revenge
so really capital
punishment
is kind of a
religious ritual.
It's a purification rite.
It's a modern sacrament
and as long as that's true
I say let's liven
it up a little.
I honestly believe if you
make the death penalty
a little more
entertaining
and learn to market
it correctly
you just might be able
to raise enough money
to balance the stupid
fucking budget.
Balance the stupid
fucking budget.
And don't forget
the polls show
the American people
want capital punishment
and they want a
balanced budget
and I think even in
a fake democracy
people ought to
get what they want
once in a while
just to feed
this illusion
that there
really in charge.
Let's use capital
punishment the same way
we use sports
and television
in this country
to distract people
and take their
minds off
how bad their being
fucked by the upper 1%.
Now unfortunately
unfortunately monday
night football
doesn't last long enough.
What we really need
is year round
capital punishment
on TV every night
with sponsors.
Got to have sponsors.
I'm sure as long
we're killing people
Marlboro cigarettes
and Dow Chemical
would be proud
to participate.
Proud to participate.
Balance the stupid
fucking budget.
And let me say this
to you my interesting
Judea Christian friends
not only
not only do I
recommend crucifixions
I'd be in favor of
bringing back beheadings.
Beheadings on TV,
slow motion,
instant replay
and maybe you
could let the heads
roll down a little hill
and fall into one of
five numbered holes.
Yeah.
Let the people at home
gamble on which hole
the head is going
to fall into.
And you do it in a stadium
so the mob can
gamble on it too.
Raise a little more money
and if you want to expand
the violence a
little longer
to sell a few
more commercials
instead of
using an axe
you do the beheadings
with a hand saw.
Hey don't bail out on
me now God damn it.
The blood is already
on our hands
all were talking about
is a matter of degree.
You want something a
little more delicate?
We'll do the beheadings
with an olive fork.
That would be nice.
And it would take a
good Goddamn long time.
There's a lot of good
things we could be doing.
When's the last time
we burned someone
at the stake?
It's been too long.
Here's another form
of capital punishment
comes out of a nice rich
religious tradition,
burning people
at the stake
sponsor,
Bridgeford Charcoal.
And you put it on TV
on Sunday mornings.
The Sunday morning
Evangelical
Send Us An Offering
Praise Jesus
Human Bonfire.
You don't think that
would get big ratings
in this sick
fucking country?
Shit you'd have people
skipping church to
watch this stuff.
And you take the
money they send in
the offerings and
you use it
To balance the budget.
What about boiling
people in oil?
Boy those were the
days weren't they?
You get the oil going
real good, you know?
A nice high rolling boil
and then slowly at
the end of a rope
you lower the
perpetrator head first
into the
boiling oil huh?
You talk about fun shit.
And just to encourage
citizen participation
you let the mob
in the stadium
control the speed
of the rope.
Good clean, wholesome
family entertainment.
The kids will love it.
The kids will love it
and at the same time
their enjoying themselves
were teaching them
a nice Christian
moral lesson.
Oiling people in oil.
Sponsor, Crisco.
And maybe instead of
boiling all these guys
every now and then
you could French fry
a couple of them.
French fried felons.
Dip a guy in egg batter
just for a goof you know?
Kind of a tempura
thing huh?
Jeffrey Dahmer
never thought of
this shit did he?
Jeffrey Dahmer eat
your heart out,
which is an interesting
thought in of itself.
All right enough
nostalgia
what about some
modern forms
of capitol
punishment?
How about we
throw a guy
off the World Trade Center
and whoever he lands on
wins the Publishers
Clearing House huh?
Okay something a little
more sophisticated:
You dip a guy
in brown gravy
and lock him in a small
room with a wolverine
who's high on angel dust.
There's one guy
that's not going to be
fucking with too many kids
at the bus stop
for a while huh?
Here's something really
nice you could do.
You shoot a guy out of
a high-speed catapult
right into a brick wall.
Trouble is it would
be over too quick.
No good for
TV you know,
you'd have to do a
whole bunch of guys
right in a row.
Rapid-fire capital
punishment.
Fifteen catapults while
you're shooting off one
you're loading
up the others.
Of course every
now and then
you would have to stop
to clean off the wall.
Cleanliness right
next to Godliness.
All right high tech.
I sense some of you's are
waiting for high tech.
I got it.
You take a small
tactical nuclear weapon
and stick it
up a guy's ass.
A thermal nuclear
suppository.
Preparation-H Bomb.
You talk about
fallout huh?
Whoa!
Or you take the bomb
and you stick it just
inside that little hole
on the end of a
guy's dick you know?
Yeah.
A bomb in a dick.
When it goes off the
guy wouldn't know
whether he was
coming or going.
Get out of here.
I got you.
Hey
listen
Hey
I got a lot
of good ideas.
Balance the stupid
fucking budget.
Here's another idea.
I'm going to save you
a whole lot of
money on prisons
but at the same time
we are still going to
remove from society
many of our more
unannoying citizens.
Four groups are going
away permanently.
First group
violent criminals.
Here's what you do with
these Emmy Award winners.
You take the entire
state of Kansas,
you move everybody out.
You give them a couple
hundred dollars
for their inconvenience
you know?
That'll be fair
and then you
move them out,
you put a big ten-story
electric fence
around Kansas and
Kansas becomes
a permanent prison farm
for violent criminals.
No parole, no
police, no supplies
the only thing
you give them
is lethal weapons
and live ammunition
so they can communicate
in a meaningful way.
Then you put the whole
thing on cable TV.
The violence network, VNN
and for a
corporate sponsor
you get one of
those company's
that loves to smear
its logo feces
all over the landscape,
Budweiser will
jump at this shit
in half a minute.
All right next group,
sex criminals.
Completely incurable
you got to lock them up.
You could outlaw religion
and most of
these sex crimes
would disappear in a
couple of generations
but we don't have time
for rational solutions.
Much easier to fence off
another rectangular state.
Rectangular states
are cheaper to fence,
saves the taxpayers
money you know?
This time Wyoming
but only for true
sex offenders.
We're not going to
bother consenting adults
who like to dress up
in leather Boy
Scout uniforms
and smash each
other in the head
with ballpeen hammers
while they take turns
blowing their cat.
There's certainly
nothing wrong with that.
It's a victimless hobby
and think of how good
the cat must feel.
No were only
going to lock up
rapist and molesters,
those hopeless romantics
who are so full of love
they can't help getting
a little of it on you.
Usually on your leg.
You take all these heavy
breathing fun seekers
and you stick
them in Wyoming
and you let them suck,
fuck and fondle.
You let them blow,
chew, sniff, lick, whip,
gobble and corn
hole each other
until their testicles
are whistling
O'Come All Ye Faithful.
Then you turn
on the cameras
and you got the
Sperm Channel
and don't forget our
corporate sponsor,
were going to
let Budweiser
put little logo patches
on the rapists
pants right here,
This Pud's for You.
All right next group,
drug addicts
and alcoholics.
Not all of them,
don't get nervous,
just the ones who are
making life difficult
for at least one
other person.
And were not going to
bother first offenders.
People deserve a
chance to clean up.
Everyone will get
twelve chances
to clean up.
Okay.
All right.
Fifteen... fifteen.
That's fine and that's it.
If you can't make
it in fifteen tries
off you go
To Colorado.
Colorado,
a perfect place
for staying loaded.
Each week all of
the illegal drugs
confiscated in
the United States
that the police and DEA
don't keep for their
own personal use,
will be air dropped
into Colorado.
And were going to turn
the Coors Brewery
over to the beer
drinking assholes
and everyone can stay
wasted, wired, stoned,
bombed, hammered,
smashed and shit-faced
around the clock
on another new
cable channel,
Shit Faced Central
this is the real
Rocky Mountain High!
Okay I've saved my
favorite group for last.
The maniacs and
crazy people.
Yeah.
The ones who live out
where the buses don't run.
And I distinguish between
maniacs and crazy people.
A maniac will beat
nine people to death
with a steel dildo.
A crazy person will beat
nine people to death
with a steel dildo
but he'll be wearing
a Bugs Bunny suit
at the time.
So you can't put
them all away.
You know you got to keep
some of them around
just for the
entertainment.
Like a guy who tells you
that the King of Sweden
is using his penis
as a radio transmitter
to send anti-Semitic
lesbian meatloaf recipes
to Soupy Sales and
Marvin Hamlish.
A guy like that
you want to give him
his own radio show.
No the maniac farm
will be reserved
strictly for
hopeless cases
like a guy who
gets a big tattoo
on his chest of Liza
Minnelli taking a shit.
You know?
And he tells you if he
wiggles a certain way
it looks like she's
wiping her ass you know?
A guy like that you want
to get him into custody
as quickly as possible.
Now for the maniac farm
I think there's
no question
we got to go with Utah.
Utah, easy to
fence... easy to fence,
right next to
Wyoming and Colorado
and Colorado is
right next Kansas
and that means
all four groups
of our most
amusing citizens
are now in one place
except for the big fences
and I think I
have another one
of my really good
ideas for cable TV.
Gates.
Small sliding gates
in the fences.
Think of what
you got here.
Think of what you've got.
Predators, degenerates,
crack heads and
fruitcakes.
Nine hundred miles of
fence separating them.
Every fifty miles you
put a small sliding gate
but the gates are
only ten inches wide
and there only
open once a month
for seven seconds.
And you know something
fuck cable
this shit has got to
be on pay-per-view.
Because if those
gates are only open
seven seconds a month
you are going to have
some mighty
interesting people
pushing and shoving
to be first on line.
Deeply disturbed,
armed, cranky lunatics
on drugs.
You know the ones.
A lot of tattoos,
lot of teeth broken
off at the gum line,
the true face of America
and every time you
open the gates
a few of the more
aggressive ones
are going to get through.
The crème da la crème.
The alphas.
They're going
to get through.
Their going to
find each other
and their going
to cross breed
and pretty soon you
have a melting pot.
Child killers,
corpse fuckers,
drug zombies and
full-blown wackoloons
wondering the landscape
in search of
truth and fun.
Just like now.
Everyone will have guns.
Everyone will have drugs
and no one will
be in charge.
Just like now.
But at least we'll
have a balanced budget.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey time for a
few fart jokes.
Where would a
comedy show be
without a few fart jokes?
Question
Did you ever have to fart
on a bus or an airplane
or in some public place
but you hadn't been
farting all that day
so you didn't really know
the nature of the beast.
You only knew there
was lots of it.
In a situation like that
what you have to do
is to release
a test fart.
You have to
arrange to release
quietly
and in a carefully
controlled manner
about ten to
fifteen percent
of the total fart
in order to determine
if those around
you can handle it.
Or... or if in fact
you may be about
to precipitate
a public health emergency.
When releasing a test
fart it is often good
to engage in an
act of subterfuge,
such as reaching
for a magazine.
Say,
is that Golf Digest?
That doesn't smell
too horrifying.
In fact in an odd way
it's rather pleasant.
I think they
ought to enjoy
the rest of this baby.
And it turns out to be
one of those farts
that would strip the
varnish off a footlocker.
A fart that could
end a marriage.
And everyone around you
heads for the exits.
Even the people
on the airplane.
As you realize it is time
to review your
fiber intake.
It might not be
necessary after all
each morning to eat an
entire wicker swing set.
I have no ending for this
so I take a small bow.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Okay.
And this next thing
this next thing is about
the English language.
It's about little
expressions we use.
We all say them.
The little sayings and
expressions that we use
all the time most of us
and we never really seem
to examine these
expressions
very carefully at all
we just sort of
say these things
as if they really
made sense.
Like "Legally drunk."
Well if it's legal
what's the
fucking problem?
Hey,
leave my friend
alone officer
he's legally drunk.
"You know where
can stick it."
Well why do we always
assume everyone knows
where they can stick it?
Suppose you don't know.
Suppose you're a new guy.
You have absolutely no
idea where to stick it.
I think there
ought to be
a government
booklet entitled,
"Where to Stick It."
Now that I think
of it I believe
there is a government
booklet like that.
They send it to
you on April 15th.
"Undisputed Heavy
Weight Champion."
Well if it's undisputed
what's all the
fighting about?
"It's the quiet ones
you got to watch."
You know that one huh?
Every time you
see a story
about a serial
killer on TV
what do they do?
They bring on the neighbor
and then the
neighbor says,
Well he was always
very quiet.
And someone in
the room says,
It's the quiet ones
you got to watch.
This sounds to me
like a very
dangerous assumption.
I will bet you anything
that while you're
watching the quiet one
a noisy one will
fucking kill you.
Suppose you're in a bar
and one guy sitting
over on the side
reading a book not
bothering anybody,
another guy standing
up at the front
with a machete banging
on the bar saying,
I'll kill the next
motherfucker who
comes in here.
Who you going to watch?
You're God damn right.
"Lock them up and
throw away the key."
This is really stupid.
Where you going
to throw the key?
Right out in
front of the jail?
His friends will find it.
How far can you
throw a key?
Fifty, sixty
feet the most.
Even if you lay it flat
on its side like that
and you scale it
what do you get an
extra ten feet tops.
This is a stupid idea.
Needs to be
completely rethought.
"Down the tubes."
You hear that one
alot, people say,
Awe the country is
going down the tubes.
What tubes?
Have you seen any tubes?
Where are these tubes?
And where do they go?
And how come there's
more than one tube?
It would seem to me
one country one tube.
What does every state
all of a sudden
have to have it's
own tube now?
One tube is all you need.
But a tube that big
somebody would have
seen it by now.
Somebody would have said,
Hey Joey... Joey look
at the fucking tube.
Big ass fucking
tube over here.
You never here that.
You know why?
No tubes.
We don't have tube one.
We are essentially
tubeless.
"Takes the cake."
You know?
Say, Boy he really
takes the cake.
Where?
Where do you take a
cake to the movies?
You know where I
would take a cake
down to the bakery
to see the other cakes.
And how come he
takes the cake?
How come he don't
take the pie?
The pie is easier to
carry than the cake.
"Easy as pie."
Hey wait,
cake is not too hard
to carry either.
"Piece of cake."
"The greatest thing
since sliced bread."
So this is it huh folks?
A couple hundred
thousand years.
The fucking pyramids
for Christ sakes.
Panama Canal.
The Great Wall of China.
Even a lava lamp
to me is greater
than sliced bread.
What's so great
about sliced bread?
You got a knife: You
got a loaf of bread
slice the fucking thing!
And get on with your life.
"Out walking the streets."
You know guy
gets a parole.
They say, Now instead
of being in prison
this guy is out
walking the streets.
How do we know?
Maybe the guy's home
banging the babysitter.
Not everybody that
gets a parole
is out walking the
fucking streets.
A lot of times they
steal a car you know?
So we ought to be glad.
Thank God he stole a car.
At least he's not out
walking the streets.
"Fine and dandy."
That's an old fashioned
one that ya hear.
Say to a guy, How are ya?
Just fine and dandy.
Not me.
I never say that.
You know how come?
Cause I'm never both
of those things
at the same time.
Sometimes I'm
fine not dandy.
Close to dandy.
Approaching dandy.
In the vicinity
of dandy hood
not quite fully dandy.
Other times I am
indeed highly dandy.
However, not fine.
One time
One time
in 1965
August for about an hour
I was both fine and
dandy at the same time
but nobody asked
me how I was.
And I could
have told them.
Could have told them.
Could have told them.
I could have said
to the person,
fine and dandy...
I consider it a
lost opportunity.
"Walking papers."
You know?
Guy gets fired.
You say, Gees poor guy.
Well they give him his
walking papers today.
Did you ever get
any walking papers?
Seriously?
Believe me in my life
I got fired a
lot of times.
You can tell.
Never got any
walking papers.
Never got a pink
slip either.
You know what I would get?
A guy would come around
to my desk and say,
Get the fuck out of here!
You don't need
paper for that.
It's like "The
Riot Act."
"The Riot Act."
They keep telling you
their going to
read that to you.
Have you heard
this thing at all?
Especially when
you're a kid
they threaten you.
You wait till your
father comes home.
He's going to read
you the riot act.
Tell him I already
read it myself
and I didn't
like it either.
I consider it wordy
and poorly thought out.
He wants to read me
something how about
'The Gentleman's Guide
to the Golden Age
of Blow Jobs.'
"More than happy."
I bet you say that
sometimes don't you?
Once in a while you
say to somebody,
Oh I'd be more than
happy to do that.
How can you be
more than happy?
To me this sounds
like a dangerous
mental condition.
We had to put Dave
in the mental home.
He was
more than happy.
One more of these.
"In your own words."
People say that to you?
You know when you
hear that a lot
in a classroom
or in a courtroom
they'll say to you,
Tell us in your own words.
Do you have
your own words?
Hey I'm using the ones
everybody else
has been using.
Next time they tell
you to say something
in your own words say,
Nik flak flarnee
kloundo floo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now this next piece of
material is real simple
it's called
free-floating hostility.
Twenty-four minor
culture items
I'm bored with tired
of and pissed at.
So I hope you're ready
for a little random anger.
People
People
People who make
quote marks
in the air with
their finger.
Are you tired of
these people yet?
He said he was, "Sober."
Hey lady,
"Eat me."
Budda-boom budda-bing.
Next guy says to me
budda-boom budda-bing
is getting kicked right
in the fucking nuts.
Budda-boom mother fucker!
You want to
try budda-bing?
Bad hair day.
Where did this
shit come from?
What a superficial
culture.
Put on a hat and go to
work you shallow cunt.
It's a good thing
Lewis and Clark
never had a
bad hair day
or Daniel Boone huh?
Kuster he had a
really bad hair day
but he had it
coming that blond,
blue-eyed criminal fuck.
What about these
guys that tell you,
I heard that.
I heard that.
Ah you did, did you?
Well isn't this exciting.
What is this a
fucking hearing test?
Did I wonder into a
Beltone commercial here?
Of course you heard
you fucking nimrod
I'm standing
right next to ya.
I'm going to
move down here.
I'm going to move a
little farther away.
Blow me!
By any chance did
you here that?
What about these
people who tell you
their needs
aren't being met?
You run into this stuff?
This is support
group shit.
Twelve steppers.
My needs aren't being met.
Know what I tell them?
Drop some of your needs.
Life is a zero sum game.
What else is troubling me?
Mickey Mouse's birthday
being announced
on the television news
as if it's an
actual event.
I don't give a shit.
If I cared about Mickey
Mouse's birthday
I'd have memorized
it years ago
and I'd send him a card.
Dear Mickey,
Happy Birthday.
Love, George.
I don't do that why?
I don't give a shit.
Fuck Mickey Mouse.
Fuck him in the asshole
with a big rubber dick.
Then break it off
and beat him with
the rest of it.
I hope Mickey dies.
I do, I hope he
Goddamn dies.
I hope he gets a hold
of some tainted cheese
and dies lonely
and forgotten
behind the baseboard
of a soiled bathroom
in a poor neighborhood
with his hand in
Goofy's pants.
Mickey Mouse, no wonder
no one in the world takes
our country serious.
Do we waste valuable
television time
informing our
citizens of the age
of an imaginary rodent!
Now let me ask you this,
the two pandas in the zoo
do you care if they fuck?
I don't.
Why don't they stop
telling me on the news
the pandas didn't
fuck again this year?
I'm not concerned.
I have no emotional stake
in panda fucking
all right?
If they want to they will.
If not they'll watch
the Price is Right.
Probably the only reason
they're not
doing it on time
is cause some jack off
from the environmental
movement
has moved into the
cage with them.
Could you get a hard on
if some guy in a green
T-shirt with a stopwatch
was taking your
girlfriends rectal
temperature?
Leave these
creatures alone.
And
let me get a sip of
water here, hold on.
All right.
And as long as were
talking about the news
I don't want to
hear anything more
about sperm egg
donor surrogate
invetro test tube
biological adoptive
foster parents who
want their baby back.
Baby Jane, Baby Ruth,
Baby This, Baby That,
Baby It's Cold Outside,
I don't give a shit.
Leave me alone and
keep it off my TV.
Sick American shit.
I'm also tired
of hearing about
innocent victims.
This is an outmoded idea.
There are no
innocent victims.
If you live on this planet
you're guilty period.
Fuck you.
End of report next case.
Next fucking case.
Next case.
You're birth certificate
is proof of guilt.
And what happened in this
country that now suddenly
everyone is walking around
with their own personal
bottle of water?
When did we get so
thirsty in America?
Is everybody
so dehydrated
they have to have
their own portable
supply of fluids
with them at all times?
Get a drink before
you leave the house.
Another crime
against society,
hyphenated names.
Hey lady pick a fucking
name would you please?
Pick a fucking name.
Hi I'm Emily
Jericho-Fordescu.
Hi I'm George
Jerk-Me-Off-Fuck-You-Too.
You don't acquire
personal dignity
by adding a name
to your name.
Feminists think
it's a radical act.
It's not.
Castrating a guy
in a parking lot
with a Coke bottle
is a radical act.
Hyphenating your name
is pretentious bullshit.
And what is going
on with all these
telephone-calling plans?
MCI, AT& T is this
shit really necessary?
When did the
phone bill become
life's most
critical document?
In a country
where you can buy
cinnamon dental floss,
cheese in a spray can
and eatable
women's panties
are people really
breaking their balls
to save nine cents on
a fucking phone call?
You know?
Talking to your
mother once a year
might not be
the most pleasant
thing in the world
but it should not be seen
as a critical
spending decision.
Something else I
don't understand
motivation tapes.
Motivation books.
What happened here?
Suddenly everybody
needs to be motivated?
It's a fairly
simple thing.
Either you want to do
something or you don't?
What's the big mystery?
Besides if you're
motivated enough
to go the store to
by a motivation book
aren't you motivated
enough to do that
so you don't
need the book?
Put it back.
Tell the clerk, Fuck you.
I'm motivated.
I'm going home.
I'm going home.
And can anyone
explain to me
the need for one hour
photo finishing?
You just saw the
fucking thing.
How can you possibly be
nostalgic about a concept
like a little while ago?
Another complaint,
too many vehicles.
There are some families
in this country
own entirely too
many vehicles.
You see them on the
highway in an RV.
But that's not
enough for them.
RV's not enough.
Behind them they're
towing a motorboat,
go-cart, dune buggy,
dirt bike, Jet Ski,
snow mobile,
parasail, hand glider,
wind surfing equipment,
a hot air balloon
and a small two-man
deep-sea diving bell.
Doesn't anyone just take
a fucking walk anymore?
The only thing
these people lack
is a lunar
excursion module.
Too many choices America.
It's not healthy.
Another abomination,
white guys
over ten years of age
who wear their baseball
hats backwards.
Listen to me.
White guys let me
tell you something.
You're never going to be
as cool as black guys.
It's not going to happen.
You're white
and you're lame.
It's a fucking
law of nature.
Turning your hat around
and learning a
complicated handshake
will not make you cool.
And you black guys
since you started
the whole thing
I'm going to let you
stay with the hats
a little bit longer
but I think really
once you qualify
for social security
it's time to spin
that motherfucker
around to the
front of you.
All right?
Yeah.
Another tip... another
tip for the men.
The earring.
The thing with
the earrings.
It's over.
It's been over
for a long time.
Doesn't mean
anything anymore.
It was supposed to
piss off the squares.
The squares are
wearing them now.
Doesn't mean anything.
It's just fucking jewelry.
Unless you have an earring
with a live baby
hanging from it
it's just jewelry.
And I want you to know
I'm in favor of
self-mutilation
and personal
disfigurement.
I've always said there's
nothing like puncturing
and perforating your skin
in a dozen or so places
in order to demonstrate
your high self-esteem.
When I see a young man
decorating his scalp
with a soldering
iron I say,
There's a happy guy.
Thinks highly of himself.
And haven't we gone a
little overboard with
these colored ribbons
for different causes?
Every cause has it's
own colored ribbon now.
Red for AIDS.
Blue for child abuse.
Pink for breast cancer.
Green for the rain forest.
Purple for urban violence.
I got a brown one.
You know what it means?
Eat shit motherfucker!
Eat shit motherfucker!
And what can we do
to silence these
Christian athletes
who thank Jesus
whenever they win,
never mention his
name when they lose.
Not a word.
You never hear them say,
Jesus made me
drop the ball.
The good Lord
tripped me up
behind the line
of scrimmage.
According to these guys
Jesus is undefeated.
Meanwhile, these assholes
are in last place.
Must be another one
of those miracles.
And speaking of
delusional people
what about a guy who
hears a voice in his head
tells him to kill
his entire family
so he does it?
Is this the only thing
a voice in the head
ever tells these
people to do
is to kill others?
Doesn't a voice
ever tell a guy?
Go take a shit on the
salad bar at Wendy's.
Doesn't a voice... doesn't
a voice tell a guy
to take out his dick
on the merry-go-round
once in a while?
Well some guys
do take out their dicks
on the merry-go-round
but usually it's
their own idea.
Something else I
can do without,
aftershave and cologne
and this disgusting shit
that men put on
their bodies.
Just what I need
in the elevator
some guy standing
next to me
smells like a
fucking pine tree.
I say, Go home and
wash you smelly prick.
You smell like the urinal
in a Portuguese cathouse.
Goddamn guys are stupid.
Guys are really
fucking dumb.
They think they're
going to get laid
with stuff you know?
Oh yeah they put
it on at home.
Oh boy, oh boy I'll
get laid tonight.
I'll get laid tonight.
You don't get laid
with green shit
that comes out of
a bottle okay?
The only smell
that's going to
help you get laid
might be your own
natural scent.
You have pheromones
it's a secondary
sex characteristic.
People in America they're
all nervous about sex.
They want to cover it
up and disguise it.
Guys in Europe they
know how to live.
Guy gets in an
elevator over there
he smells like a
pile of dog shit.
Those people are
sophisticated.
Getting pretty tired of
these guys walking around
in cowboy hats
and cowboy boots.
You ever see
these jack offs?
Can't we kill some of
these motherfuckers?
Walking around in a
fucking cowboy hat.
Grown men.
It's not even Halloween
for Christ sakes.
I say, Hey Tex
grow up and get
yourself a wardrobe
consistent with the
century you're living in.
Why do certain
men feel the need
to dress up as
mythic figures?
You don't see anyone
walking around
in a pirate
costume do you?
When was the last
guy you ran into
had on a Viking outfit?
Make believe cowboys,
closest they ever
got to a cow
is when they stopped to
take a piss at an Arby's.
And camcorders.
Here is technology
gone bezerk.
Everywhere you go now
there's some dick,
some yo-yo,
some putts
with a camcorder
and he is going to
tape everything.
Doesn't anyone
in this country
just stop and look
at things anymore?
Sort of take them in.
Maybe even remember them.
Is that such a
strange notion?
Does experience have
to be documented
and brought home and
saved on the shelf?
And do people really
watch this shit?
Are people's lives so
bankrupt they sit at home
looking at things
they already did?
And these guys are
so intense you know?
It's always guys
they won't let women
touch the cameras.
It's a highly
technical skill.
Look for a hole,
push on a button,
big skill and there
they all think there
Federico Fillini
you ever see
Low angles, zooms and pans
and it's the same
ugly three children
in every Goddamn shot.
All the George Lucas
magic in Hollywood
is not going to change
the unfortunate
genetic configuration
on the faces of
these children.
Keep these unfortunate
youngsters
out of public view.
Now
a lot of these
hold on a second
a lot of these
cultural crimes
I've been
complaining about
can be blamed on
the baby boomers.
Something else
I'm a little tired
of hearing about,
the baby boomers.
Whiney, narcissistic,
self-indulgent people
with a simple philosophy,
Give me that it's mine.
Give me that it's mine!
These people were
given everything.
Everything was
handed to them
and they took it all.
Took it all.
Sex, drugs and
rock-n-roll
and they stayed loaded
for twenty years
and had a free ride
but now there staring
down the barrel
of middle age burn out
and they don't like it.
They don't like it
so they've turned
self-righteous
and they want
to make things
hard on younger people.
They tell them to
abstain from sex.
Say no to drugs.
As for the rock-n-roll
they sold to
television commercials
a long time ago
so they could buy
pasta machines
and Stairmasters
and soybean futures.
Soybean futures.
You know something?
They're cold,
bloodless people.
It's in there slogans.
It's in there rhetoric.
No pain, no gain.
Just do it.
Life is short play hard.
Shit happens deal with it.
Get a life.
These people went from
do your own thing
to just say no.
They went from love
is all you need
to whoever winds up with
the most toys wins.
And they went from
cocaine to Rogaine.
And you know something
they're still
counting grams
only now it's fat grams.
And the worst of it is
the rest of us
have to watch these
commercials on TV
for Levi's loose
fitting jeans
and fat ass Docker pants
because these degenerate
yuppies boomer cocksuckers
couldn't keep
they're hands off
the croissants
and the Hagendass
and their big fat asses
have spread all over
and they have to wear
fat ass Docker pants.
Fuck these boomers.
Fuck these yuppies
and fuck everybody
now that I think
about of it.
Well sometimes in comedy
you have to generalize.
Now there's one thing
you might have noticed
I don't complain about,
politicians.
Everybody complains
about politicians.
Everybody says they suck.
Well where do people think
these politicians
come from?
They don't fall
out of the sky.
They don't pass
through a membrane
from another reality...
They come from
American parents
and American families,
American homes,
American schools,
American churches,
American businesses
and American universities
and they're elected
by American citizens.
This is the best
we can do folks.
This is what we
have to offer.
It's what our
system produces.
Garbage in, garbage out.
If you have selfish
ignorant citizens
if you have selfish,
ignorant citizens
your going to get
selfish, ignorant leaders
and term limits ain't
going to do you any good
you're just
going to wind up
with a brand
new bunch of
selfish, ignorant
Americans.
So maybe, maybe, maybe
it's not the
politicians who suck.
Maybe something else
sucks around here
like the public.
Yeah the public sucks.
There's a nice campaign
slogan for somebody.
The public
sucks, fuck hope.
Fuck hope.
Because if it's really
just the fault of
these politicians
then where are all
the other bright
people of conscience?
Where are all the
bright honest
intelligent Americans
ready to step in
and save the nation
and lead the way?
We don't have people like
that in this country.
Everybody's at the mall
scratching his ass,
picking his nose,
taking his credit card
out of his Fannie pack
and buying a
pair of sneakers
with lights in them.
So I have solved this
little political dilemma
for myself in a
very simple way
on Election Day
I stay home.
I don't vote.
Fuck them.
Fuck them.
I don't vote.
Two reasons... two
reasons I don't vote.
First of all,
it's meaningless.
This country was bought
and sold and paid for
a long time ago.
The shit they shuffle
around every four years
Doesn't mean a
fucking thing.
And secondly
I don't vote
cause I believe
if you vote
you have no right
to complain.
People like to
twist that around
I know they say... they say,
Well if you don't vote you
have no right to complain.
But where's the
logic in that.
If you vote
and you elect dishonest,
incompetent people
and they get into office
and screw everything up
well you are responsible
for what they have done.
You caused the problem.
You voted them in.
You have no right
to complain.
I on the other hand,
who did not vote,
who did not vote,
who in fact,
did not even leave the
house on Election Day
am in no way responsible
for what these
people have done
and have every
right to complain
as loud as I want
about the mess you created
that I had nothing
to do with.
So I know that a little
later on this year
you're going to
have another one of
those really swell
presidential elections
that you like so much.
You'll enjoy yourselves.
It will be a lot of fun.
I'm sure as soon as
the election is over
you're country will
improve immediately.
As for me I'll be
home on that day
doing essentially the
same thing as you
the only difference is
when I get finished
masturbating
I'm going to have a
little something to
show for it folks.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you everybody.
See ya later
