- Excuse me, are you the consul?
- Yes.
Connie Raynor
of Morning Post.
I'm fascinated to know what
His Majesty's Consul makes of it all.
I can't believe your readers will be
interested in our little ceremony.
Oh, they are. Since Mussolini,
we can't get enough of Italy.
Is this a regular group?
I mean, are they all friends?
Friends? The Italians
call them the Scorpioni.
- " Scorpioni" ? Why?
- Why? Because they bite.
Not me. They tried,
but I bite back.
Your Lady Hester seems
a formidable old battle-ax.
Ah, we live in an age
of great dictators.
- We are here today...
- Come!
to remember you...
Elizabeth Barrett Browning...
a true English lady...
who, with her poet husband,
Robert Browning...
found true happiness
in this glorious city of Florence..
thus celebrating the marriage
between our two great countries...
England and Italy.
My late husband,
the ambassador...
I wondered when we'd get
to her late husband.
always dreamt that England and Italy
would help form a united Europe.
- Mary seems to have a child with her.
- The dressmaker's child.
So we pay tribute to you,
dear Elizabeth...
who brought to this country
not only poetry...
but a fine example
of British motherhood.
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Please.
I'm sorry, Mary,
we had to start without you.
Arabella, your turn.
Veronica, please.
From English blood and Tuscan birth...
what country should we give her?
Instead of any on the earth,
the civic heavens receive her.
While the blue Tuscan sky
assumes--
While the blue Tuscan sky
entombs...
our English words of prayer.
Thank you, Arabella.
Thank you.
" Caro Signor Keegan.
Most respected
and famoso mercante di Manchester."
" Dear sir."
" I am in grande gratitudine
for the massive...
and importante...
bundle of silk...
which will bring--
which will bring...
lagrime allegre to the eyes
of molte bellissime...
Signore Florentine."
" Thank you for the consignment
of fabric.
It is up to
your usual standard."
" Please accept, signore,
my most humble compliments...
and sincerissimi good wishes."
" Yours sincerely--"
Ah, Miss Wallace,
that's all for today.
No, it isn't.
- What?
- Your son.
My son? He is
at the orphanage school. Why?
No, he isn't.
He ran away
to find his mother.
- That's the orphanage's business.
- You brought him into the world.
- You are responsible for him.
- Of course. I pay for his education.
And I still pay you to turn him
into a perfect British gentleman...
who'll speak better English
than mine.
What more can I do?
- Give him a home.
- Home?
The child will run away again.
I'm sure of it.
He's convinced his mother
will come back soon.
- Why don't you take him with you then?
- What?
I have been thinking about it
for some time.
He likes you.
He's happy with you, Miss Wallace.
You must take him with you
into your family.
- Well, you are his father.
- Of course I'm father.
Then try to persuade your wife.
Might do her good
to have a child to look after.
Can you imagine that my wife accept
a bastard in our house?
- My wife?
- Signor Guarnieri...
there are no illegitimate
children in this world...
only illegitimate parents.
Good boy. There.
- Say good morning to your father.
- Good morning.
You bring the child here?
The wife that can arrive any moment.
Miss Wallace, in England,
such behavior, it's perhaps possible.
But in Italy, believe me,
this is the end of the world.
Bring him back to the orphanage, subito,
or bring him to live with you...
or do what you want.
It's a responsibility
I cannot assume.
If you're married,
if you know what is love...
you understand certain situations
very, very delicate.
But you haven't answered
my question. What are we--
A lady has brought back
the child who ran away.
Luca, would you get the knives
and forks? You know where they are.
Oh, and the napkins, please.
Thank you. And glasses.
Who are they?
They're English soldiers.
- Is he your brother?
- No, Luca, I don't have a brother.
No, his name's Danny.
He's the young man
I was going to marry.
And that's my father.
They both went to fight
in the Great War...
and they didn't come back.
But they're always with me.
Now you get your chair.
There.
Haven't you ever had
bacon and eggs before?
Go on. Try it.
It's very good.
Can I stay here with you...
until my mother comes back?
Yes.
Just as long as you'd like.
Oh, the man is impossible.
- What did he say?
- It's no good.
He simply won't listen.
- It seems it's up to me.
- We'll all help you.
Well, it's my problem,
but you can all help if you will.
- Oh, of course.
- Of course we will.
Arabella-- Wednesday and Friday.
Could you do the art bit?
- You know, music, galleries.
- Yes, yes, fine. What else?
Well, fetch him from school
when I can't. And mealtimes.
- Molly?
- I know. Arabella does the Uffizi...
and I do the supper
three times a week.
- All right. Do you mind terribly?
- I might rather enjoy it.
I don't like this coughing.
She's been doing it all night.
Perhaps I should take her
to the vet.
- What was I saying?
- About art.
Italians breathe it in with the air
of Florence. Not like us cold English.
- Are you cold?
- Not me, Luca.
I have drunk deep
the wine of Firenze.
I've warmed both hands before the fires
of Botticelli and Michelangelo.
- Is she coughing again?
- Is she cold too?
Come on, come on.
We'll be late.
We've got to see this.
We've just got time before school,but this is something you mustn't miss.
I'll show you something
you will never forget.
You see, Luca...
Florence isn't just shiny cars
and ice creams, as little boys think.
It's the human form divine,
the body beautiful.
And you-- yes, you--
could be part of that world.
To make, to create...
to live
as those old artists did, Luca...
is to share a part
in the divine plan.
We must go. We're
going to be late for school.
Now, I'll be back later to
take you home. I must run to the vet.
Oh, well done, old girl.
You've done terribly well.
Come here.
Come here, I'm telling you.
You're right to be afraid of me.
I'll get you.
You'll tell your wife to leave the
child alone, or I'll call the police!
My wife's had a lot
to put up with.
What do you expect me
to do, lock her up?
Yes, if necessary. Will you please try
to understand what I'm telling you?
I might agree to look after Luca
on certain conditions.
As far as he's concerned,
you might not even exist.
Just give him some of the
valuable time you spend on your cloth...
and all the rest.
The child needs a father,
for God's sake!
Five lire--
in silver, eh--
for your pocket.
Grazie, Signor Guarnieri.
English. In English.
- Thank you, Mr. Guarnieri.
- That is better.
But why you not
call me Papa?
Because--
Because what?
Because you don't take me
to school on a bicycle.
Well, Miss Wallace takes you.
When is she coming back?
I don't know.
She's busy, you know.
In Paris. For her work.
Ah, bene.
She is there.
Luca, stop!
Luca, come back!
Luca, get in.
I'll see you next Sunday.
I thought my mother
had come back.
She will not be coming back.
I don't understand.
Why?
Do you remember the two photographs
you saw in my room?
Your soldiers
that didn't come back.
Yes.
But they're always with me,
even though they're not here.
Love doesn't die.
And in the same way, your mother
will always be with you...
even though she's--
Not here.
It's supposed to be
around here somewhere.
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where
a Signora Georgina Rockwell is?
You mean Georgie?
She's over there.
Thanks a million, kid.
Grandmama, do we really
need a tablecloth?
- Of course we do, Wilfred.
- But it always blows away.
Then find some little stones
and put them on the corners.
He really is quite charming,
Lady Hester, your grandson.
Poor boy. He lost his father
at Passchendaele.
And his mother was never very strong.
I've had to be father and mother to him.
- You've done a marvelous job.
- Thank you.
Don't I remember that
particularly ostentatious vehicle?
- Oh, no, it can't be.
- I think so.
Mrs. Morganthall is back.
Should we invite her to tea?
I think not.
Americans simply don't
understand picnics.
Georgie!
- Hey, Georgie!
- Elsa.
- Where in the hell have you been?
- Oh, sweetheart...
why do you have to do your digging
in these dusty, dirty places?
Oh, the American collectors
are back in Italy.
That's where
all the bargains are now.
And plenty of fakes as well.
You put your fofo in
You take your fofo out
Americans.
You know Cesare Poggi,
the art dealer, don't you?
Okay, well, he telephoned me
in Paris to--
Oh, my God, it was so hot there, you
could have fried an egg on the sidewalk.
- Hold that for me.
- And Cesare said--
He said he'd just found
the first version...
of Picasso's
Desmoiselles d'Avignon.
- And you bought it?
- Well, of course, l--
Connie Raynor of the Morning Post
in London. You mind if I take notes?
- No.
- Yes, we--
No, I want everyone
to hear about this.
Anyway, when he called,
I said " yes" immediately...
but that penny-pinching son-of-a-bitch
husband of mine said " no" ...
pitched a fit
and then faked a heart attack.
But I say good riddance
to bad rubbish.
- No, she really does not mean--
- Oh, I really do. I really do.
What I can't get over
is that he's too cheap...
to slip a poor girl
a little Picasso.
- Hard to believe.
- I know.
- Maybe you could sell this and buy it.
- No, I couldn't.
I want to keep this one, thank you
very much. But mark my words...
I'm gonna have that goddamn painting
if it's the last thing I do.
And she will, believe me.
It was very sweet of you to point me
in the right direction. Here.
My God, look at you!
You have sprung up like a little bean
sprout since the last time I saw you.
Oh, my goodness,
look at you!
Now, you tell your mother that I'm going
to need a completely new wardrobe...
so I plan to keep her
as busy as a little beaver.
She's really better than anyone else.
Better than Schiapparelli--
- Elsa.
- What?
There was no chance
to tell you, but Clara's dead.
- My God, Georgie.
- Nothing to be done. Just--
But what about the boy?
One of the English women, Mary Wallace,
has been looking after him.
Will you tell this Mary Wallace
that I want to talk with her?
It's too bad. Now go away.
Please, go away.
- Prego, m'lady.
- Oh! Thank you.
- Could I take a photograph?
- Oh, yes.
Look, everybody knows
how I live my life.
I live my life like a crazy woman,
but I loved Clara.
We had this
strange relationship.
She didn't even bill me sometimes,
but that's beside the point.
And I know what kind of a hard time
Luca's father gave her.
- I'm sure he's not even helping you.
- Sometimes.
I'm sure you're being too kind.
Anyway, I know that I owe her a lot
of money, and I was thinking that...
possibly, I would put the money
into a trust for Luca...
y quiero saber
qué piensa Ud. al respecto.
It would make all the difference
to his life.
Well, it's not a lot of money,
you know. It's just enough to give him--
- Independence.
- Yes.
Thank you.
Oh, do look. Oh, look.
Look at that ridiculous American
monstrosity they've given the child.
What do they call them?
Knickerbocker Glories.
It's amazing, you know.
They can even vulgarize ice cream.
Don't worry.
We're all taking care of him.
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?
It's one thing
to take care of stray dogs.
It's quite another
to take care of stray boys.
Elsa, darling!
Don't give me that " Elsa, darling" crap.
- Now where's my goddamn Picasso?
- If you'd sent the money when I...
I told you that Morganthall wouldn't
give me the money then, Cesee.
Goddamn it. What? Buy it back.
Offer them more money.
- No, Elsa, please.
- I want it now.
Georgie, do you understand
what I'm saying?
I know exactly
what you're talking about.
Okay, Elsa, I try for you.
Okay? I promise.
I don't want you to try.
I want you to get it.
Yes, I will get it.
Okay?
Is that an Italian " get it"
or an American " get it" ?
I will get it for you, okay?
I'm sorry I got mad at you.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- Thank you, thank you.
I just love this painting
so much.
I know, I know.
Oh, I'm sorry, Elsa.
My back.
I had some problem for two days.
I think you prefer to dance with
these young people. They drove me here.
This is Fabio, the pianist.
- This is Carlo. This is Fabrizio.
- How do you do?
Come on, Fabrizio.
You dance with me.
Oh, Cesee,
thank you so much.
I think it's better for you
to dance with them.
Well, you don't
have to twist my arm.
Come on, Fabrizio.
I choose you.
That's my girl.
Now here's a dancer,
could dance the feet off you boys.
" Bellissima." I know that's good,
but what is it? What am I doing good?
- You dance very well.
- Thank you. Yes, of course, I do.
You should have seen her
on Broadway.
Elsa Paris--
Ziegfeld star.
Three years running, until she
threw it up for Mr. Morganthall.
He wanted
a private performance.
And, boy, has he been paying
for it ever since.
Bernard, we need
some more champagne.
You're not gonna
need that, Connie.
When laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
And I just smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
Are all American women
as exciting as you?
Alas, no.
Go, go, you have it!
Come on, Luca! Dribble, dribble!
No, Luca,
to your left, to your left.
No, Luca,
pass it to your left!
Shoot! Yeah! Luca! Yeah ! Goal!
Goal!
We win!
Luca, yeah!
You are the best, Luca!
It's Mussolini's
finest achievement--
discipline, order,
safety in the streets.
And invaded Abyssinia.
Well, why shouldn't Mussolini
have an empire?
All the best people in Europe
have empires.
- May I quote you?
- Yes, you may.
Tell them in England
the truth about Mussolini.
Such a vibrant man--
a Roman emperor.
Welcome back. It is
so lovely to see you again.
John!
What do you think
of our new Augustus of Italy?
Musso? Ooh? I think his butt's
too big to push around the dance floor.
Oh, dreadful.
Why, Hester,
I didn't see you there. Luciano!
Elsa, my dear.
Flagrantly immoral.
I'm throwing this little shindig tonight
to say good-bye and thank you...
'cause, alas, I have to
love you and leave you.
We'll have to be
terribly brave about that.
- Don't go. Florence needs you.
- Oh, Paolo, thank you so much.
But just for a little while,
because tomorrow Cesee and I...
are going to Paris where I got
the chance to buy a certain Picasso...
and get my skinflint husband
to pay for it.
But tonight, I want everybody to have
a wonderful time and drink up...
because the champagne's on me.
For she's a jolly good fellow
Oh, my goodness, that Doney's should
come to this. It's too much. Too much.
What did she say she wanted
to lay her hands on?
- A Picasso.
- Who's he?
He's a picture, dear.
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny
For she's a jolly good fellow
I'm Giulia Meyer,
a friend of Mrs. Morganthall.
- Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
- Sit down, please.
Elsa wants you and your friends
to join us in the celebration.
- How very kind.
- Oh, do thank her.
I'd bathe in the stuff
to celebrate her departure.
Which nobody can deny
You like this? This is okay.
It's a good copy, a Roman copy.
But this-- Come.
I want you to see this.
Ah, it's Hellenistic.
Authentic 150 B.C.
" Venere e Amore."
"Venus and Eros."
That's very good, Luca.
For seven,
that's excellent.
It's much better
than a lot of amateur artists.
Where did you learn to do that?
We'll start again from
the middle of the balcony scene...
where Juliet is on the balcony...
and Romeo is down below.
Let's put the light
back on the stage.
There.
Now--
" Lady, by yonder
blessed moon I swear.
That tips with splendor
all these fruit-tree tops."
" Oh, swear not by the moon,
the inconstant moon...
that monthly changes
in her circled orbit...
lest that of thy love
prove likewise variable."
- What does that mean?
-" Variable" ?
Changeable, changing.
Things that don't always
stay the same.
I see-- vario.
Yes. " Vario."
And Juliet knows that
true love is not vario.
It lasts forever.
It's the most important thing in life.
- Now it's Romeo's turn.
-" What shall I swear by?"
" Do not swear at all.
Or, if thou wilt...
swear by thy gracious self...
which is the god of my idolatry,
and I'll believe thee."
Now he comes up to the balcony.
Now let's go back
to the beginning again.
Oh, my God!
Wilfred, where do you think
you're going?
- Wilfred, come and sit down.
- Grandmama, this man is hurt!
The world's gone mad.
Damn Fascists!
Shame on you! Shame on you!
This isn't the Fascists.
This is the anarchists.
Mussolini has no idea
what is being done here.
If my husband were alive,
he would go to Rome and tell him.
Perhaps I should take on
the role of ex-ambassador...
and go to Rome myself.
Is she serious
about seeing Mussolini?
There's no doubt she'll try.
Happily, she won't succeed.
But I might be able to swing it...
journalist on an important
British paper.
Please, Miss Raynor,
leave diplomacy...
to the diplomats.
One is the widow
of Sir Hector Random...
the British Ambassador
from 1926 to 1929...
as you will undoubtedly remember.
The other is a reporter
from the Morning Post.
I think it's about
what's happening in Florence.
We must admit
it was a dangerous mistake.
I think it's in our interest
to reassure them.
It seems they're
very influential in England.
Connie, don't forget
we've come to Rome...
to take part in a moment of history.
I remember your husband
very well.
- A true gentleman.
- Indeed.
Lady Hester Random.
- Please.
- Her grandson, Wilfred Random.
Sit down.
Miss Constance Raynor
of the Morning Post.
- Welcome.
- Please.
Dear ladies and gentleman...
Count Grandi tells me
you have some fears...
about your position here in Italy?
To speak truth,
we have been a little nervous.
Have no fears.
I always knew
we could rely on you.
Our long personal relationship
since that night...
with my late husband
at La Scala, Milan.
You don't mind if I take notes?
You are here for that reason,
are you not?
Throughout our glorious history...
we have received your poets.
I have particular regard
for Lord Byron...
the great Lord Byron.
So many of you came here,
that at one time...
the Italian word for foreigner
was " Inglese."
As I was saying,
you have nothing to fear.
Whatever happens...
you will be always...
under my personal protection.
You have my word.
Oh, oh, look.
Shall I be mother?
Shall I pour?
What is it?
What is it?
Look, in the paper.
Good heavens. It's Lady Hester
and himself. They did it.
- They had tea with--
- Mussolini!
Careful.
No food or drink
allowed in the Uffizi anymore.
- We always make tea here.
- There is a change of policy.
Go and drink your tea
in one of your colonies.
This is a free
and civilized country.
No, no, not that one!
Please!
How can you
let them do that?
Nickie, Nickie!
Let me kill him!
Wait for me!
I've seen what
is happening here.
You're afraid to have
an Englishwoman working for you...
in case the Fascists
break up your shop.
I quite understand.
I won't be coming back.
I'm sorry.
It is not just the letters.
It's the boy.
He's doing very well
at school.
His English is first-class.
English is no longer
the language of tomorrow.
Luca must learn German.
I'll send him to school
in Austria.
- Austria?
- Our future is with Germany.
I'm afraid, Miss Wallace...
the era of England--
it's finished.
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.
Now, set the teeth...
and stretch the nostrils wide.
Hold hard the breath. And bend up
every spirit to his full height.
On, on, you noblest Luca.
- Who said that?
- Shakespeare's King Henry.
Remember, before the battle?
- He didn't say " Luca."
- No, he didn't. You're quite right.
He said " English," but he was
talking about people who are brave...
like you.
Case.
Austria is so beautiful.
Snowy mountains, blue skies.
I wish I could come with you.
You're not supposed
to do that.
Bye, Luca.
Look, I brought you some flowers.
Say good-bye to Nickie.
Your favorite biscuits.
Take care.
" And gentlemen in England
now abed...
Shall think themselves accursed
they were not here...
and hold their manhoods cheap
whilst any speak...
that fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's Day.
Upon Saint Crispin's Day!"
Ladies, please, please.
Ladies, please, please.
If I have told you once,
I have told you a hundred times:
You have got to go back
to England.
It's becoming dangerous here.
It's much more dangerous
in England. They're at war.
Why should we change our lives simply
because some idiots want to make war?
The war can't last
more than two weeks.
I mean, aren't the Germans in Paris?
It's all over in France.
For some people,
it's just beginning--
the Jews, for instance.
Thousands of them being
rounded up and taken away.
Everybody's talking about the Jews.
You don't believe every bit
of pink propaganda...
you read in the newspapers, do you?
You can think what you will,
Lady Hester, but I must warn you...
that if Italy declares war...
we shall have to close down
the consulate.
I insist you all return to England.
But whatever for? Signor Mussolini is
wise enough to keep Italy out of it.
- Besides...
- Well said.
I have his personal assurance
that we will not be involved in any way.
Yes, that's all
very well for you ladies.
What about this young man?
Do you want him to become a deserter?
Wilfred will always do
the right thing.
Anna, Anna, yes,
some more tea cakes, please.
Nothing has changed here.
How many memories.
Where's Mary?
Miss Wallace?
We haven't seen her for some time.
She had no more work
and went to stay with a friend.
Which friend?
I don't know.
She didn't leave an address.
She must be
with some other English people.
She's still in Florence?
I don't know. Nobody's seen her.
John Webster!
No, no, three cases. Three.
- Please, are you English?
- Yes.
I'm looking for someone.
Mary Wallace. Do you know her?
- No, she--
- We must get a move on.
I can see Witham.
He's getting everyone on board.
- Is she with your group?
- No, she's one of the die-hards.
She's up at Lady--
Hester's place, refusing to budge.
Sorry.
Witham! Witham!
What's going on here?
The English get bored with Florence...
now they're all heading back
for the excitement of Bournemouth?
It's the war.
- Italy's not in the war.
- Not yet.
Il Duce is waiting
to back the winner.
I'm not leaving.
I'm just arriving.
I'm American.
What about Lady Hester and the others?
They refuse to budge. They still think
Mussolini's going to look after them.
Thank God. What would Florence be
without the " Scorpioni."
- Let's hope the Florentines think so.
- It was lovely to see you.
Good-bye.
I have already been through
this documenti nonsense. Here.
Elsa Strauss- Almerson.
Yes, thank you.
Is that good enough?
- And what happened to the last one?
- He kicked the bucket.
- And who is Strauss-Almerson?
- He is a lovely elderly gentleman.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
No, really, he is.
No, he's an absolute angel.
Or he soon will be.
Signora Elsa!
I'm Luca--
Luca Innocenti.
Luca! My God, every time I see you,
you're taller and more grown-up.
- You're so handsome too.
- I don't think so.
Oh, come on now. When a girl tells
you that, you've got to listen.
Otherwise you're gonna miss out
on a whole bunch of fun.
Let me fill you in on the girls. What
have you been up to? It's been so long.
I was sent away to school in Austria,
but I couldn't bear it any longer...
so I've come home to Florence
to the School of Art.
It's what I've always
wanted to do.
I thought your father always wanted you
to be the perfect English gentleman.
He changed his mind and tried to make me
the perfect German businessman.
- Bet it didn't take.
- It doesn't matter. I'm independent.
- And I owe it all to you, signora.
- To me?
- The money, Elsa. The trust.
- Oh, the trust.
But, Luca, that was
your mother's money.
Now, I'm gonna be here
for a very long time...
and I want you to come up and
tell me all about yourself, okay?
Elsa, darling, is not the moment.
Shall we go, please?
Luca, I have to go,
but I love you. Good-bye!
- Why are you hurrying me so much?
- I tell you later.
This is Vittorio Fanfani. He is
a good lawyer and a good friend.
You know lawyers.
Better to be friends with them.
- Cesee, where's my car?
- It's too big and flashy.
I thought it would be
better to be discreet.
Cesare, I had no idea that driving
around in my car was indiscreet.
- Oh, Elsa, please.
- Well, of course, how would I know...
because I'm just
a rich, vulgar American.
Elsa, my angel, let's talk
about something pleasant.
I have managed
to get the Picasso for you.
- Are you happy?
- So happy, Cesee.
What a great coming-home present.
It's a very beautiful painting.
- You know something about modern art?
- Yes.
I like it very much,
especially the Italian--
Marinetti, Balla, de Chirico.
Beauty and brains.
So, you're a chauffeur
who's a lawyer...
and an art expert
and speaks English.
Cesee, things have changed.
So how is it that you speak
such perfect English?
My father. I spent some time with him
in America when he was working there.
Wonderful country.
Would you like to go back?
- If this war doesn't spoil everything.
- Exactly, Elsa.
Would someone correct me if I'm wrong?
Am I living on a completely
different planet?
As far as I know, the United States
isn't at war with anybody.
Not yet, anyway.
Mister, l--
Fanfani, Vittorio.
Vittorio, I was thinking that since
you're such a lover of modern art...
that it would be nice if you could come
up and help me when I hang my paintings.
I'd like that very much.
Cesare showed me some of your art.
- That Balla you have is my favorite.
- I know, it's mine too.
- Really?
- Yes.
This conversation is making me
a little carsick.
- Are you ready? We have to go.
- Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I holding up the war?
-Are we under arrest?
-He says we're being taken into custody.
Oh, really?
It will be nice to know
that when we're locked up...
we won't be under arrest,
just " taken into custody."
- And what will II Duce do?
- Il Duce?
Yes, II Duce. What will he do
when he hears that you've arrested me?
You see,
I am Lady Hester Random.
My late husband was
His Britannic Majesty's ambassador.
I have diplomatic immunity.
- More coffee, please. This is cold.
- Oh, Hester.
Anna, are you crazy?
You can't go with them.
Try to understand.
Lady Hester took care of me
when nobody else would.
I can't leave her now!
Listen to me!
Leave me alone!
What did he say?
- That we are enemy aliens.
- But we are not enemies.
We're not aliens, either.
We chose Florence from the whole world.
Florence should be honored!
For once I agree with you.
Hello, Mary.
- We'd better go, Hester.
- Better go?
I'm sure Mussolini will
release you quite soon.
Yes. I'd better go.
At least you can take
your maid to look after you.
And your niece,
to accompany you.
Georgie, will you
take Lucy to the bus?
Oh, certainly.
Lucy, my dear.
Oh, you look lovely
in your traveling frock.
Oh, I'm very worried for you, with
all these Italian studs roaming around.
Come on. Up you go.
You're gonna miss your trousers.
I never leave home without mine.
Though I must say, skirts
aren't all bad under the right...
situation.
- Hester, Hester, come on. Chin up.
- Oh, that's typically American.
Keep out of trouble and tell
other people to keep their chins up.
Come on. You never know. I may be
joining you sooner than you think.
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?
Take care, old girl.
Oh, dear!
What a dreadful, tiny--
Oh! Oh, heavens!
- I'm sorry.
- Miss Mary, it's me, Luca.
It is you! Oh, my goodness,
I can't believe it!
I heard what they were
doing to you.
I'm afraid it's " hello" and " good-bye"
all in the same breath. l--
I'll let you know
where we're going, if I can.
You waited! You waited!
We came as quickly as we could.
We have to find room for these.
I can't go without my paints.
Here.
Come on, Nickie.
Come quickly.
You won't take the dog!
Don't take her!
Please, don't take her!
My dog!
I have to have--
Take the dog, please.
Look after her.
Of course I will.
We were puppies together.
Bye!
So that's where they're taking them...
San Gimignano...
the city of one hundred towers.
Have you ever been there?
There are some beautiful
frescoes by Ghirlandaio.
Beautiful.
That'll be a great comfort
for those wretched ladies.
Well, this can't be right.
This is a barracks!
It looks like an old school.
Well, there must be a mistake.
It seems there's
only one lavatory.
We can't be expected to sleep together.
Are we to have no privacy?
Now, if we have to be here,
we may as well make the best of it.
So why don't you all choose
a bed and take your cases...
and we'll rig up some screens
for a bit of privacy.
Let's do a roll call before
the old ladies go to sleep.
You are extremely rude,
young man!
No gentleman would dream of entering
a lady's room without first knocking.
Now go outside, count to ten,
and then knock.
When you hear me say,
"come in," you may enter.
Oh, Mary, translate that
for me, please.
Now, outside, please!
And it is customary, when leaving
a lady's room, to say " good night."
Did you hear what I said?
"Good night."
Oh, Mary. Let's teach them
a little basic English.
" Good night." Now, come on.
It's not difficult.
" Good night."
- Good night.
- Good night.
" Ladies."
- Ladies.
- Now, come on.
- " Good night, ladies."
- Good night, ladies.
Now go.
" Good night, ladies."
She's come all this way!
Oh, you brilliant dog!
You brilliant dog!
I thought you'd be here.
Come on. Let's sit down
for a moment.
Do you know, I was so worried
after you went away.
I never knew
what happened to you.
I did write to you from
that Nazi school. I promise I did.
- Perhaps they didn't post my letters.
- Oh, I'm sure they didn't.
" The English are the enemy,"
they said, over and over again.
But you're not
the enemy, Mary.
I'm afraid, in Italy now...
I am the enemy, Luca.
So you must be very careful.
It could be quite dangerous
for you to come here often.
- But I can help you. There's the trust.
- What?
The money Elsa gave me--
I can give it to you.
I don't want you to do that.
That is your future.
But thank you.
It's nice to know that
someone is looking after us.
I told you-- Wait.
Stop cleaning those glasses.
- Up, one on top of another.
- I think it is very difficult.
A pyramid. That's when--
She's crazy...
completely crazy.
What have you done to her?
Elsa is in love!
Unbelievable!
You should get her
to buy my Modigliani.
It is a bargain.
Everyone is selling up nowadays.
Have you see how many pictures
and sculptures she's bought already?
I'm trying to calm her down, Sam--
put some order into her life.
- Don't even show it to her.
- Pity. Then I'll take it to New York.
Oh, thank you.
You're leaving?
I certainly am.
I have sold the gallery.
I'm joining the general stampede,
I'm afraid.
- Europe just isn't home anymore.
- My dear Sam, why ever not?
Accident of birth, I suppose.
It is never a good time to be a Jew.
Vittorio is right.
Elsa must stop this folly.
Send the collection to Switzerland.
Get out fast.
All right, come on.
Don't open your eyes.
We're almost there.
Don't open your eyes.
You can open your eyes!
Isn't it unbelievable?
Isn't this fabulous?
You should have seen this house
before I fixed it.
Isn't this amazing?
This is Picasso.
It's one of his most famous paintings.
It's called
Desmoiselles d'Avignon.
I almost lost this painting once.
But, you know, I really want something,
I don't give up till I get it.
De Chirico.
Frightens the hell out of you,
doesn't it?
- Luca, can you do me a little favor?
- A favor? Of course.
Now, you gotta be responsible.
I have to be able to trust you.
I'll be responsible.
This is my favorite. Balla--
another great Italian.
An explosion
of color and light.
Makes you feel.
Makes you think.
And I spend my time
learning how to draw the past.
Oh, no!
You have to study the classics.
It's essential that you know the basics
before you go off and experiment.
- Like Picasso.
- Exactly.
I can trust you.
Come on.
Come on!
Close the door.
And take off your shirt.
Come on, Luca. Unbutton your shirt.
I don't have all day.
Here.
-Does anybody take care of your clothes?
-I live alone.
Luca, I need you to deliver
this package for me tonight.
These are
very important documents.
It's imperative that
no one find out about it.
So, here.
This is the address.
Memorize it, and then burn it.
Maybe with your baby face
no one will suspect.
Meet me tomorrow
at Doney's at 12:00.
Didn't you hear the alarm?
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a shelter.
I can't find one.
Show me your documents.
Go home to your mother. Run!
The passports.
You cannot believe
the good you've done.
This is gonna make
so many people happy.
Have you ever had
champagne before?
To the old Scorpioni
in San Gimignano.
And let's see if we can cheer them up,
but it's got to be our secret.
Now, after your next mission...
what would you think
about dinner at the villa?
I think I can rustle up a chicken.
We can talk about painting--
Thursday night, 9:00.
I think I might be free.
Oh, you think
you might be free.
Cigarettes, champagne,
"I think I might be free--"
Are we a man now?
- Possibly.
- And such a handsome man.
Orders from II Duce.
From whom?
II Duce.
Top secret.
Not a word to anyone...
especially the police.
Just call the bank, understand?
I understand. The bank.
Can you believe it?
We're going to be moved to a hotel!
Of course. Il Duce must have found out
some stupid underling made a mistake.
Amazing. You'd think Musso
would have other things on his mind--
like the war,
for instance.
Once upon a time this hotel had
a very high standard of service.
I stayed here with my late husband,
the ambassador.
My dear Lady Hester!
Count Piero Bernardini.
A million apologies for not coming
to pay my respects earlier, but--
I had the honor
of knowing your husband.
I don't remember him ever
having mentioned your name.
In Rome.
Excuse me. Do you
know the manager here?
Menotti, Menotti.
Lady Hester.
You'll be having a good spring clean,
I hope. Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Menotti...
we take afternoon tea at 4:00.
When I say 4:00, I mean 4:00.
Not a quarter past, 4:00.
Would you please put this
in a prominent position?
The story of the ladies--
I don't understand you sometimes.
What makes you do it?
It's going to cost you a fortune!
It's the way I am.
Sometimes I do crazy things.
But they hate you!
They've always been mean to you.
I know, but they're old, amore.
And-- I don't know.
I respect them.
And who's gonna take care
of them? Mussolini?
- " I respect them."
- I don't want to talk about this.
Fine, fine. Everything--
it's easy for you.
Obviously it's pointless
trying to have...
a serious conversation with you.
But it's going to be very difficult
for me to get out of here.
False documents,
bribing people--
- I can take care of it.
- I will take care of myself.
Still...
it might very well be that
I won't be able to go with you.
If you can't go,
then I won't go.
Does that make you
feel better, baby?
You are impossible, Elsa!
Yes, it would make me
very happy...
but it doesn't solve
our problems.
Oh, you Italians!
You're so dramatic!
Problems, problems.
My biggest problem is what
am I gonna wear tonight?
- Signora Elsa?
- Mrs. Strauss-Almerson is not at home.
Not at home?
But she invited me to dinner.
" Come to dinner
at the villa," she said.
" On Thursday."
Today is Thursday, isn't it?
As I said,
Mrs. Strauss-Almerson is not at home.
Would you care
to leave a message?
Give her these.
- What about pearls?
- Pearls is all right.
But small ones, please.
- Black ones or white ones?
- What?
Black ones or white ones?
Whatever you want, as long as you
don't wear too many jewels, as usual.
Thank you, darling.
Lady, niente animale qui in duomo.
Nonsense. You can't proibito dogs.
They've got souls, just like us.
Which pope was it that said that dogs
have souls too? You ought to know.
You work in a cathedral.
You know nothing about dogs' souls.
I told you, no dogs are allowed
in the cathedral. Don't you understand?
Oh, never mind.
The light's fading anyway.
But we'll be back tomorrow.
Won't we?
You can come here
whenever you like...
but you must leave your dog outside.
What kind of a Christian are you?
You go on about one of God's creatures,
yet let these frescoes fall to pieces!
Shame on you!
These are the documents Lady Hester
asked me to fetch from her villa.
Thank you. Have you seen
anything of Elsa? How is she?
How should I know?
I'm only the messenger boy.
What's the matter?
It's just, I don't want to be her
messenger boy any longer. That's all.
Luca, wait!
What on Earth has happened?
She's always been so good to you.
She's a rich lady. She can afford
to be good to everybody...
including all of you.
What are you talking about?
Who do you think is paying
your hotel bills? Mussolini?
What do you mean?
- It's Elsa!
- Elsa?
Yes, Elsa.
- Why, how very generous of her.
- Anyway, she has someone else.
He can be her postman now.
Ah. The green-eyed monster.
- Come on.
- All right!
- Wonderful!
- You marry me?
We interrupt our broadcast
for a special communiqué.
At dawn this morning,
the Japanese Air Force...
attacked the US Naval Base
at Pearl Harbor.
- What are they saying?
- Something about the Americans.
The loss of human life is thought
to have been extremely heavy.
Terrible loss of life.
President Roosevelt has called an
emergency session of the US Congress...
to declare war on Japan,
Germany and Italy.
They're in the war.
The Americans are in the war!
America is our enemy?
What will happen to my sister
and her family in Brooklyn?
Will they arrest all of them?
- Georgie, darling!
- You'll never believe how I missed you.
Hon-- Ursula!
Oh, I wish this hadn't
happened to you. I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey, don't be.
Now we can all be enemy aliens together.
- We'll make it a party!
- This isn't going to be a party.
I am sorry you've been separated
from your dance partners.
Now you're about to find out
what it's like to be at war.
Well, this isn't exactly
the trenches, is it, Hester?
Thanks to the generosity of II Duce,
we are being treated with dignity.
Whether he wishes
to extend his generosity...
to American citizens
is quite another matter.
Come on, gals. We don't need
to fight. We've got to live together.
That means behaving
like gentlemen. Right, Lucy?
I can't take this much longer.
I'm 22. Nobody seems
to remember that.
She thinks I'm still a child.
- She's doing it to save your life.
- What life?
How much longer do I have to stay here,
wasting my life like a fool?
It was the only thing
she could think of to do.
People will do anything
for someone they love.
Making me live like this--
you call that love?
Yes. Yes, it is love.
Whatever it may seem to you,
it is love!
I...
I lost the two men
I loved the most in a war.
But I wasn't given a choice.
If I were in Hester's place...
I might do the same as she.
Whatever you want.
Send her something warm.
You know what she'll need.
They haven't even given her time
to take a handkerchief.
She left a letter for you.
The Swiss consul will come
this afternoon with some experts.
They might be in
for some big surprises.
Like that fake Picasso
and those Legers.
Anyway, fake or real...
they must know that the pictures
belong to a foreign company.
Elsa doesn't own anything.
Officially!
Not even the villa or the rest.
She never talked to me about it.
She always signed everything herself.
Elsa's crazy but not to the point...
of refusing to protect herself
from potential problems.
And it was you who advised her
how to avoid these problems?
Not me, my law firm.
Elsa, we've been invited
to a party on New Year's Eve!
- And you've been invited too!
- At Count Bernardini's palazzo.
Elsa, darling, you wouldn't have
a pair of stockings, would you?
- I don't know.
- May we look in your luggage?
Yes, yes. Go ahead.
You're a darling!
Oh, Elsa, Elsa,
please may I have this?
- Yes, Hazel. It's you. You keep it.
- Thank you!
- Do you think it suits me?
- Yes, Molly.
Oh, my God!
Does my butler think I'm wintering
in Monte Carlo, for God's sake?
Silk stockings!
Oh, I don't believe it!
You can feel them!
Wonderful!
Feel the silk!
Would you like some?
Oh, grazie, Luca.
Thank you.
Signor Innocenti.
Good evening, signora.
Luca, stop this nonsense.
You know you're gonna
forgive me in the end anyway.
All right, so I am a dizzy dame
with the memory of a fruit fly...
but I love you, and I would
never do anything to hurt you, ever.
Look at them.
Look how adorable they look.
Do you know how happy it would
make your mother to know the joy...
that she's brought a bunch
of old crazy English ladies?
I think they look better on them
than they did on me.
Dance with me.
Come on.
Please dance with me, Luca.
Come on, now.
It's not that awful.
Lady Hester, ma'am...
may I have the pleasure
of dancin' with Miss Lucy?
- Oh, Georgie--
- Come on, gal.
Goodness' sake!
Oh, Georgie, don't.
I really don't-- Georgie!
Hi.
- You look lovely. I love that dress.
- Thank you.
Actually, I love that dress.
That's my favorite dress.
Okay, enough of this flirting.
I don't like you behaving this way
when you're out with me.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Miss Elsa,
you look wonderful.
How could I not come
to kiss you on New Year's Eve?
Listen, I have some
very important news.
Come this way.
Get ready.
You're going to Switzerland.
But how can I get
to Switzerland?
There. A diplomatic passport.
But listen carefully. We can't
travel together. It's too dangerous.
You'll go first. I'll cross
the border with a Dutch passport.
In a few days, we'll be
together again in Zurich.
All I need you to do is sign
the last of the company papers.
- There.
- Yes.
- Don't be afraid.
- No.
- And there.
- Yes.
Everything will be fine.
Now I must go. I have many details
to attend to and Mama's waiting.
- Listen. Everything will be fine.
- I know, but--
- It's a matter of days.
- How will I know? Who will contact me?
Somebody will contact you.
Trust me.
And remember:
I am doing all of this for us...
so we can be together, in America.
When we remember the cruelties...
with which the German armies
are now afflicting almost all Europe...
when we read every week
of the mass executions of Poles...
Norwegians, Dutchmen, Belgians,
Czechoslovakians, Frenchmen...
- Yugoslavs and Greeks...
- What's happened? What did he say?
when we see these ancient
and honored countries...
whose deeds and traditions
Europe is the heir...
when we see them writhing under
this hateful and merciless alien yoke...
when we see their patriots
striking back with every week...
a fiercer and more furious
desperation--
when we see all that,
we may feel sure...
that we bear the sword of justice.
And we are resolved
to use that sword...
with the utmost severity
to the full and to the end.
- Wilfred!
- Nice.
- Wilfred!
- Lucy--
- I'm not Lucy!
- Lucy--
- Lucy--
- I'm not Lucy! I'm Wilfred!
You are wonderful
without your hair.
I'm a man. I'm a man!
I'm a man!
I'm a man! I'm a man!
- I'm a--
- Wilfred!
Did you know Professor Cassuto
was a Jew?
Where are they taking him?
Wherever they take him...
we'll never see him again.
We are here, we are here
Ghirlandaio, Ghirlandaio
We are here, we are here
- Santa Fina, we are here
- We must hurry. That's right.
Let's put it down here.
- Keep the music going!
- Come on. Come on!
Georgie, Georgie!
Wait, wait! Look!
Shouldn't we have some canvas to protect
her? Mattresses, something like that.
It's fine. It's good. As long as
it's not touching, don't worry.
Well, you do it.
I'm much too nervous.
Get some wine,
and bring me some.
- This is better than Earl Grey!
- I can't bear to watch that.
It's made me so nervous.
Give me a drink.
I'm terribly worried.
I've heard nothing more from Wilfred.
- Luca gave you the message. He's safe.
- Yes, I know--
- Safe? With those terrorists?
- He's fighting for freedom.
You said Wilfred always did the
right thing. You should be proud of him.
I am, I am.
But he'd be safer here with me.
You can't keep him wrapped up forever.
He's fine now. Think of him.
Well, haven't I been?
Perhaps you've been thinking more about
yourself. Do you mind my saying that?
Yes, of course I do.
Oh, I hope she's all right.
Sleep well, Santa Fina,
until it's safe to wake you up.
Santa Fina, Santa Fina
We are here, we are here
Yes. Yes, it's true.
Vittorio had so many arrested.
Some I knew very well.
Old friends--
they never returned!
But if he didn't really love Elsa,
why didn't he have her arrested before?
Because he had other plans.
He controls everything she owns.
¡He'll take it all! That's why
Elsa has to die. You understand?
Yes, it's true.
Oh, please. Please.
I love Elsa.
She is a great friend.
I feel responsible.
I understood it all too late.
We'll do everything we can.
SYou knew all this.
You didn't tell Elsa or me?
You'd have accused me
of being jealous.
Jealous? Luca,
what were you thinking of?
What does it matter
about your hurt feelings...
when you know someone's life
is in danger?
Someone who's given so much
and made everything possible for you?
Oh, how could you be
so childish?
So ungrateful?
It's time to grow up, Luca.
We all have to grow up sometime.
Luca! Luca, how are you?
It isn't easy--
but we've saved other Jews before.
Unfortunately, there's
a problem with money.
A lot of people are
risking their lives.
What have you done--
robbed a bank?
Hurry up!
I say, Luca.
I didn't know you were so rich.
No, I'm not.
That's not my money.
It was meant to help me grow up.
But it doesn't seem to have worked.
Well, what's happened?
Once upon a time, my father wanted me
to be a perfect English gentleman.
But I forgot the first rule:
" Love thyself last."
- Shakespeare.
- Who else?
Mary wants us to help
Mrs. Strauss-Almerson escape.
I don't see why
we should be involved.
She's got a passport. She's got papers
all provided by her Italian friend.
- Passport-- it's a death warrant.
- How can we be sure of that?
- She can make her own arrangements.
- She's too damn scared to move.
Oh, well, if she can't move,
she better stay where she is.
- What have you got against Elsa?
- Nothing in particular.
Oh, yes, you have.
She's American.
And she's a Jew.
It isn't that.
She's a flagrantly immoral woman.
Oh, Hester, come off it. She's not the
only one. Some people in this room...
have been having it with every pair
of pants in sight, civil and military.
- Not yours, thank God.
- Oh, I second that.
I experience life, and I owe it
to my talent as a writer.
As a matter of fact, I have
an announcement. I'm writing a book:
my memoirs,
Letters from San Gimignano.
- Another Lady Chatterly.
- Rescuing Elsa...
would be a wonderful story
for my book.
Story? This is not a story.
We could all get shot!
Shot! I've got
the frescoes to save!
Arabella, you might love art...
but art certainly doesn't
respond to your affections.
- Lady Hester, please!
- No, perhaps she's right.
Perhaps I'm no good.
Maybe I can't paint
the way I would like to...
but nor could
Ghirlandaio or Titian.
I mean, look at Schubert--
he never even finished that symphony.
All artists fail,
and perhaps I've failed more than most.
More than others. But since
I've been in this beautiful place...
I feel that there is
more that I can do...
that there is a way
of making people understand, that l--
- Oh, God!
- Arabella, just please don't start.
- Perhaps we should stop quarrelling.
- I'm enjoying it, aren't you?
I'm not quarrelling, I'm simply asking
why we should risk our lives for hers.
Because she is
in terrible danger.
She's just waiting there.
She's put her trust in a man who has
no intention of helping her to escape.
She signed over
all her property to him...
and now he's planning
to get rid of her.
Luca and I have tried to tell her.
She won't listen to a word against him.
So she's waiting there
for Vittorio...
and what will be coming
is the Gestapo.
Oh, Hester,
you've got to tell her to go.
Luca and his friends
have everything ready.
But why me? She doesn't like me.
I certainly don't like her.
- That's exactly why.
- And because you owe it to her.
I don't owe that woman anything.
Do you really believe Mussolini
has been paying these hotel bills?
Yes. Of course--
Who else?
Stop living in
a fantasy world, Hester.
Mussolini doesn't give a damn
about you or any of us.
It's Elsa
who has paid the bills...
and never once
asked to be thanked.
Ask Luca.
He arranged everything.
Luca, is this true?
Yes, Lady Hester.
Elsa? It's Lady Hester.
- Open this door. I must speak with you.
- Go away.
I have a message
from Vittorio.
Aren't you rather
letting yourself go?
Give me the goddamn
message, Hester.
His message is perfectly clear.
Mary tells me you've signed
everything over to him.
- All your property?
- Yes.
- And all your money?
- Yes.
Well, now he has everything you possess,
he wants you arrested and probably dead.
He won't be coming here.
He's keeping well away.
He's leaving everything to the Gestapo.
But I have a passport.
EThe passport is worth nothing.
Georgie says it's a death warrant.
I'm scared.
Yes, well, yes,
of course you are. We all are.
Luca will help you,
he and his friends.
My grandson's with them.
They will help you out of Italy.
You must get ready, please.
What do you want to take?
- I don't-- This.
- All right.
Why are you helping me?
You always hated me.
Because we're creatures
from two different worlds, you and I.
Because I have despised you,
and you have laughed at me.
The " Scorpioni."
And because,
in spite of all that...
you've been very kind to us
and kept it a secret.
And because we've both been
very foolish women.
We've both trusted men
who have turned out to be bastards.
- Vittorio.
- And Mussolini.
Come on, come.
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- Absolutely.
- Oh, you look so great in trousers.
- Thank you.
- I've just been with your grandmother.
- How is she?
She's wonderful, and she's so proud
of you, and I'm proud of you too.
Come on, come on.
- Remain here until the boat comes.
- Okay.
Come here. I don't know how much time
we have. I wanna tell you something.
I remember when your mother
was in trouble.
- My mother?
- Yes, you were the trouble.
- Me?
- Yes.
Your mother was pregnant. We knew your
dad was a liar and wouldn't marry her.
So none of her friends wanted her
to go through with it.
I want you to know something:
She really wanted you.
And so I said,
"Don't listen to them. They're idiots.
Just follow your heart,
and if you want him, have him."
So, if I hadn't been there for you then,
you wouldn't be here for me now.
I wish you didn't have to go.
I wish I didn't have to go either.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I'll always remember you.
When I come back, and you've got
a beautiful wife and a bunch of kids...
you won't remember me.
I'll still never forget you.
Well, yeah,
I am very unforgettable.
But don't tell her that. You know women
get their feelings hurt so easily.
- The boat's here. It's time to go.
- Okay, okay.
There's a boat waiting to meet you about
a mile out that will take you to safety.
Good luck.
Are you Americans?
- Are you English?
- No!
We're not bloody
English, laddie.
We're bloody Scots.
They're not gonna blow up the towers?
No, we can't let them do that.
No, no! Let go of me! No!
Milady, milady, milady.
The lady with the dog.
She's tied herself
to one of the towers.
You have got five seconds
to get out of here. You understand?
Five seconds
to get away from here.
- Stop!
- One, two--
- Stop!
- Three--
Stop this nonsense at once!
You have no right to blow up these.
You have no right at all!
- Do you understand me?
- Get out of here, you old fools!
We are not old fools! You guard
that one. I'll go there. Come on.
Get out! Just you imagine what a hero
you'll be blowing up old ladies!
They'll give you
the Iron Cross for that!
Shut up, you old fool!
In Berlin!
- No interpreter is needed for this job.
- Which job, sir?
A party of English ladies.
Old biddies...
under some sort of arrest
here in San Gimignano.
Orders are to move them to
a place of safety-- down to Rome.
Actually, I think you might
need an interpreter, sir.
- Why? Do you know them, Innocenti?
- Very well, sir.
- Do they not understand plain English?
- Yes...
but they don't understand orders.
Well, we'll see about that.
Now, ladies...
we've laid on transport
for 0900 hours.
- Collect your things. We'll move--
- Move? Who says?
- I do. I have orders.
- Orders!
My good man,
I'm Lady Hester Random.
My late husband was His Britannic
Majesty's Ambassador.
See, I have,
as you may imagine...
a very special position here.
So will you excuse me, please?
Ladies, ladies, I must insist.
This is still the front line!
If you'll please go to the waiting
transport, we really must get moving.
Do be quiet,
Major whoever you are.
The Germans and the Italians
couldn't get rid of us.
There is absolutely no reason
why we should surrender to the Scots.
Miss Mary.
I thought we weren't
supposed to do that.
Let me look at you.
Oh, you look splendid.
The perfect
English gentleman.
Just what your father wanted.
Georgie, give me a hand.
Is she all right?
Is she all right?
Shh, let her sleep.
