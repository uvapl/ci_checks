My father
hated lawyers all his life.
He wasn't a great guy,
my old man.
He drank
and beat up my mother.
He beat me up, too.
So you might think
I became a lawyer
just to piss him off,
but you'd be wrong.
I've wanted to be a lawyer
ever since I read about
the civil rights lawyers
in the fifties and sixties
and the amazing uses
they found for the law.
They did what a lot
of people thought
was the impossible.
They gave lawyers
a good name.
And so I went
to law school,
and it did
piss my father off,
but he was pissed off
anyway.
In my first year,
he got drunk one day
and fell of a ladder
manufactured by the company
he worked for,
and he didn't know
who to sue first.
Now, he died a couple
months after that.
I'm empty.
Now, some
of my classmates,
they knew they were going
straight from school
into the top law firms,
thanks mostly to their
family connections.
Now, the only
connections I had
were made in the places
where I tended bar for 3 years
so I could pay my tuition.
And while I still had plans
to shine the blazing
light of justice
into every dark corner,
what I really needed
right now was a job,
and badly,
because there are too many
lawyers in Memphis.
This city's
infested with them.
I don't think so.
I can't think of
anything more embarrassing
than telling people
I work for a guy
like Bruiser Stone.
I mean, he's a lawyer,
and they call him Bruiser.
That's how desperate I am.
Sure.
Shut the door.
No, not that.
Not that either.
Sure.
Sure.
Let's make it my house.
OK.
I really pity
the poor FBI technician
that's gonna
have to extract the data
from that conversation.
Live sharks in
a lawyer's office.
It's a joke.
Get it?
So, Prince,
is this the law student
you were telling me about?
Yes, sir.
I just finished
my third year
at Memphis state.
Couldn't you use him
around here?
Look, I'll vouch for him.
The boy needs a job.
He's tended bar
at our clubs.
This'll be a great place
for you to work, Rudy.
This'll be...
A great place
for you to work.
You can see what
real lawyers do.
Now, it ain't exactly
a salaried position.
It isn't?
I expect my associates
to pay for themselves--
generate their own fees.
Talk to me.
How exactly
does that work?
Well, Rudy,
you draw $1,000 a month,
and you get to keep 1/3 of all
the fees that you generate.
Now, if you can't
cover your draw
at the end of each month,
you owe me the balance.
Do you understand?
Sounds fair to me,
Rudy.
That's a hell
of a deal, really.
You can make a lot
of money this way.
Um...
I'll tell you
something, Rudy.
That's the only way
I operate.
And I'll get you
a lot of good cases.
I have cases.
Uh...
I have 2 cases
right now.
One is a will
that I'm drafting
for an old woman.
She's loaded, too.
She's worth millions.
And then I have
this other case.
It's an insurance case.
Great Benefit.
You heard of 'em.
You got these clients signed?
I'm on my way
to see 'em right now,
and they'll listen
to me, too.
I helped 'em
over at a law workshop.
All right,
I'm gonna have you talk
to an associate of mine,
Deck Schifflet.
He used to work with these
big insurance companies.
He handles all the high-powered
stuff around here.
Hey, deck!
Deck!
Damn it.
You got the paperwork
on this stuff?
In my car.
Good.
Hey, good lookin'
this is Deck Schifflet.
This man will get you
plugged in.
What I want you to do,
I want you to draw up a lawsuit
against this Great Benefit,
and you put my name on it.
We're gonna file it today.
Thank you.
Rudy, you're gonna
learn a lot.
Rudy, I'm glad
you came here.
You're making good
choices already, son.
All right,
well, thank you.
OK, thank you.
Close the door on your
way out now, OK?
Law offices.
May I help you?
This is an office,
there's people in it.
If there's somebody
in the office,
you can't have it,
it's off limits.
This is the bathroom.
Just a minute.
Sorry.
So, are you
an associate here?
Sort of. Not really.
I'm actually
not a lawyer yet.
Bruiser usually asks me
to review the insurance cases
when they come in.
I used to work for specific
mutual insurance company.
I got sick of that.
I went to law school.
Well, when did you
finish law school?
5 years ago.
See, I'm having
a little trouble
with the bar exam.
I sat for it 6 times.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah. When do you
take yours?
I take it
in, like, 3 weeks.
Oh, yeah.
It's that hard?
Pretty rough,
I'll say.
I took it a year ago.
I don't think I'm gonna
take it again.
Anyway, this is
Bruiser's law library.
If you want
to get anything
out of the fridge
or use the fridge,
you can put
your name on stuff.
They'll eat it anyway.
Put that in for me.
Aw, it's only rice.
What the hell. Daisy.
Yeah.
We made a mess here.
Get that up, huh?
Sure, deck.
Anyway...
So wait, what happens
when you have to go to court?
I've actually gone
a few times myself.
I haven't
gotten caught.
There's so many
lawyers here,
it's impossible
to keep up with us.
Bruiser owns all this.
Oh. Nice.
You can't call it
a firm exactly.
It's every man
for himself.
You'll learn.
What, are you moving?
Evicted.
Here's the policy.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Well, this is
the scratch-and-sniff armpit
of the industry.
What are their grounds
for denial?
Oh, well, everything.
They first denied it
just on principle,
and then they said
that leukemia
was a pre-existing
condition,
and then they said
leukemia wasn't covered
in the policy.
I got 7 letters here.
Have all the premiums
been paid?
According to Miss Black,
she paid every
single one of them.
The bastards.
This is a typical
debit insurance scam.
The Blacks call it
street-surance.
So what do I do?
You sign 'em up.
Sign 'em all up.
To J. Lyman Stone.
All right.
Yeah. I'll help you
on this one.
All right.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
There's nothing
more thrilling
than nailing
an insurance company.
Hi, Ms. Black.
It's Rudy Baylor.
Remember?
I'm handling your case
against Great Benefit.
I met you
over at the Memphis
state law workshop.
Well, come in.
Come in. I'm sorry
about them crazy dogs.
Oh, that's OK.
I thought you was
a Jehovah’s witness.
Where's Buddy?
He's out in the car.
Where's he going?
Buddy isn't going
nowhere.
He ain't right
in the head. War injury.
Korea. You know
them metal detectors
at the airport?
He can walk through one
buck naked,
and the thing
would go off.
He's got a plate
in his head.
Oh.
That's awful.
How's Donny Ray?
Well, good days and bad.
"Plate in head."
You want to meet him?
Maybe later.
Um, now...
Great Benefit first denied
your claim last August
when Donny Ray was diagnosed.
Why'd y'all wait till now
to consult a lawyer?
Stupid, I guess.
I just kept
writing 'em,
and they kept
writing me back,
and this here
is the latest one.
"Dear Mrs. Black,
"on 7 prior occasions
"this company had denied
your claim in writing.
"We now deny it for the eighth
and final time.
You must be stupid,
stupid, stupid."
"Sincerely, Everett Lufkin,
Vice President of Claims."
I don't
believe this.
You're the lawyer.
Mom says
nice things about you.
She says you're suing
those bastards
over at Great Benefit.
Gonna make 'em pay, huh?
That's right.
That's right.
Hi, mama.
Hi, honey.
Well, before we can
file a claim,
I need all 3 of you
to sign this.
Is daddy coming in?
Well, he said
he wasn't.
Some days
he comes in,
and some days
he don't.
Well, this is a contract.
What's in it?
Oh, the usual.
It's standard language.
It basically says
that y'all hire us
to be your attorneys,
and we take care
of the case for you.
We handle any expenses
that we might have,
and then we get
1/3 of any recovery.
Mm-hmm.
Well, why does it take
2 pages to say all that?
don't light that.
No wonder I'm dying.
And all 3 of us
have to sign it?
Yes, ma'am, all 3.
Just where your name is.
He said he wasn't
coming in.
Take the pen
and go out there
and make him sign
the damn thing.
I guess I could.
Now, Buddy,
you gotta sign
this paper
so Donny Ray can get
that operation he needs,
and I don't want
no trouble out of you.
I'll take
that damn bottle
and throw it
across union street.
Now sign the damn thing.
Come on, hurry up.
I know you must think
they're crazy.
They're nice folks.
Hey, man.
Hey, your nose
is bleeding.
Mrs. Black!
Hold your head up.
Mrs. Black!
It's OK.
I got it.
He's bleeding.
Put your head back.
Put your head back.
Come on,
put it back.
Oh, sweetie, OK,
it'll be all right.
I got it.
I got it.
OK, OK.
OK, I got it.
You're gonna
be all right.
Where's the paper?
Donny Ray, why don't you
just rest a little bit?
You can wait.
You don't have
to do this now.
No, no. I want
to do this now.
OK.
All right, all right,
you can do it.
Go ahead.
You're doing it.
Uh, Miss Birdie,
it's Rudy Baylor.
What?
Who is it?
It's Rudy Baylor.
Oh.
We met
at the law workshop
at Memphis state.
Oh, yes.
Oh, come in, come in.
Thank you, thank you.
How are you doing today?
Fine, fine.
Miss Birdie, I wanted
to talk to you
about your will.
Cut my children out of
my will. Cut, cut, cut.
Cut, cut, cut.
I know.
I had trouble sleeping
last night
'cause I was worried
about your estate.
Now, if you're not careful,
Miss Birdie,
the government is just gonna
get a big chunk of this.
Now, a lot of these taxes
can be avoided
with a little bit
of careful estate planning.
Oh, that legal
gobbledygook.
I suppose
you want your name
in the will
somewhere.
Of course not.
Lawyers are always
wanting their names
in my wills.
No, ma'am. Well, there are
all kinds of lawyers.
What I do need from you is,
for purposes of estate planning,
I do need to know
where the money is.
Is it in bonds
or stocks or cash?
Now, Rudy, not so fast,
not so fast.
OK, ma'am. So we have
this money somewhere.
Who are we gonna
leave it to?
Well,
I want it all to go
to the reverend
Kenneth Chandler.
Do you know him?
He's on television
all the time now
out of Dallas.
Got this curly
gray hair premature,
and he wouldn't
dream
of touching it up,
you know?
I want him
to have the money.
Forgive me,
Miss Birdie. Um...
What?
I just have a real problem
drafting a will
or any instrument
that's gonna cut out family
and that's gonna replace it
and convey
the bulk of this estate
to a TV personality.
Well, he's a man of God.
I realize that.
I know.
Is there any way we could
attack this in more of a--
do you have to give him
everything?
Could it be more,
say, 25%
he's got
a lot of overhead,
and his jet
is getting old.
His jet is getting old?
Now, Rudy, I want you
to just please
draw it up
the way I ask
and bring it back to me
so I can review it,
all right?
Here's the hustlers
when they were still
young and sweet.
Cut, cut, cut.
You come back now, huh?
Oh, I will, I will.
Thank you.
No. Thank you.
Is that a little
apartment back there?
Used to be.
What do you think
about my garden?
Oh, that's
a fine-looking garden.
Do you do all the work
on this yourself?
Most of it.
I pay a young boy to cut
the grass for me once a week.
$30. Can you believe it?
Used to be 5.
Well, I don't suppose
you'd be interested
in renting this place
out now, would you?
I couldn't afford much,
though.
I could let you have it
quite reasonably
if you'd assist me with a few
chores around the place.
Sure, sure.
Perhaps a little weed pulling
now and then.
Sure. Weed pulling's
my specialty.
Go to hospitals
all the time.
Bruiser has contacts
down at the main precinct,
guys he grew up with.
They feed him accident
reports every morning.
Can I ask you
something?
Sure.
What does Bruiser
expect me to do?
Get the case.
You find the victims.
You sign 'em up to the law firm
of J. Lyman Stone.
Put the case together.
So I should solicit?
What did they teach you
in law school?
Well, they didn't
teach me
how to chase
ambulances.
Well, you better learn quick,
or you're gonna starve.
All you have to do
is ask for a doctor
and we can admit you
right here. Sure.
Nice flowers.
Thanks.
William.
How you doing, deck?
All right. 346.
Dr. Wells.
Morning.
How are you?
Good to see you.
don't act
like a lawyer.
Hmm. "Do not enter."
How you doing,
Mr. McKenzie?
How are my tests?
Gall bladder.
Wrong fish.
Mr. Van Landel.
Good afternoon,
Mr. Van Landel.
Can you hear me,
Mr. Van Landel?
Hi.
Who are you?
I'm Deck Schifflet,
para-lawyer.
You haven't talked
to any insurance
companies, have you?
No.
Good. don't talk to 'em
because they're just
out to screw you.
Do you have a lawyer?
No.
My firm
handles more car wrecks
than anybody in Memphis.
Insurance companies
are terrified of us,
and we don't
charge a dime.
Can you wait
till my wife gets back?
Your wife, Mr. van--
ow!
Aah!
Sorry.
I'm very sorry,
Mr. Van Landel.
Very sorry.
Where is your wife,
Mr. Van Landel?
She'll be back
in a little while.
Well, I'm gonna
have to talk to her
down in my office
because there's a ton of
information that I need.
Just sign right there.
Remember,
don't talk to anybody
except your doctor.
There are gonna be
people coming at you
from every direction
offering you
settlements.
I do not want you
under any circumstances
to sign anything without
me reviewing it first.
Understand? My number
is on this card.
You can call me
24 hours a day.
Mr. Rudy Baylor's number
is on the back.
You can call that number
for him any time, OK?
Do you have
any questions?
No.
Good. We're gonna get
you a bunch of money.
Let's go.
I'm real sorry
about your leg.
I'd like to be alone please.
And that
is how it's done.
Piece of cake.
What if the guy
had a lawyer?
We came with nothing.
If he'd have thrown us
out of his room
for whatever reason,
what have we lost?
A little dignity.
Maybe a little self-respect.
You see...
In law school, Rudy,
they don't teach you
what you need to know.
It's all theories
and lofty notions
and big fat
ethics books.
What's wrong with ethics?
Nothing, I guess.
I mean,
I believe a lawyer
should fight
for his client,
refrain from
stealing money.
And try not to lie.
You know,
the basics.
That was blatant
ambulance chasing.
Right, but who cares?
There's a lot of lawyers
out there.
It's a marketplace.
It's a competition.
What they don't teach you
in law school can get you hurt.
How do you know
when a lawyer is lying?
His lips are moving.
What's the difference between
a hooker and a lawyer?
A hooker will stop screwing you
after you're dead.
Everybody loves
lawyer jokes,
especially lawyers.
They're even
sort of proud of 'em.
Why do you suppose that is?
A third party
is no different.
He may also be used
by the plaintiff
to bring in
a third party.
What the hell are you doing?
Oh, I'm studying.
I thought we was gonna
study on our own time.
I know, Bruiser,
but look, man,
the bar exam is next week,
all right?
It is next week.
I'm scared, man.
Hey, Rudy, look,
you want to study,
why don't you run over
to the hospital
and study with deck?
I'm not gonna study with--
I'm not gonna study
with deck.
Yeah, I got
a police report here.
Do we represent her,
this victim here?
Well, not yet.
Why don't you run
down to the hospital
and check it out?
Maybe you could
sign her up.
Would you
get me a soda?
Sure, darling.
Here you go.
Where did this
all come from?
Are you gonna
tell them where
all this stuff
came from?
I know
what's going on
the second
I lay eyes on them.
Like I'm 10 years old,
my father crying
in the bedroom,
my mother sitting
at the kitchen table
with blood
all over her face
telling me
that daddy's sorry,
and he's never
gonna do it again.
Jeez!
Just tell me yes!
Why are you
doing this to me?
It's always
the same with you!
You make me
so crazy!
Kelly Riker
was admitted
to St. Peter's hospital
3 days ago,
at midnight, I might add,
with assorted injuries.
The cops found her lying
on the sofa in the den,
beat to hell, wrapped
in a blanket, naked.
Cliff Riker,
her spouse,
was obviously intoxicated,
highly agitated,
and initially wanted
to dish out to the cops
what he was
giving his wife.
Which was, by the way,
a severe beating with
an aluminum baseball bat.
Evidently his weapon
of choice.
Let's talk about
Miss Birdie's millions.
No, I want to talk
about Cliff.
I want to talk about
what happened to Cliff.
He spent
the night in jail.
His family
bailed him out.
He's due in court
in a week.
Nothing will happen.
Uh, all right.
Colleen Janice Birdsong.
She did indeed inherit
a couple of million bucks
from her late
second husband.
But lawyers, bad trust
department investments,
and the IRS totally
devoured the estate.
All except
for about $40,000,
which Miss Birdie probably
tucked in her mattress
for all we know.
Sorry.

Oh, good morning, Rudy.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Oh, yeah, it's--
it's beautiful.
Oh, here's my mulch.
That's right.
There, there.
Right there. Yes.
Stop it, stop it.
All right. Just put it
right there now.
My yard boy will get it.
Just right down there.
Isn't that a fine
bunch of mulch?
Excuse me.
I'm not one
to meddle, but...
Are you all right?
Are you in pain?
No.
But thanks.
OK, well,
I'm right up here.
I'm just studying
for the bar exam,
so if you need
anything,
just holler at me.
OK.
Anything. All right?
I'll get it for you.
My name is Rudy Baylor.
Kelly Riker.
Nice to meet you.
Kelly, it's nice
to meet you, too.
Why don't you sit down?
Go ahead. Take a seat.
What school do you go to?
I went
to Austin Peay
and then law school
at Memphis state.
I always wanted
to go to college,
but it didn't work out.
Did you?
Yeah. I always
thought I'd go,
but it didn't work out.
What kind of lawyer
do you want to be?
Well, I enjoy trial
work, so, uh...
I'd like to spend my
days in the courtroom.
Defending criminals?
Maybe.
Maybe.
They're entitled
to a good defense.
They have a right
to their day in court.
Murderers?
Most murderers can't
afford a private lawyer.
Rapists and...
Child molesters?
No.
Men who beat their wives?
Criminal work is
a real rare specialty.
Um, I'll probably
be doing more, uh...
Civil litigation.
Like lawsuits and stuff.
Right.
Yeah.
It's, uh...
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.
Rudy Baylor.
Hey. Hey there.
It's me.
What you doing?
How's the fishing
going?
Um, it's, uh,
it's going well.
I'm actually talking
to the prospect right now.
Well, you
better sign her up.
What--Rudy? Rudy?
Can you hear me?
I enjoyed meeting you.
Rudy?
Yeah, thanks
for the company.
Hey, tomorrow night?
Maybe.
Time's up.
Pencils down.
Please pass your test booklets
to your right
so that your proctors
may gather them up.
In my first year
at law school,
everybody loved
everybody else
because we were all
studying the law,
and the law
was a noble thing.
By my third year,
you were lucky if you weren't
murdered in your sleep.
People stole exams,
hid research materials
from the library,
and lied to the professors.
Such is the nature
of the profession.
Right here.
Half an hour ago,
her husband came in...
And threw a bowl
of soup at her
because she just won't
get it through her head
how much he loves her.
This is my room.
Pregnant at 18, married,
then a miscarriage--
probably because
he beat her up--
and still,
she can't leave him.
You are gonna
have to help me.
Everything I've ever seen
tells me that this girl
is a loser,
scarred and broken
and maybe even dangerous,
but I've never really seen
anyone like her before,
and instead of running away,
all I want to do
is protect her.
Visiting hours are over, hon.
You kids need to wrap it up.
So...
He should be shot.
Any man who'd beat his wife
with an aluminum bat
needs to be shot.
How did you find out?
There are police reports,
there are ambulance reports,
there are hospital records.
How long are you
gonna wait, Kelly,
until he decides
to hit you in the head
with that bat of his?
'Cause that could kill you,
you know. That'd be it.
A couple of good shots
to the skull,
and that would be it.
Stop it.
don't tell me how it feels.
Look at me, Kelly.
Can I ask you something?
Do you have a father
or a brother?
Why?
Because if my daughter
got beat the way
your husband beat you,
I swear to God
I'd break his neck.
No big brother?
No.
No one to take care
of me, you know?
Kelly, I'll try to
help you any way I can,
but you have to
file for divorce.
Do it now while you're
in the hospital
being treated
for the last beating.
It'll sail through.
What better proof
is there than that?
I...I can't file
for a divorce.
Why not?
Because he'll kill me.
He tells me so
all the time.
That's not gonna happen.
Could you pass me
a pillow, please,
and put it under my foot?
There's one over there.
Here.
That OK?
Yeah.
Yeah? All right.
Could you pass me
my gown, too, please?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You need some help
putting it on?
No. Just turn around.
All right.
Hey!
Oh! Who are you?
I live here.
Who the hell are you?
Oh, my gosh.
I'm Delbert's wife.
Delbert? Who the hell
is Delbert?
How did you get in here?
Birdie gave me the key.
Who are you?
I am the person
who lives here.
Do you understand that?
You have no right
to be in here.
This is
a private residence.
Oh, yeah, right.
Some place. Get a grip.
Birdie wants to see you.
"Agreements are permanent,
and restrictions
mentioned above herein..."
What is this?
Well, you must
be the lawyer.
I'm Rudy Baylor.
I'm Delbert Birdsong,
Birdie's youngest.
He yelled at me.
He told me to get out
of his apartment.
That so?
You're damn right
that's so.
That goes
for the both of you.
I don't want neither one
of you up there
going through my stuff.
That's private property.
I come home
to check on mama,
and, damn, she's got a stinkin'
lawyer livin' with her.
You been messin'
with my mama's will?
Well, she's your mama.
Why don't you ask her?
She won't say a word.
Oh, well,
then neither can I.
That's a lawyer-client
privilege.
But I tell you what.
I made a couple
of phone calls...
Mm-hmm.
Verifying some accounts.
Your mama's
second husband
left her
an enormous fortune.
How big?
Big.
Big.
I hope you're
not meddling, boy.
Mama, wouldn't you just love
to come and visit with us
down in Florida for a while?
You'd love it
down there, mama.
Mama, come on back in
and get some cake, mama.
I'll get her some milk.
We're close
to the fountain of youth.
We ain't but 33 Miles away
and 180 Miles from Disney world.
How you feeling, Donny Ray?
Great.
don't I look fantastic?
You feel up to this?
Yeah. Let's go already.
All right.
A lawyer's not supposed
to become personally involved
with his client,
but there's
all kinds of lawyers
and all kinds
of clients, too.
You OK, baby?
Riker! Riker! Riker!
Riker! Riker!
Can I get you guys
anything else?
Um, want something?
I'll have a shot
of Jack Daniels, please.
What's it gonna do,
kill me?
Miss Birdie,
this is my friend Donny Ray.
Oh, Donny Ray,
I'm so glad to have you
come over and visit.
Hello, Miss Birdie.
Where--oh.
There you go.
You just come right
over here and sit down.
Just have a rest.
You have me all...
Blocked off here.
Well...
Sorry, Miss Birdie.
I got to take a break.
My back's killing me.
I almost forgot.
This came for you.
Oh, my God.
Ohh!
Isn't it exciting?
Ohh.
I'm so proud of you.
I passed the bar.
All right.
Hey, come on.
Here's to Rudy.
Congratulations
on passing the bar.
What the hell is that?
Iced tea.
Congratulations, Rudy.
That's some good work, boys.
I got a check today from
the Van Landel settlement.
I'm giving you boys
a bonus.
5,500 each.
Thank you.
Sign up some more cases,
huh?
OK.
Mmm.
So are we gonna be ready
for tomorrow morning?
9:00?
We're gonna argue
Great Benefit's motion
to dismiss.
Mmm, yeah, I think
we're ready. We're ready.
Deck and I have been going
over it. I think we're ready.
I hope so,
because I might, uh...
I might have you handle
some of that argument, Rudy.
It would be awfully embarrassing
if we lose this case
on a dismissal.
Boss?
OK, I got to go.
Food's on me.
Enjoy your meat.
Thanks a lot, Bruiser.
Appreciate it.
Something's
about to go down.
I'm sure of it.
He never split money
like that before.
What do you think's
behind his generosity?
Come on, man.
Oh, yeah?
Here.
Yesterday, one of Bruiser's
ex-partners testified
before a grand jury.
I think he's cut a deal.
It's just a matter of time
before he's singing
on Bruiser.
So what?
So...You're gonna
have to make a move.
Make a move?
Deck, I just got here.
Yeah? Well, things
might get a little hot.
Jury-tampering,
tax evasion,
money-skimming,
you name it.
I'm nervous,
real nervous.
What are you nervous about?
They can't arrest us.
Listen...
Supposing they come in with
subpoenas and hacksaws. Huh?
They can do that.
They've been known to do
that in racketeering cases.
They come in,
they confiscate the files,
they haul the computers out.
What's that leave us?
I'm not worried
about being arrested.
I'm worried about my job.
All right, so what
are you saying here?
Let's bolt.
How much money you got?
I got...Got $5,500.
Me, too.
We can rent
a small office,
$500 a month.
We operate on a shoestring
for the first 6 months.
It'll be beautiful.
We split everything,
everything
right down the middle,
50-50.
Costs, expenses,
profits--everything
right down the middle.
What's the matter?
You don't want
to be my partner?
Um, no, it's not--they--
it's not that.
It's just that you...
You're hitting me
with this right now,
and I mean, you got to
give me a minute, all right?
I mean, you can't
just spring it on me.
We have to act fast.
All right.
Let's do it.
We'll do it
for a while,
see how it goes.
How many files
do you have?
Um, I...
I got 3.
Get them out of there.
Take them home,
but don't get caught,
OK?
Is somebody watching us?
The feds.
I'm eatin' too fast.
Sorry.
Hey. Listen, I went by
the office this morning.
The FBI was chaining up
the front door.
Is Bruiser comin'?
I doubt it.
Arrest warrants
have been issued
for both Bruiser
and Prince.
Oh, man.
Just relax.
You can do this.
It's just a motion.
Go on.
Me?
Yeah. Come on.
I'm gonna be sick.
You know this case.
You're gonna be fine.
Listen, I don't even
have my license.
We don't need
a license. Come on.
I've memorized
the Black files cold.
I've read all the books
on jurisprudence,
the rules of evidence
and discovery,
but I take one look
around the courtroom,
and I realize I haven't
even been born yet.
Excuse me. Uh, sir?
Your honor, um, ahem.
I'm here for the<i> Black</i>
<i>vs. Great Benefit</i> hearing.
And who are you?
Uh, Rudy Baylor.
I work for J. Lyman Stone.
Oh, you work for
J. Lyman.
Staunch supporter
of the tobacco lobby.
Where's Mr. Stone?
Um...
Honestly, your honor,
I--I don't know.
He was supposed
to meet me here,
and I don't know
where he is.
Well, why doesn't that
surprise me?
So what do you want?
You want a continuance.
No, your honor.
I--I am prepared
to argue this motion.
Are you a lawyer?
Well, I just
passed the bar,
and, uh, these
are my clients.
Mr. Stone filed this
on my behalf
until I passed the bar.
Well, you got a hell
of a lot of nerve
walking into my courtroom
without a license.
Now get the hell out of here,
get your license,
and then you come back.
Get a license!
Come back when you
got a damn license!
May it
please the court...
For the record, my name
is Leo F. Drummond
of Tinley-Brit,
counsel
for Great Benefit,
and I say
if this young man
has passed the bar exam,
your honor, let him
argue the case.
We welcome him to, uh,
big-time litigation.
You have no objection,
Mr. Drummond?
If it please the court,
I would be honored
to introduce Mr. Baylor
to the practice of law
in the great state
of Tennessee.
Judge, you can give him
the oath right now,
and I'll be pleased
to stand for him.
Are you certain you're prepared
to proceed, Mr. Baylor?
Abso--
Yeah. Your honor, yes.
Very well, then.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear,
Rudy Baylor,
that you will support
the constitution and the laws
of the United States
and the state of Tennessee
faithfully and honorably,
conduct yourself in the practice
of your profession
to the best of your skills
and abilities, so help you God?
I do.
- OK, fine, fine. That's it.
- Let's move on.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Welcome to the war.
Sworn in by a fool
and vouched for by a scoundrel.
Harvey.
I'm a lawyer at last.
Come on in.
May I, Harv?
Sure.
Uh, sit down.
Um...
This lawsuit bothers me,
Mr. Baylor.
I wouldn't use the word
"Frivolous,"
but I'm not impressed
with the merits of it,
to be Frank.
Ahem. I'm gonna try
to sneak some gym time in.
In fact, I'm really tired
of these type of lawsuits.
don't make no excuses.
I'm inclined to grant
the motion to dismiss.
Now, you can, uh, refile it
in federal court, you know,
take it somewhere else.
I don't want it
clogging up my docket.
Now, excuse me
while I go to the can.
You, too.
Rudy...
I'm a very expensive lawyer
from a very expensive firm,
and, uh...
I've had a lot of cases.
I can hit pretty close to
the center of the dart board,
and I told my clients,
Great Benefit,
that cost alone here
gonna be a big deal.
And for you, too.
Your side, too.
Now, they've
authorized me...
To offer you
and your clients...
$50,000 to settle
this thing out.
And I--I may even be able
to raise that figure up
as high as, uh,
maybe 75,000.
No admission of liability,
you understand.
Course, uh...
If you say no,
then it's going
to be world war III.
My turn now.
May I, Harv?
Sure.
Uh...
There's not much
of a lawsuit here,
I'm afraid, son.
But maybe I could
lean on Leo
to make you an offer
of a settlement.
They'll probably want
to throw some money at you
to keep from paying Leo
a thousand bucks a minute.
But he already offered me
the cost of the defense.
Oh, really?
How much?
Uh, 75,000.
Jeez.
Well, looky here, son,
you'd be crazy
not to take that.
You think so?
75,000? Jeez.
That's a...
That's a bunch of money.
Doesn't sound like Leo.
Well, he's a--
he's a great guy.
Hmm.
Whoo.
So?
That was not a meeting
in chambers.
That was an ambush.
What happened?
They tag-teamed me.
Yeah.
Think they would have
done that to Bruiser?
Nah. Bruiser's
too savvy for that.
So what?
They offered me
75,000.
Good. Take it.
Our third is 25,000.
We need the money.
Judge Hale is serious
about dismissing this case.
He's an just
an old angry man
who's been sitting
on that bench too long.
The best thing we can do
is grab what we can
to make things easy
on his parents.
The insurance company
made an offer to settle.
What kind of offer?
$75,000.
They figure
that's what it's gonna cost
to pay their lawyers
to defend the case.
Oh.
Son of a bitches think
they can just buy us off.
That's exactly
what they think.
You better talk to him.
Do you wanna settle,
Rudy?
I mean, some of the money
is yours.
No way.
I wanna expose
these people.
Mama, could you get me
a glass of water, please?
Sure, baby.
Whatever you get out
of this case,
take care of my family
with it.
I really love them.
I can't help thinking
that while we're all out there
scrambling around for an edge
like we're never gonna die,
this boy's
looking right at it,
and he's doing it
almost alone.
I can't even begin
to imagine the courage
it must take.
Hello?
Guess who died
last night.
Who?
Do you ever sleep?
Harvey Hale.
62.
Quite a pedigree.
Judge Hale?
Yep. Croaked
with a heart attack.
Dropped dead
in his swimming pool.
You gotta be kidding me.
Uh-uh.
You gotta be kidding me.
Mm-mmm.
Guess what newly made judge
was assigned Great Benefit
case in his place.
How in the hell am I
supposed to know that?
Tyrone Kipler.
Black Harvard
civil-rights lawyer.
He can't stand
Tinley-Brit,
and he's tough
on insurance companies--
sues them all the time.
Great luck for us.
All right, all right.
You know what
a rainmaker is kid?
The bucks are gonna be
falling from the sky!
It's 5:00 right now.
What time you coming down?
I'll be down in a minute.
Get down here. We gotta
talk about fast-tracking.
Coffee's on the way.
OK.
Mr. Drummond...
You've objected
to the fast-tracking
of this case.
What's the problem?
Well, your honor, uh...
This issue's already
been ruled upon
by Judge Hale.
Uh, the preparations
required
for fast-tracking
the case
place an undue burden
on both parties,
I believe.
Nonsense.
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Drummond.
As a defense lawyer,
have you<i> ever</i> agreed
to the fast-tracking
of a lawsuit?
Why, your honor,
I believe I have.
Fine.
Give me the name of the case
and the court it was in.
Well...
Well, your honor,
I have to get back
to you on that.
Well, call me
this afternoon by 3:00.
I don't believe I'm gonna
be in before 3:00.
Oh. Well,
call me when you get in.
I'm very anxious to hear
about this case
you agreed to fast-track.
Yes, sir.
This boy is about to die,
gentlemen.
You do agree that we need
to record his testimony.
Yes, indeed.
Of course,
your honor.
It's just
my trial calendar
is pushing me around
pretty good.
How about next
Thursday afternoon?
Great for me,
your honor.
I'm sorry,
your honor.
That's a week
from today.
I believe
I'm out of town.
Yes, I am out
of town Thursday.
Deposition is set for...
Next Thursday afternoon
at 2 P.M.
Sorry if it inconveniences
the defense,
but God knows there's enough
of you guys to handle it.
Now, what's next?
Oh, uh, your honor,
the motion to dismiss
is still pending.
Ah, yes.
That motion is denied.
Well...
I guess that's it.
Gentlemen, let's go.
Congratulations
on your appointment,
your honor.
Thank you, sir.
And, Mr. Drummond...
don't forget to call me
with the name of that case
you agreed to fast-track.
I'll look around.
You in over your head,
son?
Absolutely.
Now Deck wants to do an ad
on the local rap station.
And as much as I'd love
to hear it,
we can't afford it.
Furnishings, bar dues,
750 for a fax machine,
400 for a lease
on a computer,
a down payment
on a new secondhand car,
and we're broke again.
Deck says he's thrilled
with the way things are going.
Whoa.
Rudy. Hi.
Hey, Dot.
Come in.
How are you?
I'm doing good.
How you doing?
Good.
Listen, I'm going up to
Cleveland Wednesday night.
It's the headquarters
of Great Benefit.
I'm gonna take depositions
from all the executives.
Oh.
So...
And don't worry
about expenses, either.
We're gonna
take care of it.
Thank you, Rudy.
It's no problem.
Shh!
It's awkward.
My associate,
Deck Schifflet.
How do you do?
Hi.
Hey, Rudy...
Tyrone's here.
OK.
The judge is here.
Oh.
Here, wait, Dot.
Give me that.
Oh.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello.
Come right in.
Thank you.
This is
Mrs. Black.
His honor
Tyrone Kipler.
It's a privilege
to meet you.
The privilege
is mine.
Oh, uh, come on in.
There's not a lot
of room here.
Tight.
Let's take a look
outside.
Is that all right
with you, son?
Sure, OK.
All right.
All right.
I'll show you the way.
I'm looking
at a team of lawyers
who are pulling down
a $1,000 an hour,
and I hate them.
From their lofty perch,
pissing down
on the whole justice system
with disdain.
I used to hate them because
I wasn't good enough for them.
Now I hate them
for who they represent
and what they represent.
Your honor, how are you?
Fine, sir.
Hope the dogs
didn't startle you.
We're doing
this thing outside.
It's a little
cramped inside.
Just have a seat
here.
How you doing?
Good.
Thank you.
Hey, Donny Ray?
Hey.
You've already met
Judge Kipler.
Howdy.
This is Leo F. Drummond
and associates.
This here is Tammy.
She's the court reporter.
Hi.
Swear him in.
Do you swear
the testimony you
are about to give
will be the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
Yes, I do.
I told him...
I know. Come here,
come here, come here.
don't worry about it.
It's just a deposition.
Donny Ray,
I'm Leo Drummond.
I represent
Great Benefit,
and I'm very sorry...
I'm very sorry
to be here
under these
circumstances.
Well, we wouldn't be here
if your clients had done
what they should've done.
I beg your pardon?
I didn't hear that.
Hey, kid,
you want a stick
of gum?
Sure.
Here. Did you break
your arm?
Yep.
You had an accident?
Why?
Well, I'm a lawyer,
and, uh...
Give this to your mom--
you his mom?
Maybe I can get you some
money for the accident.
Why don't you
help with the display?
OK. I'll go help
this man first.
Oh, no. I got it.
It's fine.
Can I help you,
sir?
Oh, I'm just looking.
There's a cinema
down the street.
Buy a ticket.
Center section, back row.
Be there in 30 minutes.
OK.
Cliff wants me
to have a baby.
Well, you have
a decision to make.
He's become obsessed
with sex.
He thinks it's going
to keep us together.
Listen, I really don't
want to talk about that.
I just wanted to see you.
I think
I can smell her perfume
all the way to Cleveland.
It's hard keeping my mind on
Leo Drummond and his people.
They'll be flying in,
first class,
and after
a leisurely dinner,
they'll meet
in some board room
and discuss
my total destruction.
Around the time
I'm checking into motel 6,
they'll be sleeping soundly
in their suites.
And they'll wake up
fresh and rested
and ready for war.
It's my deposition,
but it's their turf.
Ah, young Rudy Baylor.
Just on time, too.
Mr. Drummond.
Get this boy
some coffee, Tyler.
Jack Underhall.
Rudy Baylor.
Young lawyer is always
a hungry lawyer.
All these boys claims,
underwriting...
There must be
a 100 years of legal experience
gathered around the table.
My staff has flunked
the bar exam 6 times.
Now, Rudy,
don't be intimidated
by all these boys on
this side of the table.
I guarantee, you get
them on the golf course,
they fold
like a cheap suit.
Let's see.
Let's see
what we got here.
I think maybe it's, uh,
appropriate
to start with
the corporate designee,
Jack Underhall here.
I--I don't think so.
I beg your pardon?
Well, you heard me.
I want to start with,
uh, Jackie Lemancyzk,
the claims handler.
I think it's best we start
with Mr. Underhall.
With all due respect,
Mr. Drummond,
this is my deposition.
I'm gonna call these witnesses
in the order in which I see fit,
so I'd like to start
with Jackie Lemancyzk.
Maybe we should just
go call the judge.
Oh, I don't believe
we have to get pugilistic
this time of the morning.
I'm not admitting
to being pugilistic.
We're simply having
a little problem
with, uh,
Jackie Lemancyzk.
Uh, this Polish woman.
What sort of problem?
She doesn't work here
anymore.
Was she fired?
She resigned.
She resigned.
Um, well,
where is she now?
Well...
She is no longer working
for our client, and, uh,
we can't produce her
as a witness,
so let's move along.
All right.
Russell Crockett.
Anybody in the room
named Russell Crockett?
He's gone, too.
He was downsized.
Downsized?
Well, what a coincidence.
Our client's going through
a periodic downsizing.
Yeah, that will happen,
won't it?
How about
Everett, uh, Lufkin...
Vice President of Claims.
Has he been downsized,
too?
No, he's here.
You're Everett Lufkin?
Mm-hmm.
My congratulations...
Mr. Lufkin...
On your miraculous
survival
of the carnage of late
here at Great Benefit.
Whoo.
I may not be 100% today,
but I'm here in spirit.
I'm curious.
About what?
I'm just wondering.
Do you even remember
when you first sold out?
You're an arrogant
little piss ant, aren't you?
I advise you
to mind your manners.
You're in
the big water now.
Mind my manners?
I come up here
from Memphis
to depose 4 people,
2 of whom are not here,
and you tell me
to mind my manners?
Well, it's your dime.
What's your call, son?
I'm gonna depose him--
Mr. Lufkin over there--
then I'm gonna pack up,
I'm gonna go back
to Memphis.
So this is how
the uninsured die.
In a society filled
with brilliant doctors
and state-of-the-art
technology,
it's obscene to let this boy
just wither away and die.
He was covered
by an insurance policy
that his mother
paid good money for.
It wasn't big money,
but it was good money.
I'm alone in this trial.
I'm seriously outgunned,
and I'm scared,
but I'm right.
I sit here with
this poor suffering kid,
and I swear revenge.
Hello?
Rudy, it's me.
What's--what's wrong?
I need your help.
Where are you?
I'm at the store.
OK, um, don't move, OK?
I'm gonna
be right there.
All right.
Rudy Baylor.
She's in here.
Thanks for coming.
What happened?
Come on,
let's show him.
I got you.
It's all right.
Ohh.
Oh, Rudy,
I'm so glad you called.
Come. Come.
Oh, you poor child.
I'm gonna
take care of you now.
don't you worry.
don't you worry.
We'll manage just fine.
All right.
You know where I'll be
if you need me.
I do. I do.
I tell myself
I'll do whatever
I have to do
to get her out of this
because this guy's never gonna
stop until he's killed her.
Never.
Well...
Now it's
a wrongful death suit.
Gazillions.
Deck...
I'm so sorry, Dot.
Well, thank you so much
for coming.
Appreciate it.
It'll be OK.
Hey!
For bugs?
Shh. Shh.
Here?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Enjoy your meal.
This bugging device
has got...
Medium-grade circuitry.
It's a weak transmitter.
Probably manufactured
in Czechoslovakia.
No, I don't think
the cops or the feds
would place this.
Somebody else
is listening.
Who else would be
listening to us?
Hmm.
I got a pretty good idea.
Rudy.
Yeah?
Just checking in.
You need anything
from downtown?
No.
Hey, guess what.
Guess who wants to settle.
Who?
Dot Black.
Dot Black?
I went by there today,
and, uh,
check up on her.
I brought her
a fruitcake.
Yeah, and she said she just
doesn't have the willpower
to stand a long trial
and, uh...
How much?
She said
she'd take 175.
I think
we should take it.
We'll sleep on it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right,
but I say you take it.
I know. I heard you.
I'll think about it.
All right. Bye.
Hah.
Son...
This family's been
through a hell of a lot,
and I feel this woman
wants to settle.
I'll talk to her.
You go ahead
and call her.
I'll wait here
one while.
I'll get back to you,
Mr. Drummond.
Good day.
I'm sorry about the boy.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, my client, uh,
wants to settle, Rudy.
Let's say, Rudy,
just for the sake of putting
the numbers on the board,
that if the claim
was covered
that my client should have
paid out somewhere
around 150-175,000.
Well, if you say so.
They bugged our phones.
I do say so.
And, uh, we will offer...
Guess we should...
Tell Judge Kipler.
I don't think so.
Why not?
I have an idea.
Um...
A kind of a crazy idea.
Jury tampering.
I love it.
I<i> love</i> it.
Who's our biggest
nightmare?
The judge gave us
the names
of 92 potential jurors.
We investigated
their backgrounds,
and we rated them
with plus or minus numbers.
What do you want me
to do?
All right. Here we go.
What?
Any direct contact
would of course
be a serious offense.
What are we doing?
We're gonna
do this thing.
Just do what I say.
Hello.
Yeah, uh,
Rudy Baylor, please.
Uh,
this is Rudy Baylor.
Uh, this is Billy Porter.
Uh, you stopped
by the shop today.
Yes. Mr. Porter.
Thank you very much
for calling back.
What do you want?!
Uh, yes, well,
it's about the trial.
You know, the one you got
a jury summons for.
I'm one of the lawyers.
Uh-huh.
Is--is this legal?
Uh, of course
it's legal, Mr. Porter.
Just don't
go telling anybody.
Look, I represent this lady
whose son died of leukemia
because the Great Benefit
insurance company
wouldn't give them
the money they needed
for an operation.
Oh, why,
that sounds awful.
You know, I had an aunt
that had that same disease.
Kept wasting away
and my Uncle cried and--
I'll do what I can.
Well, yes, sir.
Now, thank you, Mr. Porter.
You have a fine afternoon.
Bye. Bye.
What--what--
what about the aunt?
Where'd the aunt
come from?
I don't know.
You told me
to be sympathetic.
I know but you don't
have to--
don't elaborate.
Get your coffee.
Let's go back
up there.
I'm just trying to help.
Come on.
Right behind you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
what I'm about to ask
is the most important
question of the day.
It's a simple question.
Can be answered
yes or no.
Listen carefully.
Have any of y'all been
contacted about this case?
This is
serious business.
Bingo.
We need to know now.
Let me ask it another way.
Did any of you have
a conversation recently
with either
Mr. Rudy Baylor
or directly behind him,
Mr. Deck Schifflet.
Objection, your honor!
This is an outrage!
What are you doing,
Mr. Drummond?
Your honor,
we have reason to believe
that this panel
has been tampered with.
And he's
accusing me.
I don't understand what
you're doing, Mr. Drummond.
Well, neither do I,
your honor.
Neither do I.
Approach the bench, please.
Your honor, this panel's
been tampered with.
I want proof, Leo.
I can't say
without divulging
confidential information,
your honor.
You are just
out of your mind.
You are acting
rather bizarrely.
I'm gonna prove it.
How?
Accuse us
of something like that.
Tamper. I--
it's ridiculous.
Just allow me to finish
questioning the panel.
I think the truth
will come forth.
Any objection,
Mr. Baylor?
No, no objection.
Very well. Proceed.
Right.
What in the Sam hill
is going on up there?
Oh, it's just
lawyer stuff.
Mr. Porter.
I want to ask you
a direct question.
And I'd appreciate
an honest response.
You ask an honest
question,
I'll give you
an honest answer.
Fair enough.
Did you, Mr. Porter,
or did you not
have a phone conversation
a few days ago
with Mr. Rudy Baylor?
Hell, no.
I thought
you were gonna give me
an honest answer.
I gave you an honest answer.
Are you sure,
Mr. Porter?
I'm damn sure.
Mr. Porter,
in a courthouse.
In a courthouse
in the United States,
in a courthouse of justice,
state of Tennessee,
I say you did not provide
an honest answer!
don't call me a liar.
Mr. Drummond.
You son of a bitch.
Hey, get off him!
Order in the court!
Bailiff,
remove Mr. Porter
from this courtroom.
Mr. Billy Porter,
you are excused from the jury.
Your honor,
I move to dismiss the entire
panel, your honor.
Denied.
It's been tainted.
You, uh...
Your shoe,
you left it--
Are we ready
to proceed now
with the jury selection,
Mr. Drummond?
I'm ready
to proceed, your honor.
Thank you.
We'll file it today.
He'll go crazy.
He already is crazy.
He'll come after you.
I hope he does.
This is that good
processed Turkey.
Oh.
Oh.
Well, I gotta get
back to court.
I'm late. I gotta
get back to court.
What about
your sandwich?
Oh, I was gonna
take that with me.
Good, good.
I'll see you
later.
OK?
How'd it go?
I served the papers
on Cliff
when he was
on his way to lunch.
He didn't take it
too well,
but I said I was
ready to rumble.
He backed down.
Hey, man, you better
watch your back.
All right.
Thanks a lot, Butch.
I appreciate it.
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you're
about to give in this cause
will be the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God.
Yes, I do.
You may take
the stand.
Please state your name
for the record.
Mrs. Margarine Black.
Now, Mrs. Black,
you are the mother
of Donny Ray Black,
who recently died of acute
myelocytic leukemia
because the defendant,
Great Benefit--
Objection.
Leading.
Sustained.
Your son,
Donny Ray,
needed an operation.
Objection.
Leading.
Sustained.
Mrs. Black, did you purchase
this medical policy
because you were concerned about
medical care for your son?
Objection.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Leading.
Mr. Baylor,
why don't you
show the policy
and ask her
why she bought it?
OK.
Mr. Baylor.
You must ask
to approach the witness.
Sorry,
your honor.
Permission to approach
the witness.
You may.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
"Great Benefit.
July 7, 1996.
"Re: Policy 7849909886.
"Dear Mrs. Black,
"on 7 prior occasions
"this company has denied
your claim in writing.
"We now deny it
for the eighth and final time.
"You must be stupid,
stupid, stupid."
"Sincerely Everett Lufkin,
Vice President,
Claims Department."
Read it again.
Objection.
Repetitious,
your honor.
Sustained.
I tender
the witness.
Mr. Drummond.
Your honor.
Please remove that exhibit.
Now, Mrs. Black.
Ahem.
Turn it off.
Mrs. Black, why did you sue
Great Benefit for $10 million?
Is that all?
I beg your pardon.
I thought it was
more than that.
Is that so?
Yes. Your client has
about a billion dollars,
and your client
killed my son.
I wanted to sue
for a whole lot more.
What would you do
with the money?
If this jury awards you
$10 million,
what you gonna do
with the money?
I'm gonna give it
to the American
leukemia society.
Every cent.
I don't want a dime
of your stinking money.
Realize you are
under oath, Mrs. Black.
Approach the witness,
your honor?
You may.
Mrs. Black,
I want you to read
from the policy.
Page 16, section "K,"
paragraph 14, item "E,"
in which
the insurance company
has in plain
English wording said
that it will not pay for
experimental procedures.
Now, your lawsuit says
that your son would have
been saved if he had had
a bone marrow
transplant.
Isn't it a fact,
Mrs. Black,
that there are
only 7,000
bone marrow transplants
performed a year
in the United States?
Less than 200 in
the state of Tennessee?
Objection,
your honor.
He's leading
the witness.
This is cross-examination.
Leading is allowed.
Overruled,
as to leading.
So it was not
covered by the policy.
Now, Mrs. Black,
who was it, uh...
Who was it first diagnosed
your son's condition?
Well, at the very
beginning,
our doctor,
Dr. page.
That would be
your family physician?
Yes, sir, it would.
Is he a good doctor?
He's a very good doctor.
And is it not true,
Mrs. Black,
that this capable,
truthful man
told you repeatedly
that a bone marrow transplant
would do your son no good
because of the type
of leukemia he had?
Well, no.
No, he did not.
He didn't say that.
Not like that,
to me.
Approach
the witness, your honor?
You may.
Mrs. Black, is this not
Dr. page's letterhead?
And at the bottom there,
is that not his signature?
He can't do that.
Why?
Because he can't
introduce evidence
that way.
Plus it's hearsay.
Objection, your honor.
A--a letter from--from
the Blacks' family physician
to Mr. Drummond
is inadmissible.
That is quite
correct, your honor.
And I'm not asking
for this letter
to be admitted
into evidence.
I'm simply asking
that this witness
be allowed
to read the letter
under rule 612
of the Tennessee
rules of evidence.
So her recollection
can be refreshed.
Mr. Baylor,
what do you say?
I don't know, your honor.
I just object to this.
And also we were not
furnished this letter
in pre-trial discovery.
What do you say
to that, Mr. Drummond?
I had no idea this
letter would be needed.
I expected this lady
to tell the truth
about what her doctor
told her.
Anything else, Mr. Baylor?
No.
Mr. Drummond,
I'm gonna give you
a little latitude,
but don't stray too far.
Very well, your honor.
Now, Mrs. Black,
does that letter refresh
your recollection
as to whether or not
Donny Ray's leukemia
was the kind
that could be helped
with a bone marrow
transplant?
Well, see, now,
he is not a specialist.
But he is a licensed,
experienced,
capable physician
who lovingly told you
time and time again
what you quite understandably
did not want to accept:
That your son
was going to die of leukemia
despite the best efforts
of medical science.
Is that not true?
But he wasn't
a specialist.
I didn't believe him.
Not only did you
not believe him, ma'am,
but you were less than
truthful with me
and with this jury
moments ago
when you told us under oath
that Dr. page never said
that your son
had the type of leukemia
that could not be treated
by a bone marrow transplant.
I believe
your exact words were,
"he never said that.
"Not like that
to me."
He wasn't a specialist.
I just wanted Donny Ray
to have the best medical
treatment available.
You'd do the same thing.
Of course, ma'am.
Of course.
That'll be all.
You may step down,
Mrs. Black.
I didn't do very good,
did I?
Oh, no, no,
you did fine.
You did fine.
It's all right.
The jury can see
exactly what
he's up to.
The jury can see
what he's up to.
I need a smoke.
I know you do.
We're gonna get
to that later.
I hope he hasn't
changed the locks.
Are you scared?
Yeah.
Let's do it.
What a pig.
I'm sorry.
Hurry, Kelly.
Come on.
There's more of my stuff
in the closet.
You can't take
everything, Kelly.
Oh, no.
Hey, hello!
I'm home!
Well, what do you know?
What do we have here?
What you two been doing
in here, huh?
Hey, take it easy,
all right?
Come on, tell me.
I'm your husband.
Remember that, huh?
Take it easy, Buddy.
You shut up!
Hey, listen, Buddy,
all right.
I ain't listening
to nothing!
Take it easy.
Aah!
You hurt me, baby.
You hurt me so bad.
Why are you
doing this to me?!
No, Cliff!
Run!
Rudy, Rudy!
Cliff!
You idiot,
what are you doing?!
You see what you did?
Kelly!
Is this what you wanted?
It's not my fault!
I love you!
I love you!
Rudy!
Stop it, Rudy.
Stop.
Ohh.
Give me the bat
and leave.
What?
Give me the bat and leave.
You were not here tonight.
Give me the bat.
Go, Rudy.
You were not here tonight.
He's finally killed her.
No, it's him.
He's dead.
You sure?
Just saw her.
How'd it happen?
I don't know.
They say
when you commit a murder,
you make
at least 25 mistakes,
and later you're lucky
if you remember 5 of 'em.
It was self-defense,
but I can't get past
the fact that he's dead.
And the mistakes are piling
up in my mind so fast
I can't think.
But Kelly knew.
She knew what to do.
She knew it was time.
With everything
that was happening
and all that was at stake,
her first thought
was for my safety.
And I left her in there
all alone.
Damn it!
God damn you, Kelly!
What the hell's
going on here?
What the hell
did you do?
You killed
my son!
God damn you!
Excuse me.
I'm her lawyer.
I insist on being here
while she's being questioned.
This is
your attorney?
Yes, sir.
I want her released
to my custody.
I can't do that
I don't know what kind
of lawyer you are,
but we got
a dead body here,
and bond needs to be set
by a judge.
I'm going to jail?
Well, can we arrange
for a private cell?
Look, asshole,
I don't run the jail.
You got a better way
of doing things,
then you need to talk
to the jailer.
They love lawyers
down there, right?
Look...
If your lawyer here
is worth his salt,
you'll be out of here
sometime tomorrow if
you can post bond, OK?
OK.
You got 5.
Thank you.
They're watching us
through that window there,
and this room
is probably bugged,
so just be careful
what you say.
What does
"manslaughter" mean?
It's just murder without
the element of intent.
How much time
could I get?
No, no, no, you have
to be convicted first.
I'm not gonna
let that happen.
That's not gonna happen.
Cross your wrists
behind you please, ma'am.
This way, ma'am.
Mr. Lufkin,
you are the Vice
President of Claims
at Great Benefit,
are you not?
Yes, I am.
Approach the witness,
your honor?
You may.
You recognize this?
Go on.
Read that
to the jury.
"Dear Mrs. Black,
"on 7 prior occasions
"this company has denied
your claim in writing.
"We now deny it
for the eighth and final time.
"You must be stupid,
stupid, stupid.
"Sincerely Everett Lufkin,
Vice President, Claims."
That's you?
Yes.
How do you explain that?
It was a difficult time
for me personally.
I was under
a lot of stress.
We had denied this claim
7 times before.
I was trying to be emphatic.
I snapped.
I regret
having written the letter,
and I apologize.
don't you think
it's a little late
for an apology?
Maybe.
Maybe?
The boy is dead,
isn't he?
Yes.
Now, Mr. Lufkin,
who is Jackie Lemancyzk?
Jackie Lemancyzk
is a former claims handler.
And did she work
in your department?
Yes.
And when did she
stop working
for Great Benefit?
I don't remember the day.
How about October 30?
Sounds close.
Wasn't that just 2 days
before she was scheduled
to give a deposition
in this case?
I really don't remember.
I'd like to refresh the
witness' recollection
under rule 612.
October 30th.
Apparently.
And that was just 2 days
before she was scheduled
to give a deposition
in this matter?
I guess so.
And she was
the person responsible
for handling
Donny Ray Black's claim,
was she not?
That's correct.
And you fired her?
Of course not.
Well, how'd you
get rid of her?
She resigned.
It's right here in the letter
you just gave me.
Oh. Why'd she resign?
"I hereby resign
for personal reasons"
so it was her idea
to leave her job?
That's what it says.
Nothing further.
You may step down, sir.
Hello.
Hi. I'm Jackie Lemancyzk's
brother James.
Is it possible
to see her?
James Lemancyzk?
Yes.
One minute.
All rise.
Let me explain,
Miss Lemancyzk.
I'm really
not your brother.
Rudy. Good.
I'd like you to meet
Jackie Lemancyzk.
This is Jackie Lemancyzk.
Where she goes,
Carl goes.
This is my partner,
Rudy S. Baylor.
Just tell him
what you told me.
Miss Lemancyzk.
It's a pleasure
to meet you.
Is it all right
if I sit down?
Sure, sure.
All right,
Miss Lemancyzk,
let's talk
about the Black file.
It was assigned to you?
Yes, that's correct.
The initial claim
from Mrs. Black
was assigned to me.
Pursuant to company
policy at the time,
I sent her
a letter of denial.
Why?
Why?
Because all claims
were initially denied.
All claims?
All claims.
OK, this is how it works.
The policy...
Is sold door to door
in the poorer
neighborhoods.
Paid in cash
each week.
The claim comes in
and is assigned to a handler.
That's basically
a low level paper pusher.
Anyway, the handler
reviews it
and immediately sends
a letter to the insured
denying the claim.
The claims handler
then sends the file
over to underwriting.
Underwriting sends a memo
back to claims
saying, "don't pay this
until you hear from us."
Now, what you should
keep in mind
is that even though
all these people work
for this big company,
and they all work
in the same building,
they don't know each other.
Nor do they know what the other
department is up to.
Now, this is very intentional.
The departments are kept
at war with each other.
Now, meanwhile,
there's the client.
And they're getting
all these letters.
Some from claims,
some from underwriting,
and most people give up.
And this, of course,
is...
Intended.
Your next witness,
Mr. Baylor.
Plaintiff calls
Jackie Lemancyzk.
What'd he say?
Ohh.
Objection, your honor.
Approach the bench?
You may.
This is a complete
surprise, your honor.
Why? She's listed as
a potential witness.
We have a right
to be forewarned.
When did you find her?
I didn't know
she was lost.
It's a fair question,
Mr. Baylor.
Well, it's
my first trial.
That's not good enough.
It is a matter of fairness,
your honor.
We have a right to be
notified about your witness.
I agree.
Are you telling me
she can't testify?
She's listed in the pretrial
order, your honor.
Pursuant to rule 26.06,
we have the right
to call her as a witness.
Objection overruled.
Go memorize.
State your name
for the record.
Jackie Lemancyzk.
Miss Lemancyzk,
how long did you work
for Great Benefit?
6 years.
And when did
your employment end?
October 30th.
How did it end?
I was fired.
You mean
you did not resign?
No, I was fired.
Approach the witness,
your honor?
You may.
I am baffled,
Miss Lemancyzk,
because I have
this letter here,
and it says you quit
for personal reasons.
The letter is a lie.
I was fired so the company
could claim
that I no longer
worked there.
Can you please point out
the man in the courtroom
who made you
write this letter?
Jack Underhall.
He told me I was leaving
immediately,
and I had 2 choices--
I could call it a firing
and leave with nothing,
or I could write
that letter,
call it a resignation,
and the company would
give me $10,000 in cash
to keep quiet.
And I had to make
that decision
right there
in his presence.
Go on.
I took the cash...
And I also signed a letter
saying I would never discuss
any of my claims files
with anybody.
Including
the Black file?
Specifically the Black file.
So you knew that claim
should have been paid?
Everybody knew...
But the company
was playing the odds.
What odds?
The odds that the insured
would not consult a lawyer.
Now, during that time...
You were a senior
claims examiner?
Yes, that's correct.
During that time, was
there ever an occasion
when you were given
instructions
regarding how you should
handle claims?
Deny all claims for a year.
Add up the money saved,
deduct the amount spent
on quick court settlements,
and there's
a pot of gold left.
Approach the clerk,
your honor?
You may.
Thank you.
Number 6, please.
Here's what has
heretofore been marked
defense exhibit
number 6.
Do you
recognize this?
Yes. It's a Great Benefits
company claims manual.
Would you do me a favor
and just flip over
to section "U," please?
There is
no section "U."
But do you remember
a section "U"
when you were a senior
claims examiner?
Yes, I do.
Section "U" was
an executive memorandum
in the senior
examiners manual.
Thank you.
Your honor,
this is Jackie Lemancyzk's
actual senior claims manual,
and within it, there is
an executive memorandum
entitled section "U."
I ask that I might
approach--
objection, your honor.
Approach the bench?
Your honor, we were not
given a complete manual.
Your honor,
this document contains
executive memoranda
that are stolen work papers
and may not be admitted.
May not be admitted?
Can you prove this, Leo?
Your honor, I ask that you
instruct my colleague here
not to read from
nor to make reference
to any suspect--
I don't understand
why this is not admissible.
It was not proffered
at the correct time,
nor do we know
how it was obtained--
I just found out
about this last night.
Assuming that I can't
get this in now,
do you have any more
questions for the witness?
No, your honor.
You may cross-examine,
Mr. Drummond.
Thank you.
Is it true,
Miss Lemancyzk...
That you have recently
been committed
to an institution
for various problems?
I was not committed.
I am suffering from
alcoholism and depression,
and I voluntarily
checked into a facility.
I was supposed
to be covered
by my group policy
at Great Benefit,
and they, of course,
are denying my claim.
Is that why you're here,
Miss Lemancyzk?
Because you're angry
with Great Benefit?
Miss Lemancyzk?
I hate Great Benefit
and most of the worms
that work there.
Did you feel
Mr. Lufkin was a worm
when you were
sleeping with him?
Objection.
Your honor,
Mr. Drummond might find this
fun to talk about,
but this is
not relevant at all.
Oh, there's
no fun for me.
Overruled.
Let's see
where this takes us.
You admit to having
an affair with Mr. Lufkin?
Miss Lemancyzk?
As long as I had sex
with certain executives
at Great Benefit,
my pay was increased,
and I was promoted.
When I stopped,
I was demoted.
Miss Lemancyzk,
as an employee
of Great Benefit,
you promised
not to disclose
confidential private
claims information.
Yes?
Yes.
In fact, you testified
that you sealed
that promise
by demand of payment
for $10,000, didn't you?
That payment
was not my idea.
But you accepted it,
didn't you?
You put it right
in your pocketbook.
Even though
in your mind,
you never intended
to keep that promise.
In fact,
you were very angry
at Great Benefit and
Mr. Lufkin, weren't you?
You know,
they preyed on me,
because I was broke,
and I was single,
and I had 2 kids.
So you told him you're
gonna go to his wife,
go to the newspapers.
And that $10,000,
that was just a piece
of blackmail, wasn't it?
A way to extort money
from the company you hated!
Isn't that right?
No, that's not true.
In fact, your testimony
here today is just a lie.
You stole
company work papers,
confidential reports
as blackmail for revenge.
Hell hath no fury
as what, Miss Lemancyzk?
A woman scorned!
Your honor, I move
that all documents
provided the plaintiff
by Miss Jackie Lemancyzk
be deemed
stolen work papers
and struck
from these proceedings.
Based on the evidence
presently before the court,
these documents
are inadmissible.
Ohh.
No further questions.
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.
Mr. Baylor.
You may step down,
Miss Lemancyzk.
I'm sorry.
Hello.
Hi. This is Deck Schifflet.
I need to speak to big rhino.
Can you connect me?
Big rhino?
Just a second.
OK.
Hello?
Hey, boss, it's deck.
Oh, hey, deck,
how you doing?
Good. How are you?
Well, I'm cool.
Are you here?
Well,
I'm here and there.
Ah, yeah,
here and there.
Listen, I got
a stolen-evidence situation.
OK. Stolen evidence,
uh...
Let me see, uh...
OK. The De Soto case.
De Soto?
Carmine De Soto.
You remember him?
Club Ruby.
Uh-huh.
Where--where do I find that?
Uh, around '92,
you'll find it, uh,
let's see,
650 something, uh...
Southwest second.
Boss, you're a lifesaver.
'92?
Yeah. Club Ruby case.
'92...
Carmine De Soto.
Carmine De Soto.
Club Ruby.
Club Ruby.
It's from
the appellate court.
Yeah.
It kind of rings a bell.
I got it!
And from Bruiser,
of all people.
Bruiser? I thought you didn't
know where Bruiser was.
Well, I don't, but I got
an emergency-contact number.
I call them, they get me
in touch with him.
Look, Rudy,
nobody knows more than Bruiser
about stolen evidence.
You might say
it's his stock and trade.
Hello?
Mr. Rudy Baylor?
Yes.
This is
the Shelby county D.A.
Can you come
to the courthouse tonight?
I'd like to discuss
the Kelly Riker case.
Sure.
Come to room 6.
There's an advantage to dealing
with pimps and thieves.
In the case of<i> Carmine De Soto</i>
<i>vs. The Club Ruby,</i>
there are reams
of stolen evidence.
Now, Bruiser worked
on this stuff himself.
Not now.
I got to go.
You got to go?
You got the CEO of Great Benefit
coming in tomorrow.
We--we got to nail this guy,
come on.
Good luck, Kelly.
Thanks.
I met with the D.A.
She's not
gonna prosecute.
Said she'd never
get a conviction.
It was self-defense,
Kelly.
The plaintiff
would like to call
Wilfred Keeley
to the stand.
Raise your
right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony
you're about to give
in this cause
will be the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?
I do.
You may take the stand.
State your name
for the record.
Wilfred Keeley.
May I approach
the witness, your honor?
You may.
Mr. Keeley, uh, in this
Great Benefit brochure,
is that you?
Is that your name?
Yes.
And what do
those initials stand for?
CEO?
Yeah. What do they stand for?
What does "CEO" mean?
Chief executive officer.
Chief executive officer.
Thank you, thank you.
So you're the--
you're the guy.
You're the main guy,
you're the cheese.
The buck stops with you.
You could say that, yes.
Yeah. OK. Thank you.
Uh, your honor, I'd like
to turn the questioning
of Mr. Keeley over
to my partner Rudy Baylor.
Are you out of your mind?
You don't have a license.
I didn't have a choice.
What are you doing?
You're late.
Good morning, your honor.
Sorry I'm late, sir.
Approach the witness,
your honor?
You may.
This is the claims manual
that was given to me
by Jackie Lemancyzk.
Objection,
your honor.
Stolen work papers.
Inadmissible.
You ruled on this.
Sustained.
May we approach?
I thought this matter
was already settled, your honor.
Your honor,
I just this morning
found a case
that is controlled
in this
factual situation.
What do you have?
If you'll just take
a look at this ruling.
It's<i> Club Ruby</i>
<i>vs. Carmine De Soto.</i>
Copy for your honor
and one for Mr. Drummond.
Number 585,
southwest second, page 431,
argued by Bruiser--
by J. Lyman Stone.
And it shows very clearly
that stolen documents
are, in fact, admissible
if the lawyers played
no part in the theft.
Well, according
to these head notes,
this case will overrule
your objection.
Sorry, Leo.
Oh, I'm sure you are,
your honor.
But note
my strong objection.
Objection noted.
May I approach?
Do so.
Uh...Your honor...
Your honor, I'm sorry.
Excuse the interruption,
Mr. Keeley.
We were about
to talk about
the Great Benefit
claims manual.
Is that a complete Great Benefit
claims manual, sir?
Yes.
Does it have
a section "U"?
It has
a section "U" in it.
Well, let's talk about
this mysterious section "U."
Why don't we explain it
to the jury?
Take a look at it.
Just read paragraph 3.
"Claim handlers are directed
to deny all claims
"within 3 days
of receipt of claim.
No exceptions."
Now, how do you explain
this section "U"?
Well, sometimes
we get some frivolous
and fraudulent claims
in our business,
and sometimes we have to use
this kind of language
to focus in on
the legitimate
and more needy claims.
Mr. Keeley, do you honestly
expect this court
to believe that explanation?
Well, this chapter
merely denotes
in-house
processing guidelines.
In-house
<i>processing</i> guidelines.
No, Mr. Keeley.
No, it does not.
Section "U" does
a lot more than that.
I don't think
it does that, son.
Mr. Keeley, doesn't it
explain precisely
how claims should be routed
and shuffled and rerouted,
anything to avoid payment?
I admit nothing.
Your honor,
approach the witness?
You may.
Now, Mr. Keeley,
how many policies did
Great Benefit have in effect
in the year 1995?
I don't know.
Well, let's see.
Does the figure 98,000 sound
correct, give or take a few?
Maybe.
That could be right,
yeah.
Thank you.
Now, of these policies,
how many claims were filed?
Well, I don't--
I don't know that.
Does the figure of 11,400
sound correct to you,
give or take a few?
That's about right,
but I'd have to
verify it, of course.
I see. So the information
that I want
is right there in that book?
Yes.
Can you tell the jury
of the 11 some odd thousand
claims filed,
how many were denied?
I don't think I could.
That would take more time.
You've had 2 months,
Mr. Keeley.
Now answer the question.
Well, I...
I don't think...
Um...
"9,141."
11,462 filed.
9,141 denied.
Your honor...
I have yet another document.
This is a report
from Great Benefit's
medical committee.
Request permission
under previous precedent
to present it to Mr. Keeley.
Same objection,
your honor.
Overruled.
Objection noted.
Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Keeley,
that is a report
from Great Benefit's
own medical committee,
which you chaired.
Would you please read
from line 18?
"Since bone-marrow
transplants
"have become
standard procedure,
"Great Benefit would be
financially justified
in investing
in bone-marrow clinics."
Approach the witness,
your honor?
You may.
Thank you.
There you go.
A little louder.
Objection,
your honor. Repetitious.
Overruled.
I want the jury
to hear this.
"Since
bone-marrow transplants
"have become
standard procedure,
"Great Benefit would be
financially justified
in investing
in bone-marrow clinics."
Financially justified.
That's what it's all about
at Great Benefit, isn't it?
Tender the witness.
Mr. Drummond.
No questions. We rest
on our objections.
You're excused, Mr. Keeley.
Thank you.
Rudy.
Hmm?
Come on. Get up.
Come on. It's time.
Let's go.
Come on, come on.
What will giving a judgment
of $10 million accomplish?
All insurance company premiums
will spin out of reach,
and it will pave the way
for government-controlled
health coverage.
Yours is
a grave responsibility.
Be wise,
be careful,
and be just.
Be just.
Thank you, your honor.
Mr. Baylor, your rebuttal.
Thank you, your honor.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...
When I think
of Donny Ray Black...
Gasping for his last breath
of air and slowly dying...
I am disgusted
with myself...
And with the entire
legal profession
that could not save him.
I don't even feel good enough
about myself as a lawyer
to make my own summation.
So I thought I'd...
I'd let Donny Ray do that.
It's exhibit 16.
I weigh 110 pounds.
11 months ago,
I weighed 160.
The leukemia was detected
in plenty of time.
I was in the hospital
being treated
when the doctors realized
that the only thing
that could save my life
would be
a bone-marrow transplant.
So, I got released
from the hospital,
'cause my family
couldn't afford to pay
the bill for what
they had recommended.
Why?
Great Benefit insurance
denied our claim.
Come on.
It's OK.
If I had had
a bone-marrow transplant,
I would have had
a 90% chance of living.
I hope that you are
astonished...
As I am,
at the lengths to which
a wealthy insurance company,
like the defendant,
will go to take money
from a low-income family
and then keep it
by denying
a legitimate claim.
It's no wonder they spend
so much money on their lawyers
and their lobbyists and
their public relations machine
to convince us we need
tort reform,
that we need to put an end
to punitive damages.
I'm asking you, the jury...
Just...
Do what you think is right
in your hearts.
If you don't punish
Great Benefit...
You could be
their next victim.
That's it.
don't be nervous.
Has the jury
reached a verdict?
Yes, we have,
your honor.
Is it written on paper,
according to my instructions?
Yes, sir.
Please read the verdict.
"We, the jury,
find for the plaintiff
"and award actual damages
in the amount
of $150,000."
"And we, the jury,
find for the plaintiff
"and award
punitive damages
in the amount
of $50 million."
All rise.
These people were
trying to hide things
and trying to get away with
something they were, uh...
And they got caught at it.
Another remarkable
part of the story--
the lead attorney on the case
Rudy Baylor
was trying his first case.
That's a staggering verdict,
I think,
by anybody's estimation.
It's certainly
one of the largest...
Well, not bad
for a yard boy.
Well, it wasn't
that difficult, really.
We just had a great jury
is what we had,
and the facts
just fell into place.
$50 million
in punitive damages.
$50 million?
Yeah.
How much do you get?
You get right
to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry.
It's not what I meant.
I know you didn't.
We get 1/3, but the money's
not in the bank yet.
I'll see you later.
You gonna leave
this girl all alone?
Not for long.
Rudy. Rudy.
I've decided I'm gonna
put your name in my will.
Oh. You know what?
You are just too kind
to me, Miss Birdie.
Hot off the newswire.
"Mr. Wilfred Keeley,
CEO of Great Benefit,
"was detained
yesterday afternoon at JFK
"just after boarding a flight
bound for Heathrow.
"Traveling with his wife,
"they claimed to be sneaking
away for a quick holiday.
"However, they could not
produce the name of a hotel
anywhere in Europe..."
At which they were expected.
At 5 P.M. today,
insurance company Great Benefit
filed for protection
under the bankruptcy code
in federal court
in Cleveland.
Many states are now
investigating Great Benefit,
and a number of class-action
lawsuits have been filed.
Hello?
Rudy, Leo Drummond here.
It appears the company's
been looted.
I'm--I'm sorry, Rudy.
I wanted you to get
every penny of that money.
Everybody loses
on this one.
Wanted you to know.
Thank you, Mr. Drummond.
Great Benefit's like
a bad slot machine--
never pays off.
We should have
taken 175,000.
What the hell
were we thinking?
It just got all
twisted, didn't it?
This legal profession.
Every lawyer in America
is talking about me
right now,
but that doesn't exactly
make me feel
like a member
of the legal community.
I might be able
to go on practicing law
if I was working
with my whole heart,
but I can't do that
and cover Kelly.
And she's gonna need
a lot of cover for a while.
I still love the law.
I'll always love it,
but maybe I should be
teaching it
instead of practicing it
out here in the world.
I need time to work it out.
Great Benefit
has gone belly up.
Barring a miracle
way off in the distance,
we won't get a dime.
God.
You've put them
out of business, Dot.
One little woman
from Memphis, Tennessee,
bankrupted them
sons of bitches?
Oh.
I'm gonna go to Donny Ray's
grave tomorrow
and tell him all about it.
So, I guess Kelly and I
will be taking off
first thing in the morning.
We made history, Rudy.
You know that?
We can always brag.
Bye.
There's no doubt
about it--I'm hot.
In fact, I'm so hot
after this case,
there's no place for me
to go but down.
See ya.
Every client I ever have
will expect this--
the same magic,
nothing less.
And I could probably
give it to them,
if it didn't matter
how I did it.
And then one morning,
I'd wake up and find
that I'd become Leo Drummond.
Now, you give me a call
when you pass the bar exam.
Yeah, piece of cake!
Every lawyer,
at least once in every case,
feels himself crossing a line
he doesn't really mean to cross.
It just happens.
And if you cross it
enough times,
it disappears forever.
And then you're nothing
but another lawyer joke,
just another shark
in the dirty water.
