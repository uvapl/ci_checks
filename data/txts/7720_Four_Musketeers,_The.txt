THE FOUR MUSKETEERS
I remember when young D'Artagnan
was made a Musketeer to the king.
Splendid ceremony, you know.
All the best people,
creamed of French society.
I was there, off course.
Who but I, with Aramis and Athos could
put the tabard on D'Artagnan shoulder?
It is important for a young
man rising in the world...
should be seen to have a
worthy and well sponsored.
It gives people confidence.
And the king approved.
And the Queen, as well she might.
But was it not D'Artagnan, Aramis,
Athos and I would save her reputation.
And prevented her love affair with
the Duke of Buckingham from scandal.
Stupid woman, you see,
becoming infatuated...
with an Englishman and an
English Prime Minister as well.
D'Artagnan...
deserved his reward.
The four had risked our skin
and reputation on her behalf...
against perilous enemies.
The Cardinal Richelieu for one.
A formidable man and hungry for power.
Who would've exposed and ruined
the Queen to serve his own ambition.
No gentleman, you see.
His agents were Milady de Winter
and her lover, Rochefort,
two birds of prey in fine feathers.
She would never forgive D'Artagnan...
or his mistress Constance for
defeating her plot against the Queen.
Revenge was what Milady wanted.
A dreadful woman.
But what did we care for her
or Rochefort or Cardinal?
We were young and carefree,
as Musketeers should be.
And D'Artagnan was in
love with his dressmaker.
And there was work, fighting in service
against the Protestants of La Rochelle.
We tried to teach the rebels
the meaning of Christian charity,
by bombarding them into surrender.
These thugs with the idea of
a working class as a religion!
Even our old enemy Rochefort,
the Cardinal's jackal blade...
is spying for us inside
the walls of La Rochelle.
Unsuccesfully, you see.
Fortunately for him, we three played
our part, disdain is what I thought.
Rescue a spy, no gentleman. Leave
him where he is, if I had my way.
- This is enough for him.
- We did not know how many.
Yes, you did.
Return your stick!
Put in bullets!
Shake the rod load!
Recover your muskets!
Light the wick!
Blow off your coal!
Cock your musket!
Has Porthos got the horses ready?
Yes.
Has he got the horses ready?
Yes!
Blindfold!
Place the muskets!
Perhaps I could close one eye.
Poise your muskets!
Now!
The bomb! Quickly!
Open the look!
The fuse, Athos! The fuse!
Present!
Fire!
Damn fools!
Can't you even shoot a man?
Reload!
Why bother?
I may died of old age.
Get on the horse, Rochefort!
Hurry!
- You arrive just in time!
- Who hurries to rescue a spy?
Seal off our escape!
The gate!
Yes, right.
Aramis!
Go under if you can!
Hit it now! Like that!
No, again! Again!
I'd rather die than have to
bring you this news, Your Majesty.
The rebels would not surrender,
they expect a fleet...
...to aid them under
the Duke of Buckingham.
- I'd rather I die.
- I would rather.
We would all rather.
- I owe my life, Your Majesty.
- I don't want it!
I don't want those stories either.
I want to make a triumphant
entry to La Rochelle.
- Duke of Buckingham covet my Queen.
- No, Sire.
He wants La Rochelle,
he will assist the rebels.
But your Queen is
not a traitor to France.
- Not to France. To me.
- But Your Majesty is France.
Tell the rabble which leaves
not to storm La Rochelle.
Time will shatter those walls, Majesty.
La Rochelle will fall.
But it is boring,
battling away day after day.
Sire,
Shall we siege on here while
Your Majesty returns to Paris...
to your Queen, your faithfull Queen?
Leave this dirty business to us.
It is dirty business, and the
Queen is a traitor to my bed.
You should think yourself lucky.
I can place my musketeers in
danger to help you out of there.
I shall not do it again, spy. If you
have another eye, you might see why.
Good, I like that.
The gratitude of princes.
Spy? It is a foul word.
It is a familiar word to me,
Eminence, in your service.
To your knees, little man,
before your master!
Now hear me, Rochefort.
The Queen sends letter of love
to Buckingham. She should not.
Not while Buckingham
sends fleet against France.
I would have you stop these letters,
by stopping their girl between.
The woman Bonacieux,
Queen's dressmaker.
You will remove her, my son.
This time do not
require me to rescue you.
She is, after all, only a woman.
I tell you, that goose is tender, sir.
See? Now, say you're sorry.
You don't want it.
My mother says that only well
can you tell if fresh.
Peaches!
Are they not beautiful?
Beside you, Constance my dear,
they look old and wrinkled.
Melons!
Clumsy clown.
Whose going to pay for them?
D'Artagnan?
D'Artagnan!
Away with her.
Stand up and fight, you coward!
Poor, poor gentleman.
Rene!
Come, lift him into to coach.
But, gently.
He's hurt.
But Constance...
Be still.
I should take care of you.
Really, Kitty. He's a
most handsome young man.
- You are awake, sir?
- Who are you?
A friend.
Constance's melons!
- I have to go!
- You are being foolish.
I must find Constance.
Please forgive me.
Such kindness to a stranger.
Sir!
You are not well. Trully.
You should lie down.
Should.
No. But I will be back...
to thank you properly.
A most handsome young man.
If he's bleeding lot of blood
in the gutter, I'd have my way.
And you are a friend.
You know what he'd say if he knew we
had his dressmaker under lock and key?
So much beauty wasted in
a ridiculous musketeer.
I merely obey the Cardinal's
orders and keep him occupied.
Isn't that all the Cardinal wants?
You do have a habit
to enjoying your work.
What do you say, Lord Buckingham?
If God intended us to swim underwater,
he would giving us fins.
If I go to break the siege of La
Rochelle, we shall go with ships.
Well...
This under sea boat of yours
is an ingenious invention,
but how many carts of salt beef
can you carry to the rebels?
How many big guns can you take
to blow old Richelieu to hell?
We're coming!
But this boat is big enough
to steal the Queen of France.
I do not need to steal
the Queen of France. / No.
When the time is ripe,
we shall be together.
My dear sweet Anne...
Stupid priests!
Stupid Protestants!
Three weeks sneezing in the rain
at La Rochelle, and for what?
The best of my wardrobe
still on its way back to Paris.
These religious wars. Beatrice,
I could lose all patience!
- Perhaps, Majesty, this one...
- No!
That makes me like a burst cushion.
Constance will just have to
make me a new one. Where is she?
- Where's the Queen's dressmaker?
- Constance is not to be found.
What do you mean?
She has not been seen for
two days. Not here or home.
She has, gone.
The Cardinal.
Beatrice, what have they done with her?
But where? Where?
You say they kidnapped her under
your nose? And only four of them?
Lose ones mistress in the
conventional way is bad enough,
but to have her carried off
like a basket of washing...
that's careless, almost bad taste!
Especially when one has paying
attention to a beautiful, great Milady.
Your poor Madame Bonacieux
would probably prefers to stay...
with the kidnappers.
Mine mistresses would,
If I treated her so.
Aramis! Aramis!
Observe my new trick!
My opponent is there, about
to unsheathe, when suddenly...
Oh, Porthos.
Try it again.
Only Porthos could invent a
new way of disarming himself.
Will you never learn?
Kidnap her? Why?
Not even listening.
- It was a scientific experiment!
- Athos, are you hurt?
What I am is drunk.
What you are, sir,
troubled.
Child, you are troubled.
What's the matter?
It's my mistress. She was
snatched from my side... / Good.
Has you discovered their hiding place?
- No.
- Good!
I am told that you have
found another. / No!
Porthos told me.
Now, is Porthos a liar?
No.
He speaks to me of a certain
milady who lead you by the hand.
No, no, no!
I love her with my head.
But my Constance, snatched from
my side, I love with my heart.
You have a conveniently
discriminating anatomy.
Who would've thought you kept your
heart swung there so you might lose it?
Why, you shriveled old winesack!
Have you never lost your heart?
Me? No.
Never. But I knew a man
once who did. But me, never.
Hear this love story.
There was this man.
This noble man...
who lost his heart. He loved
a girl who came from nothing.
came with beauty as beautiful as,
whatever you think is beautiful.
And he was a great man.
Without fear, he taken her.
But he was a great man because he
was a man of honor. So he married her.
Knowing not whence she came.
He gave her his name,
as well his love...
...with honor.
One day, hunting,
she was trip from the horse.
And there in the full light of day...
he saw her naked shoulder.
He saw the branded mark of harlot.
A thief, placed there.
His angel bore his name and
the mark of dishonor together.
Whore, murderers or worst
burned into her shoulder.
He...
saw it.
He...
What?
I think that she is...
...dead.
I would hope she died, wouldn't you?
Poor man.
Poor dishonored man.
Well!
That's the story to cure your love.
It takes a love story
to cure you of love.
Of fascinating women.
Tell me something. Is your
Milady as beautiful as the dew?
She's as magnificent as
summer's dew. As that.
I'd beg of you, forget her,
she will do you some mischief.
Yes, you're right. And besides,
I owe it to my Constance.
I shall remain faithful to her.
- Monsieur D'Artagnan!
- Kitty! Your mistress is well today?
- Well indeed, sir, but not here.
- Not here? But she said four o'clock.
Yes, but before four she went
out, to take the air. / The air?
Why would she do that?
What a pretty flower!
She doesn't love you at all.
She told you that?
Oh, no. But, I have seen
Milady and men before.
But why do you tell me this?
- Because I have my own interest.
- You? You, Kitty?
But of course, what
else could one expect?
Dear child.
Now then, we have ten
minutes before Milady return.
We're here.
Thank you, Milady.
Bloody arm.
Kitty?
- She has put a weight on.
- Why didn't she get a horse?
Kitty?
Kitty!
- Were you asleep?
- I was resting.
Thank you.
- Has our Gascon been and gone?
- No, Milady.
He did not come.
Perhaps with the army going to La
Rochelle, he's been detained by duty.
Possibly. It maybe necesarry to
teach Monsieur D'Artagnan manners,
before we've done with him.
- What will you do with him, Milady?
- Who should say?
It was pleasant to be
adore by one so pretty.
In time, Rochefort will
cut him to death by inches.
Perhaps I should watch.
As for his dressmaker...
Rochefort grooms will have her.
I should wear this tonight.
Stay there!
Thank you!
No...
Where is Constance Bonacieux?
Quickly! Unless you want this bed to be
your deathbed. Where is she? / Wait.
Try that again and I'll cut some
fleur de lis and the rest of you!
- Quickly, Kitty! Give me that cloak!
- Kitty! Open the door!
But...
Excuse me, sir.
Stop! Come back, sir!
Kitty opens the door!
I think your mistress is calling.
But that's the window...
Hello, hello.
Hey.
- Thank you, Madame.
- Move along, please.
Kitty!
Oh, well.
Kitty! Open the door!
Bad luck, Aramis!
Shoe shine! Anyone
wants shoes shine, sir?
Shoe shine?
- D'Artagnan! Lend me some money!
- Wine!
I need some wine!
Ah, thank you.
Where did you get this?
Milady.
Your story,
the brand of fleur de lis...
It was her?
Oh God.
I'd hoped that she was dead.
This has been in our family for
generations before I gave it to her.
Those other two must
not know, alright? / Yes.
So she has return to haunt me.
And you.
Because you've done something she'll
never forgive. You found out her secret.
She won't let you live, boy.
She has tried in that line already.
Leave now.
Leave Paris, leave France. Get as far
from that evil woman's grasp as you can.
How about you?
I'm safe. She does not
know that Athos exist.
If you stay, your life will be
worthless. Do you understand?
No. You forget, there's
still Constance to be found.
That tumbling trot of a dressmaker?
If you please! I love her.
I think.
I shall ask the Queen
for help in finding her.
And as for the branded
lady and her vengeance:
Our regiment leaves again for La Rochelle
tomorrow. That's far enough to be safe.
- Where away, musketeer?
- The Queen.
Her Majesty isn't receiving,
but the Cardinal is.
D'Artagnan of Gascony.
You'd been describe as a swordsman.
That is kindness.
- As an intriguer.
- There's that, in all of us.
- As an enemy.
- I'm honored to have you as an enemy.
I?
I have no enemies.
Only those in France.
But I do seem to be continually
beset by enemies who wear your coat.
You wear my coat.
Serve France, as I do.
I'm offering you a
commissioned in my guard.
These enemies are the
enemies of France.
Root them out under my protection.
Wear my coat. Have my love.
Eminence, what can I say?
"Yes" will be sufficient.
I can't.
You're very wet.
Wet or dry, I cannot.
Take my hand. Your fortune
is secured. / No, I can't!
I do not withdraw my hand.
It is held out to you openly.
In it lies your future.
Take it.
No.
Are you going to the siege
of La Rochelle? / I do.
You will find it a perilous journey.
I bear you no ill will,
- But I can give you no protection.
- I asked for none.
I shall not lift a finger to save you.
I deeply regret that I can
not accept your service.
I don't make such an
offer twice in one day.
But if you should survive
to return to Paris,
you may see my hand stretched
out to you once more.
For then, you would be a very
remarkable young man indeed.
I would remark on it to people.
Goodbye.
The young fool refused Richelieu
offer of a commissioned.
Which now makes him fair
game as far as your concern.
He's conceit.
No!
We should oblige D'Artagnan & make sure
that his journey is an eventful one.
That's easily arrange.
The Musketeers regiment
leave Paris tomorrow.
They serve as couriers on
their march to La Rochelle.
D'Artagnan and his friends
frequently travel in small groups.
There should be no difficulty
to entertain them along the road.
Excelent. And the woman, Bonacieux?
The lady is enjoying the hospitality
of my guards at my chateau Saint-Cloud.
It would seem they are
most anxious to pander...
to her creature comfort.
So she is in safe hands.
Never fear.
The Queen will need a new dressmaker
whenever you agree to say so.
At Saint-Cloud?
I know he'll kill her,
if Milady says so.
And she'll do anything
to bill revenge on you.
I'll have her out of here this night.
- But where can I take her to safety?
- To the convent of Armentières.
But Rochefort's men are
sure to be expecting you.
Let us rescue your mistress. It's the
very least one can do for a friend.
If she can stay with the Sisters
while we're at La Rochelle...
I'm sure they'll learn a
great deal from each other.
I'll cover for you and we will
meet again within three days.
See if you can find a way to
console yourself until our return.
Aramis!
Forgive me!
Don't let him get the key!
Do not let him get it!
We need it!
Go to the window!
Hello, my dear. Would you like
to climb on my shoulders?
There he is!
Come on, my dear.
Quickly, here we are.
- Yes!
- Sister. Be good.
The problems of the siege of
La Rochelle has been immense.
Mainly because nobody
would listen to me.
For example:
I should deploy the
siege towers at dawn.
No, no. Before dawn.
Good evening. See any
musketeers yet? / Not yet.
There's a parcel of letter for
you on the table. They came today.
Unfortunately, my superiors...
do not appreciate my strategy.
Love, your...
What's it say?
This writing is bound to be
indistinct. Perhaps you could...
"Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Monsieur Athos, Porthos and Aramis...
arrived at my inn."
It's from the innkeeper of Villoix.
"And having dine & drunk, became noisy,
the marshal lock them up for a few days.
They asked me to send you a dozen bottle
of my Anjou wine to drink their health."
Now, that's what I call real friendship.
To think of me when they're drunk.
No. The least I can do is to bail
them out, and we drink these together.
What did I do?
Who the devil would fight
out of door in this weather?
- Only a lunatic.
- D'Artagnan might be involved?
Anyone else on this road?
That one.
And there.
Don't worry. I'm coming. I help...
- Take me with you!
- Out of my way!
Help me!
Are you hurt?
- No, no.
- Good, come along.
Aramis, this one is still alive.
We'll take him with us.
He can sing us a song about
Milady's plot, no doubt.
What about me?
I might've freeze!
- What do you think?
- Nothing.
We were supposed to go to Red
Dovecote inn near La Rochelle.
Oh, God, my arm!
I know nothing more, I swear! No names!
Planchet!
- Brandy!
- Come on, now! Bustle!
Here's your wine of Anjou.
That will do.
A drink, in the name of God. A drink.
Am I to die of thirst and
cold while this footpad cuddle?
- What? Are you mad?
- Look!
I always had my doubts
about the Anjou '22.
- Where did this wine come from?
- Why, you sent them!
It came today with a note
from the landlord of Villoix.
- We sent you no wine.
- But we can guess who did.
An ambush on the road.
Poisoned wine.
It occurs to me that
Milady is tenacious.
The sooner we get to the field
Battle of La Rochelle, the better.
Red Dovecote inn.
- I think they're disgusting.
- Do try one, Majesty.
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.
Look down on these sinners hanging.
Cardinal!
- La Rochelle has fallen, eh?
- Not quite, Sire.
The pigeon has reach
the Dovecote, Eminence.
Eminence!
Yes, it's here.
Either your priestly intention
above all the saint on your side,
or you're cheating.
- It is a matter of faith.
- Your faith is costing me money.
All this evening spend at this place,
just because a rascal mention its name.
What are we waiting?
Richelieu!
What the devil does he want here?
- No one knows you're here?
- The landlord has been well paid.
Yes. How, Milady.
What you will do for your pay:
A ship waiting at the river mouth.
You will board it tonight. In London...
you will urge the Duke of Buckingham
not to assist the rebels.
No food, no aid, no
English fleet to the rescue.
Assure him from me, that if he does,
he is at war with France, a war
he dare not fight, can not win.
More than that,
The Queen of France,
for whom he bears love...
my word on this, as sure as I love, will
be dragged out and paraded in dishonor.
And if he will not heed you?
Then we must pray that the
Duke mixed with an accident.
I see.
Naturally, you will
urge him to see wisdom.
Bon voyage, Milady.
I'm not to be paid in money.
You are not?
I have affairs to be settled.
I'm not concerned with your affairs.
I would wish it.
I'm not concerned with
your wishes, Milady.
But you may name your
own price, obviously.
A death.
I will not assist in
your private murders.
I need no assistance.
I need only your signature that I might
have carte blanche, a signed warrant...
for disposal of the life of the
slut Bonacieux and her lover.
No.
Eminence.
The death of Buckingham for the
death of D'Artagnan. Their lives...
for the sake of France.
- Well?
- Find D'Artagnan and stay with him.
And you?
- I'll follow as soon as I can.
- Be careful.
What do you want? Who are you?
How dare you?
The Gascon was right.
You're still beautiful.
Comte de la Fere!
Oh, no, milady.
The Comte de la Fere has died.
You killed me years ago.
Do you remember?
Hunting in the field.
On a summer's day.
I'm so stigmatized like you.
What do you want of me?
There's nothing between us.
Thank God.
But there might be, you see.
I know you.
I know what past here, just now.
And you mark this.
You kill Buckingham or have him
killed, it's no matter to me.
He's an Englishman and an enemy.
But you touch one hair
of D'Artagnan's head...
and I swear, as God is my judge, I'll
break you on the wheel with my own hand.
No.
Monsieur D'Artagnan...
has assaulted me, insulted me...
Since when has it been possible
to insult you, Madame?
And he will die for it.
Have you ever seen a
woman shot in the stomach?
You know me, Milady.
Give me the papers the
Cardinal wrote just now.
I'll give you five seconds.
Very well.
One, two,
three, four...
"By my order and for
the good of the state,
the bearer has done what
has been done. Richelieu. "
Clever and subtle man,
our dear Cardinal.
It gives you what you want without
leaving evidence against himself.
Unfortunately you won't have time to
send messages before your ship leaves.
Bon voyage.
The outer bastion is cleared of rebels.
But it's to hot to hold.
Fairly seven o'clock.
We'll try a full frontal
assault at nine. Or at ten.
- A musketeer! Where have you been?
- Good day, gentlemen.
Boy! Quickly!
- Look here!
- Get off!
Thank you very much.
Where is the Gascon?
We have to speak to him, quickly.
Over there, in the trenches.
A conference? But where?
We can't keep a secret here.
The eyes and ears around here
belongs to the Cardinal.
Right. Where can we go?
More work, gentlemen.
And where were the musketeers?
At our prayes, sir.
Like good christians.
So as I, and for a good reason.
That bastion was buzzing
like a beehive.
And yet, you did not
stay for to breakfast.
Neither would you.
Would you bet on that?
I'll wager you...
the finest dinner on this camp, we
will have breakfast on that bastion...
now.
Done! Done!
You hear that, Spengler. We're going to
eat that big dinner alone. /What is it?
Our good friend Athos, proposed to
have us killed for breakfast. Up there.
Planchet! Bring bread, four chickens,
ham, oysters and wine. Right now!
And make the wine champagne.
For breakfast? Oh, my dear Porthos!
- Planchet! Money, money, money...
- You can't afford some!
- Thistles!
- A long way to go for breakfast!
Is not that right, Athos?
Over there! Don't you see? Someone
approaches the bastion! Fire!
Hurry! I'll cover you! Quick!
There!
Take cover, Planchet!
All right?
Why do we always have to attack uphill?
I'm getting too old for this.
I got something important to
tell you! / You have to speak up!
You three up there!
Get those things ready!
At last, we got the
cance to talk in peace.
Here is your wine, now.
It's an ideal temperature.
Come on. Open it, Planchet!
Damned pirate landlord!
This isn't champagne!
This wine does not travel well.
You saw her with the Cardinal?
And she's going to murder Buckingham?
If necessary. And knowing Buckingham,
it probably will be. Give me some!
A moment, gentlemen!
We're in the middle of our breakfast!
Barbarians, have they no manners?
We can't allow Buckingham to be
butchered! / Why? He is on their side.
Precisely. And he's English!
No! He's a gallant gentleman.
And he loves our Queen.
I won't sit by and allow
him to be murdered by that...
She also has a death warrant signed
against you and Madame Bonacieux.
Here, read this with your breakfast
and tuck it safely in your boot.
Fire!
Wrong.
It would be better to wringing Milady
than shooting these devils Protestants.
What are we killing them for? Because
they sing psalms in French & we in Latin?
Porthos, have you no education? What do
you think religious wars are all about?
Here they come!
Make your shot count!
Hurry up, Planchet.
Load that.
Come on, Planchet.
Use both hands.
A loaf of bread!
Mine!
What a waste!
I do apologize.
Quick, here! The wall!
Push! Push for your lives!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Push, Porthos! Exert yourself!
Athos! About Buckingham, I ought
to warn the Queen! / Later!
Gentlemen, I suggest
we get out of here!
Take!
Thank you very much, sir.
Could you give me a hand?
Can you help?
The basket.
Can you?
Take for it!
Come back soon. Don't get killed.
Come back and pay it,
or we will find you.
Nice to see them back again.
Here we are. / Well done,
D'Artagnan. And Athos, come.
It know it against our
principles, but have a drink!
And Aramis! Even you. Well done.
Here's your money. Now go and
fill your fat royalist belly.
Your journey has been in vain.
Inform His Eminence, I'm not to be
persuaded by his threats or beauty.
I will take English ships to help
the Protestants of La Rochelle.
Tell the Cardinal.
I trust you do not live to
regret it, Milord Buckingham.
Trust to the Cardinal to employ
every diplomatic argument.
At least it relieves my conscience
of any doubts in assisting the rebels.
I shall inform His Eminence.
Lady, you'll inform no one!
You came here as an ambassadress, but
by God, you'll stay here as an assassin!
- You will not dare.
- Oh, no?
A week lodging in a congenial
riverside establishment. The tower.
And after I've sails with my fleet
to France, you will set sails to.
To His Majesty's colony in America.
America!
They say it is full
of beautiful savages.
Who knows, once there, maybe
you'll be able to use that...
astonishing beauty to persuade
someone to bring you home again.
But don't count on it, in the meantime.
I have a jailer for you who can't see
beauty even when it is astonished you.
He can't be melted. Felton!
Milord?
Milady is going to the tower, Felton.
At your charge.
She is to see no one else.
Good sir?
In this place, may I be granted
the comfort of Gods words?
A Bible. And the Psalms.
Are you not a Roman?
No.
No, sir.
I am a Huguenot. Those were prosecuted
for their Protestant's faith.
This is mine.
I sall bring you the Psalms tomorrow.
God bless you, sir!
The Cardinal sent that
woman to England...
...to kill?
Oh, no.
He must be warn!
- You go, D'Artagnan!
- It not possible, Your Majesty.
I can not leave my regiment with
the Cardinal's spies are everywhere.
But I have a servant to go and warn
Buckingham, if you write a message.
- I owe you so much, D'Artagnan.
- No, Majesty.
Majesty, the King is waiting!
One glad piece of news, I do have.
Constance Bonacieux is safe.
She is at the Cecilia convent,
near Armentieres.
As soon as I'm free of the siege,
I'll go and bring her back to Paris.
Madame, the King!
Save him for me.
God bless you, D'Artagnan.
And please have your servant hurry...
to England.
This is the best I could
get for the money.
Do not let your foot be moved;
or numb the...
Lord is your protector;
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right...
The sun shall not smite you
by day, nor the moon by night.
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.
Jehovah preserve thy going
out and thy coming...
...now and forever.
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.
Do not allow your foot
nor slumber that keepeth thee...
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.
...nor he that keepeth thee slumber.
Behold, he is numb...
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.
When they cry,
the Lord hear it...
and delivers them
from all their troubles.
The Lord is near...
Amen.
Master Felton.
For two nights I do not sleep.
When I am awake, I am nearer to God.
God is with thee,
awake or asleep, Milady.
Help me!
God, help me! Help my
people from prosecution!
Deliver them from the
betrayal, the antichrist,
so as not to corrupt and destroy..
as he has defiled and destroyed me.
Send me thy angel, God...
to strike down Thy enemies!
Help me! Help me!
Who is the antichrist, the betrayal?
Your master, the Duke of Buckingham.
He is the Philistine blight on Israel.
You are a Puritan and yet,
you serve him.
They are dying in La Rochelle for the
faith and he is betraying them. / No!
- No! He's going to save them.
- He deceives the world & will betray.
He marches to Paris, to the bed of
his Queen, his lascivious Roman Queen.
Help me, master Felton.
You have the eyes of a saint.
Help me to warn our people.
I can not think.
Help me.
Felton,
you will not let this
treachery go unpunished.
It is in God's hands.
His will be done. / Yes.
Let it be done.
Then the dragon was
wroth with the women;
and went to make war with
the remnant of her seed.
Aye, ten pence.
Good steel, too.
Your change, sir!
Lord Buckingham!
Seems that Lord Buckingham
not going to leave England.
My congratulations.
I reek of England and Calvinism.
The Cardinal's business is done.
I may devote myself to my own.
To St. Cloud and the woman, Bonacieux.
No. She is in the Cecilia
convent in Armentieres.
One of my men went after her
but the fool bungle it, somewhat.
Sorry.
And D'Artagnan? / La Rochelle
surrendered three days ago.
So, Sire, La Rochelle has fallen.
And not before time.
- What you going to spend, Porthos?
- After paying the drink...
for Athos and Aramis pardons,
will not be too much.
Don't forget the needy.
Come on. Constance is in danger!
They were on the road to
Armentières to claim his lady love.
Don't worry, they can not possibly
be closer than Paris by now.
We may be in Armentières at dawn.
I've twelve men at
the convent already...
so we can assure D'Artagnan
a most heartly welcome.
And you will have them all, Milady.
Welcome, welcome, Musketeers!
These poor beasts are done, Athos.
Not only the poor beasts.
How far is the Cecilia
convent? / Two miles!
Up the Brussels road.
We're almost there.
Time for a glass of wine!
Then we'll escort you to your
heart desire. Wine! Come on!
To quench a Gascon.
Hey, stop!
Quickly!
Athos!
Athos! He's here!
Rochefort! He saw me! Come on!
After him!
Come on! Quick!
After them!
After them! Quick!
There's no saddle on that horse!
There it is!
Steady, Gascon!
There's another way in.
Take her inside! Go to the
barn! They're close behind!
Find the girl!
I'll take care of the riders!
They're coming!
Fire at will!
They come from behind!
Don't let them get away! Fire!
Aramis!
Fire!
Thank you!
Come on, Rochefort!
Come on!
- Aramis!
- Porthos!
Aramis!
Quickly!
...lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...
What is it, sister?
My child.
Have no fear. Keep praying.
- The shooting...
- Will soon be over.
I'm a friend.
Soon you will be free.
- Monsieur D'Artagnan...
- He's here!
He will see you in a moment.
Go on with your prayers.
You should say a prayer for him.
- And the gallant gentelemen with him.
- Yes.
- Is he truly here, sister?
- He will not leave except with you.
So...
I shall wait with you.
"Only Porthos could invent a
new way to disarm himself. "
Get away!
Child, you mustn't cry.
You must look your best for D'Artagnan.
Yes.
- Why is it always have to be me?
- You're getting old.
Where is Rochefort?
We haven't seen him.
Constance!
Constance!
You won't need a horse on the
journey you're taking, Madame.
I warned you, did I not?
Be advised, Gascon! Turn and run!
You murderer!
Bastard!
Stop! Stop fighting!
We are all here as judges.
What is your sentence?
Death.
Death.
Death.
Death.
You are the headsman of me.
As the Comte de la Fere with the
rights of high, middle and low justice,
- I want the death of this woman.
- Five pistoles.
D'Artagnan!
No!
No! You are not my judges.
Take me before a court! It is my right!
No!
You take one more step, D'Artagnan,
and we will cross sword.
I swear to God,
I'll kill you this time.
Two more pistoles for rowing the
boat. I'm a headsman, not a sailor.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Your sword, please! And yours, too!
In the name his eminence, the Cardinal!
I once held out my hand to you.
I do not do so now.
Now you'll stand trial for the murder
of a valued servant of the state.
I fought Milady de Winter
with their own weapons.
So you did. And won. Rochefort,
too, a very considerable achievement.
But your victories are too expensive.
For me and for France.
I hold out France's hand for payment.
I shall not pay one sou, shed one
tear, feel one grain of pity.
Then you must be tried.
You will be condemn.
I think not.
For all that I have done,
I have a proper warrant.
Signed by whom? The Queen
can not, King would not.
By your hand, Your Eminence.
By my hand?
"By my hand and for
the good of the state...
the bearer has done
what has been done."
One should be careful what one writes.
And to whom one gives it.
I must bear those rules in mind.
This is commissioned in the King's
musketeer. The name is blank,
but it is to you I give it.
Your friends are free also.
Good day, Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Athos,
The Cardinal gave me this.
I can't take it. It should go to you.
For the Comte de la Fère
it is too little,
for Athos, it is too much.
You earned it, child.
Aramis, my dear friend.
You're a man of education, of reading.
Please. You're far more
worthy of this than I am.
You forget, I am a
Musketeer only temporarily.
As soon as I find the time, I
intend to be ordain into priesthood.
Look at this. Does it suit
me? / Beautifully, but...
- this would suits you much better.
- Lieutenant!
You flattered me very much. But, no.
One must ask himself...
is the commissioned
something for a gentleman.
But if I'm Lieutenant, I
shall lose all my friends!
A lieutenant is too proud, too
noted for private Musketeers.
Even those who were kind to him when
he first came. Young and foolish.
Running into everyone,
challenge them to fight duels,
making a complete nuisance of himself.
Brawling like a young ruffian with the
Cardinal's guards, while his friends,
older and wiser, trying to restrain
him and keep him out of mischief.
How we guided his faltering, boyish,
foxy, witty, might have gone astray!
We teach the rules high society.
Taught him all of the fine arts
a young gentleman ought to know.
Protected him against enemies and
from temptations of this wicked world.
What would become of him without us?
Or we be without him?
That was from the old days.
When we were indeed:
"One for all and all for one".
